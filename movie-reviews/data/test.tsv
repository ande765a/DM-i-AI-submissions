/m/game_of_death_2020	91002b28-dfb6-3d2d-a5ac-23bf87285efb	3.5	The finely aged brick of cheese that is GAME OF DEATH is sharp and sour to the palette but might take an acquired taste to fully enjoy. And some wine. Or any kind of alcohol. So, you'll probably need to drink to really enjoy this one. I appreciate when actors take such ridiculous concepts so seriously. Their dedication helps me see a story through to the end. The movie also isn't afraid to fill itself with characters that made me uncomfortable.  As for the story, once the game begins, it has good momentum, moving forward thanks to the timer set by the game. Then, while the characters playing the game are m oving forward, we get these odd tonal shifts with entirely different characters seemingly out of nowhere. But side characters turn out to be important. Their interaction with the  main characters brings a shift in the main character's decisions or disrupts their intentions. There's also an alpha and beta story between several characters and within themselves. Some characters are either accepting they're alpha and going forward or discovering they're beta and dying, and the story includes shifts in alpha and beta status.  The game itself is a little tongue in cheek. The invulnerable death game board (shown sunk in water and still functional - get it?) is a 1980s digital game but its introduction plays off like its some ancient curse - as if the 80s is some ancient time. There's a ridiculous callback to the 80s also when one characters is afraid he's contracted AIDS from the device.  Probably the most hilarious parts of this movie aren't the exploding heads, but how such dumb concepts are well thought out.
/m/game_of_death_2020	91002b28-dfb6-3d2d-a5ac-23bf87285efb	3.5	The gratuitous gore is laudable, humorous, and executed adeptly but gore alone is not what should define a movie. The plot is somewhat thin but it does entice the audience to explore existential questions and moral truths, and tops it off with the classic "what would you do" theme. These philosophical and metaphysical concepts are as blatantly obvious as the gore. Overall, they do a decent job at gradually adding depth to the characters and their relationships with each other. However, I might have rated this higher if the end wasn't so disappointing with the philosophical conclusion it forces on the audience.
/m/game_of_death_2020	91002b28-dfb6-3d2d-a5ac-23bf87285efb	1	WARNING TO PARENTS!! On VOD dish, it's rated PG-13. There is NO WAY this should be PG-13. Sexual content in the beginning- masturbating, vagina licking, pedophilic behavior, etc. There is drugs, smoking, alcohol. Very gory and graphic. Rented this because I thought it would be like Nerve. It is NOTHING a THIRTEEN-year-old should watch!!
/m/game_of_death_2020	91002b28-dfb6-3d2d-a5ac-23bf87285efb	0.5	Cringey, terrible acting, and just plain bad.

/m/game_of_death_2020	91002b28-dfb6-3d2d-a5ac-23bf87285efb	0.5	stop ripping off other movie franchises, this was almost the exact pace and tempo of hide and seek or the Belko experiments.
/m/game_of_death_2020	91002b28-dfb6-3d2d-a5ac-23bf87285efb	0.5	Mindless Gore, beyond anything that should be in movies.
/m/game_of_death_2020	91002b28-dfb6-3d2d-a5ac-23bf87285efb	2	Idk about the acting in this one ..... man was that your piss ? Aw ya got me . Very hectic and chaotic . I think the main thing that kept me from liking was the fact none of the characters were likeable . Maybe I’m getting too old 2.2. It was extremely messed up though and I’m sick in that kinda way. There’s nothing worse than watching a movie and knowing if it got into the right hands it coulda been awesome
/m/retaliation_2020	ae5574f7-94c0-3890-a48d-4c25e25c92f7	3	Orlando Bloom is mesmerizing as a troubled adult, who as a child was sexually abused by a priest.  Really edgy performance as he struggles with rage and thoughts of vengeance.   Really compelling for the most part, went into this blind and was glad I did.  Worth a look.
/m/retaliation_2020	ae5574f7-94c0-3890-a48d-4c25e25c92f7	3.5	A complicated topic to grapple with - but Orlando shows all the facets of pain, confusion and longing after being a victim of abuse at the hand of a priest.  The ending is firey.
/m/retaliation_2020	ae5574f7-94c0-3890-a48d-4c25e25c92f7	2	A film like Retaliation is important and should never have to dumb down the graphic subject matter. But aside from a few bright acting moments, the bleak story was very scattered and felt it deserved to be told a lot better than the execution. And that ending is anything but redeeming.
/m/retaliation_2020	ae5574f7-94c0-3890-a48d-4c25e25c92f7	4	Retaliation with Orlando Bloom is a slow moving, uncomfortable drama with a pleasant (?!) twist at the end.
/m/retaliation_2020	ae5574f7-94c0-3890-a48d-4c25e25c92f7	3.5	Orlando give the performance I always thought he could. I really liked how he played his character and the actress who play is girlfriend is so great too. I never had pity for them, it's really more about being strong.  This movie should be translated and played in Québec. The story resonate so much with was is going on in our province.  The only thing I didn't like was how the story was tell. I thought at one point it was a dream but it wasn't and it was weird. It seem like some part of the story was cut. Still, it's a hard subject but it's not hard to watch. I recommend this movie
/m/retaliation_2020	ae5574f7-94c0-3890-a48d-4c25e25c92f7	3	Who knew Orlando Bloom could act? A tough topic well examined (perhaps over-examined?) from the victim's perspective, the film is a bit draggy, but Bloom's performance is surprisingly good and his character's pain is palpable.  No action flick, but lots of violence nonetheless.
/m/retaliation_2020	ae5574f7-94c0-3890-a48d-4c25e25c92f7	3.5	The pace was uneven but the story was electrifying, violent & deeply psychological.
/m/retaliation_2020	ae5574f7-94c0-3890-a48d-4c25e25c92f7	5	Very powerful!  A lot of sex, so maybe don't watch it with your mother-in-law!
/m/retaliation_2020	ae5574f7-94c0-3890-a48d-4c25e25c92f7	0.5	It's like Midsommar all over again. This movie SUCKS!
/m/retaliation_2020	ae5574f7-94c0-3890-a48d-4c25e25c92f7	5	Goodness Orlando Bloom knocked this one out of the park
/m/fishermans_friends	5811ec3a-e893-4e98-b23a-03db2ab3aab5	4.5	This is one of those films that will take you away from your everyday life, and plop you down in a gorgeous little Cornwall fishing village. The great value in a film such as this is its ability to remove you from your living room for a couple of hours and let you forget your troubles.
/m/fishermans_friends	5811ec3a-e893-4e98-b23a-03db2ab3aab5	1.5	At least there was singing?
/m/fishermans_friends	5811ec3a-e893-4e98-b23a-03db2ab3aab5	1.5	The real-life origin story of this musical group watered down into a lifeless, predictable tale of a city slicker being taught the error of his ways by a bunch of country bumpkins who are more than they seem. Nothing original here, and the unoriginal is not particularly well-done.
/m/fishermans_friends	5811ec3a-e893-4e98-b23a-03db2ab3aab5	5	if you have tortured neurons, go your way because this story is the life of simple people, explained simply. a pure moment of happiness
/m/fishermans_friends	5811ec3a-e893-4e98-b23a-03db2ab3aab5	4	Nice clean story (which is hard to come by nowadays). And great sea shanties to boot
/m/fishermans_friends	5811ec3a-e893-4e98-b23a-03db2ab3aab5	4	feel good movie may have to check out their music
/m/fishermans_friends	5811ec3a-e893-4e98-b23a-03db2ab3aab5	2	Lovely scenery. Decent acting. Nice sea shanties. The rest is terrible: flat, predictable, script full of corny second grade level humor; cartoonish, poorly developed characters and amateurish editing. Very difficult to make it through.
/m/fishermans_friends	5811ec3a-e893-4e98-b23a-03db2ab3aab5	5	This film flies below the radar and rewards the viewer with strong "feel good" vibes based on the true story of magnificent harmonies generated by these fishermen.
/m/fishermans_friends	5811ec3a-e893-4e98-b23a-03db2ab3aab5	5	Inspiring true story ! Love it !

/m/the_sunlit_night	821a3bc2-26d3-4455-a94d-bf0fd7152e92	4.5	Elegant, charming, whimsical, visually stunning, touching, and hopeful. Couldn't we all do with a bit more of those elements in our lives?
/m/the_sunlit_night	821a3bc2-26d3-4455-a94d-bf0fd7152e92	3.5	I actually liked it, but not for those who demand continuous distraction.   It was slow and subtle at times but with purpose. It was refreshingly unpredictable and mercifully edited.    The art was certainly skillful, even to the untrained eye.  But the real star was the location, which brought the movie to life.
/m/the_sunlit_night	821a3bc2-26d3-4455-a94d-bf0fd7152e92	5	It's not a Hollywood romance movie, and that's the first good thing about it. Then the arts, the music,and the picturesque landscapes. It's a good movie that reminds us, it's okay to make mistakes. It might seem like the worst thing that could happen to us when they happen, but when we look back after some time, it's actually not that bad after all.
/m/the_sunlit_night	821a3bc2-26d3-4455-a94d-bf0fd7152e92	4.5	A unique, interesting, touching and superbly acted drama that dares to try new things. Slate, as always, is brilliant - as is the cinematography.
/m/the_sunlit_night	821a3bc2-26d3-4455-a94d-bf0fd7152e92	2	So so so pointless. Do not waste your time
/m/the_sunlit_night	821a3bc2-26d3-4455-a94d-bf0fd7152e92	3.5	I was genuinely surprised by the lukewarm reviews on this one.  I thought it was a lovely, quiet, thoughtful little film.  Whoever designed it (I'm thinking here of the barn art project) is genius; rare to find someone of that amount of taste and artistic license to install such a beautiful feature in a film.  I agree with the viewer/critic who said this would be attractive to artists.  I agree. I thought Jenny Slate was good, as were the supporting players - Galifianakis is, as always, a bit over the top, but the role was pretty much written for that. No, I think it was 1 1/2 hour of time well spent to watch this one.
/m/the_sunlit_night	821a3bc2-26d3-4455-a94d-bf0fd7152e92	3.5	Jenny slate is cute but the rest of the film is mediocre
/m/the_sunlit_night	821a3bc2-26d3-4455-a94d-bf0fd7152e92	3.5	It is a cute, quirky, and charming film. Amazing views of Norway. A nice escape from our monotonous and somewhat sad, scary reality right now.
/m/the_sunlit_night	821a3bc2-26d3-4455-a94d-bf0fd7152e92	3	Norway. Pretty much just watch for the scenery.
/m/the_sunlit_night	821a3bc2-26d3-4455-a94d-bf0fd7152e92	4	A great piece for anyone pursuing art. Inspirational but also funny. The theme may not be as well delivered but I love how warm this movie makes me feel.
/m/babysplitters	44f9005e-4013-4bd8-a4ab-0d748ecff416	4.5	I really, really enjoyed it. It's absurdly hilarious with relatable characters and a very entertaining plotline throughout. The cast was brilliant as well (with Danny Pudi delivering the most outstanding performance imo, he absolutely killed it) and I can definitely see myself watching it again.
/m/babysplitters	44f9005e-4013-4bd8-a4ab-0d748ecff416	5	Very cute film! Endearing characters and over the top surprise scenes. I hope they make this into a series.
/m/babysplitters	44f9005e-4013-4bd8-a4ab-0d748ecff416	2.5	Perhaps this simply annoyed a gay, spinster uncle, but watching four straight people over complicate having one child was far more frustrating than humorous. Pudi's boyish 20something "Community" charm has been replaced by all the joy of the bitter, noncommittal 30something millennial who has undershot the earning potential promised to him by growing up in a pre-housing crisis job market. Bitter, spinster, back-in-school millennial, signing out.
/m/babysplitters	44f9005e-4013-4bd8-a4ab-0d748ecff416	5	One of the funniest movies I have ever seen! A really original premise that was extremely well executed. Just a very funny movie!
/m/babysplitters	44f9005e-4013-4bd8-a4ab-0d748ecff416	5	SO FUNNY!   Sam and the team did such a great job with this film! Just what is needed right now in the world. Specific, accurate, and filled with genuine belly laughter!   Highly Recommend!!!
/m/babysplitters	44f9005e-4013-4bd8-a4ab-0d748ecff416	5	danny pudi is a national treasure and the rest of the cast is a delight!
/m/babysplitters	44f9005e-4013-4bd8-a4ab-0d748ecff416	5	So many laugh out loud moments in this very clever, heart warming comedy! And a rare comedic 'set piece' half way thru had me laughing harder than any other film I've seen in theaters since Superbad!
/m/babysplitters	44f9005e-4013-4bd8-a4ab-0d748ecff416	5	I would best describe this movie as it as a feel good smart comedy with a few good twists.  A second coming of age film for those leaving early adulthood and venturing in to the world of parenthood.  My wife and I are expecting and can totally relate to the twin emotions of wanting to start a family while also wanting to preserve the fun aspects of child-free life.  How exactly do two couples create a baby? Watch one of the funniest, most awkward, second-hand-embarrassment inducing sex scenes to find out how!  Definitely worth a watch we were glad that we took the plunge!
/m/babysplitters	44f9005e-4013-4bd8-a4ab-0d748ecff416	5	Great cast, hilarious film, creative writing!
/m/babysplitters	44f9005e-4013-4bd8-a4ab-0d748ecff416	5	This was a really fun movie- I wasn't expecting anything from an Indie but it's one of the better indies out there.
/m/tito	2121be75-9acd-36f0-bbd1-28f24cbd6e7e	5	I was fortunate enough to stumble upon Tito during a flight. While it was unexpectedly found under the comedy section I was nevertheless very glad for my serendipitous discovery. This short film demonstrates the power that comes from the rare combination of good direction of strong young actors who have a challenging and compelling script to work with. Cinematically impressive, this film made me feel uncomfortable in the best way possible. It challenged the assumptions I began to form about these characters and other like them in my life. Enjoyable and wonderful to observe.
/m/tito	2121be75-9acd-36f0-bbd1-28f24cbd6e7e	5	Completely unique, super refreshing to watch, with an unforgettable and audacious performance that changes the game.
/m/guest_artist	930f1dc7-ae83-365e-8d2d-68dc215519c5	1	The movie was boring and slow moving. The lines were shallow and boring. Do not see this film. It is a complete waste of time. There is not one redeeming factor in this film. Pure boredom that makes absolutely no sense, and has no purpose.
/m/guest_artist	930f1dc7-ae83-365e-8d2d-68dc215519c5	0.5	It really suck the story suck hard to understand and low budget movie same people same town am really disappointed since Jeff played in such good movies this was horrible not watching ever again lots of screaming and yelling  And it was drama which those movies suck
/m/samurai_marathon	6845e1ec-f839-30bd-947a-980942a2fde5	2	My wife is descended from a Date clan samurai family and we appreciate a well crafted action, drama or the occasional comedy film in this genre.  We had read glowing reviews and seen the 4/5 star rating for this silly rubbish from ‘acclaimed' director Bernard Rose. Samurai films don't always need to be serious period pieces but the recent trend of contemporary filmmakers, both Japanese and foreign, to stretch the bounds of believability beyond any reasonable historical veracity, in the service of gender politics or attempts at hip humor, leave us empty.  I would term this sub-genre historical comedy, and it's difficult to do well and very easy to do badly.  Samurai Marathon succeeds at failing miserably.  It's not funny and it's not well acted.  We're all sucked into watching it because of the references to an interesting historical event as well as a soundtrack that uses music from Philip Glass.  The opening scenes of a glowering Danny Huston as Commodore Mathew Perry should have clued us in that this was going to be a ‘B' movie, at best.  There are several hunky young Japanese actors in the film whose talents are mostly miserably wasted, who managed to shine more brightly in other recent historical comedies.  The fighting scenes were atrociously stupid, sloppy and unbelievable.  Late in the film Samurai Marathon completely ‘jumped the shark' when it had Japanese comedic actor Naoto Takenaka strip off his outer garments for no reason at all - accept that director Rose must have seen him do this in any number of previous stupid comedy films - and finishes the marathon in nothing but a soggy loincloth.  We're supposed to guffaw at such silliness.  And in the final homage to out of place female empowerment, we're all expected to celebrate that in 1855, the only offspring of the local daimyo, a ‘princess,' is going to be allowed to travel from Annaka domain to Edo /Tokyo all by herself, without an escort, right?  This film is an offense to anyone of us hoping for any interesting period piece without our credulity being tested so baldly.  The real disappointment is that the film employs many good Japanese actors and they are wasted in this rubbish.
/m/samurai_marathon	6845e1ec-f839-30bd-947a-980942a2fde5	4	Samurai Marathon is an unusual movie that really shows potential with its amazing cast, fight scenes and creative storytelling. On top of that, Bernard Rose, the man who brought Candyman, really showed his artistic skills as a director. Overall, Samurai Marathon is a good movie made in Japan during the 2010s.
/m/carmilla_2020	f1f69d13-5001-3979-8c13-979224eee54a	4.5	The way th is movie is riding the genre tropes and it is visual allusions to Coppola's Bram Stalker's dracula and True Blood and the generic period drama to get us to the conclusion is really really good. It is well played and well filmed. An engrossing movie
/m/guest_of_honour	dbd4e2c4-5e44-319f-a270-09e9b88bf331	2	Interesting at times. But 'interesting at times' in a review is never a good thing.  I've seen worse, so two stars. Besides, the logic of the story didn't work for me. I liked the rabbit...till...
/m/guest_of_honour	dbd4e2c4-5e44-319f-a270-09e9b88bf331	3	It is an entrancing and quickly seductive picture with interesting themes/ideas and careful direction but the few flaws it has are glaring and greatly curtail the spell that director Egoyan casts onto the viewer.
/m/guest_of_honour	dbd4e2c4-5e44-319f-a270-09e9b88bf331	3	RABBIT EARS  Used to be rabbit ears pulled in tv channels, now they are a coveted culinary delicacy. If nothing else, one always learns something from an Atom Egoyan film.  Consistently fine thespian David Thewlis as a complicated health inspector, carries "Guest of Honour" with the calm assurance, refined decorum, and meticulous deduction of Sherlock Holmes. Yet it is he who is the mystery. And as wonderful a performance it is (he really does carry the movie), the convoluted and twisty plot proves too benign and lacking, to do justice to foreshadowed expectations.  A forgettable and perplexing storyline involving his jailed daughter is awkwardly distracting at best, and out and out messy at worst. Slipping in a comedic Wilson brother (Luke) as a serious priest is admirable, but alas, serves to sabotage the dramatic flow.  Too bad, as the movie does indeed look great, and Thewlis is excellent, a commanding screen presence, delivering a perfectly nuanced role lacking a worthy supporting cast, and more importantly, a superior written vehicle.  - hipCRANK
/m/the_painted_bird	c5d8e4ec-5316-3c87-9712-696ecbd29134	5	I read "The Painted Bird" 50 years ago and found the reading difficult but ehard to put down. The memories of the book haunted me for years. I later read reviews by critics who accused Kosinski of plagiarizing or inventing his material. Perhaps I had been duped into reading something I should not.   One of the lines of critique engages in the notion that the book--and the movie--are depictions of Nazi Germany. Indeed, the critics say, the scenes did not take place in Germany. The Germans played a small role. It's therefore not a good movie about the Holocaust.   But that's wrong. The greatest excesses of the Holocaust did in fact occur outside of Germany in Eastern Europe. Even German Jews, and for that matter Dutch and French Jews, were deported into Eastern Europe to be murdered.   The story line of the Painted Bird is almost certainly apocryphal, a work of fiction, not a documentary.  Like all fiction, it draws its material from human nature. The various depictions of ugliness provided in the book--and in the movie--might never have been witnessed by any one person, and a few might not have actually ever occurred, and only been invented in the  imaginations of twisted people. But the fact remains the stories are there, the notions of depravity are there.  And the fact remains that in Eastern Europe in the 1940s a massive amount of unspeakable, depraved cruelty happened.   The movie almost perfectly captures Kozinski's story. One can argue whether the story itself should have been told, for the reasons I mentioned above. I believe that it is an important story, not as a document of historical detail, but as a document of human ignorance and cruelty. If we fail to understand that ignorance and cruelty were at the core of the depravity that enveloped Eastern Europe, we have missed not only what happened, but are inviting it to happen again.
/m/the_painted_bird	c5d8e4ec-5316-3c87-9712-696ecbd29134	2	I could barely get through the first half hour, it's too graphic and mean for my tastes
/m/the_painted_bird	c5d8e4ec-5316-3c87-9712-696ecbd29134	2.5	Václav Marhoul made a film and it's pretty graphic and it just doesn't work.  Marhoul produced, wrote and directed 'The Painted Bird' based on the novel and, well, you be the judge.  It was never boring, but more in the way people rubberneck at an accident cleared off to the side of the highway than anything else.  It's a herculean task to get grasp of everything Marhoul is attempting to do and that overambitious effort leads to a miss.  Is it art?  Is it exploitative? Maybe some of column A and some of column B.  Final Score: 5.0/10
/m/the_painted_bird	c5d8e4ec-5316-3c87-9712-696ecbd29134	5	From the opening scene to the very end, I cried. This is not an easy film to watch, I had to cover my eyes at times as a seemly endless parade of human cruelty, inhumanity and depravity marched by; but at the same time, it was touching and beautiful. Beautifully written, acted, filmed and directed. It’s a courageous movie and a testament to the endurance of the human spirit amid almost unimaginable suffering. It leaves you pondering the human condition and the blindness of hatred and prejudice—literally.
/m/the_painted_bird	c5d8e4ec-5316-3c87-9712-696ecbd29134	1.5	Normally I'm all for these types of movies, the really explicit films trying to make a point with artistic merit, challenging their audiencing, and I enjoy and defend these films... but yhis one doesn't have many redeeming values. The critics lie when they say it has emotional impact, it's more of a numbing sensation from being on the other end of a punch-drunk wrestler who just got his life ruined right before his eyes. The movie opens with a sequence of shocking animal cruelty -- points to the film for shock value, creativity, originality, and uses of quietness and minimalism by the way -- and from there it's just 3 hours of scene-after-scene unpleasantness. It's not entertaining, it KIND OF gets a reaction out of you, but it doesn't leave you emotionally compelled just turned off because there's no significance to what you're seeing for either character development, plot, or atmosphere. It's just unpleasant, miserable cruelty for the sake of exploitation and I think it's trying to have a message but it lost what it was in the process, because nothing seems to really correlate other than "let's abuse the little boy on-screen as brutally as possible as many times as possible" and I'm not sure what the point of it all was. There wasn't really a plot, just being passed to different acclaimed actors (Harvey Keitel, Udo Kier, and Stellan Skarsgard) who made me interested in the movie in the first place along with the acclaim. It was more horrific than any horror movie I'd seen despite being labeled a drama. The uncompromisingly bleak visuals do have a sad, memorable beauty to them when something inexcusable isn't happening. There's NC-17 movies I found less unpleasant than this one. Just not a good time in the slightest. It sounds terrible without context, but other war dramas, WWII movies like Schindler's List are at least enjoyable. They're a bit sad, but it's necessary. What scene in this movie feels necessary to the whole? There's no cohesion! Maybe it's my fault for watching an Udo Kier and Stellan Skarsgard movie, like I should've expected Lars Von Trier, but I just wasn't prepared for arthouse horror tonight. I usually love those movies, but those I knew what I was getting into and I never got bored.
/m/the_painted_bird	c5d8e4ec-5316-3c87-9712-696ecbd29134	4	You have to be up for a dark and stark picture that describes much of the human condition.  But if you are up for it, this is a well made and acted film.
/m/the_painted_bird	c5d8e4ec-5316-3c87-9712-696ecbd29134	3	The Painted Bird, based on the bleak-as-all-hell-not-at-all-biographical novel of the same name, is close to 3 hours of a young boy wandering around a continent torn apart by war and, it would seem, 18th century superstition. I picked up the book in 2014 and it was a very compelling read. The horrors it describes are savage and unrelenting, and it doesn't have many moments of levity. It also isn't very long. The movie adaptation is almost 170 minutes, and while it fits in plenty of violence, there's also an absurd amount of downtime. The book was well-paced and always had something going on, but the film often drags its heels, with characters standing around staring at nothing in particular or walking slowly around. It's like the film keeps getting interrupted by an annoying arthouse flick, and you find yourself actually anticipating the violence just to alleviate the tedium, something you didn't get with the book. It's got some fairly big name, but most of the actors you'll recognise have little more than cameos, with the great Stellan Skarsgård not even getting a single word of dialogue. It's a weird combination of Eli Roth torture porn and Terrence Malick arthouse pretentions. Its bloated length is compounded by its languid pacing, and had about an hour been cut out, which is very doable, it would have been an easier watch. I admire the talent and effort which went into it, and when it wants you to sit up and take notice, you always do. Not for the faint of heart, or those with less than 3 hours to kill, but it's a noble effort nonetheless.
/m/the_painted_bird	c5d8e4ec-5316-3c87-9712-696ecbd29134	5	Amazing movie --- heartbreaking, thought-provoking, emotional, and tear jerker.... all the feelings I love from an epic movie like this...
/m/the_painted_bird	c5d8e4ec-5316-3c87-9712-696ecbd29134	4.5	Amazing bleak and poignant
/m/the_painted_bird	c5d8e4ec-5316-3c87-9712-696ecbd29134	4	A few months ago, I reviewed Come And See, a masterful 1985 film which followed a young Soviet boy through the horrors of life during World War II.   Clearly influenced by Jerzy Kosinki's  indelible yet discredited 1965 autobiography, the plot centered around a young Eastern European Jewish boy wandering from town to town towards the end of World War II and experiencing one atrocity after another.  The story may or may not have been true, or perhaps plagiarized or based on someone else's life, but the concept proved unforgettable. Finally brought to the screen by Václav Marhoul, this nearly three hour black and white film may lack the experimentation and cacophony of sound from Come And See, but it possesses gorgeous cinematography, a fantastic central performance, and an intimacy which will punch you in the gut over and over again.    Told in nine chapters named after the people he encounters, The Painted Bird follows a young boy whose parents have left him in the care of a stern but kind elderly relative.  When she dies suddenly, the boy accidentally burns down their rural house and wanders aimlessly from one unnamed town to the next.  As he encounters bigoted villagers, Nazis, sadists, abusers, pedophiles and more, we don't so much see a child lose his innocence as we bear witness to an already benumbed survivor making one tough, soul-changing decision after another.  Marhoul reportedly discovered Petr Kotlár in one of the towns he scouted for the production, and he gives a quiet, observant, stoic performance and does so with almost no dialogue.  Shot over a two year period, one can see the difference in age and body shape from time to time, but his commitment to the role remains hugely impressive. He reminded me of Tatum O'Neal in Paper Moon, in that you believed in his strength and his ability to convey his ever-hardening thoughts.   Marhoul laces the film with many brief but memorable star cameos, most likely to boost international sales.  Udo Kier and Julian Sands make the biggest impressions as two men wrongly entrusted to care for the boy at different times.  Alexsey Kravchenko, who played the young man in Come And See, also appears as a Soviet military officer, clearly passing the torch on to Petr Kotlár.  Although mostly kept offscreen, the film's brutality will likely overwhelm most viewers.  Its stifling, repetitive qualities aim more to keep a record of the terrors millions of people experienced at the time rather than to entertain.  If you're seeking some light entertainment, look elsewhere.  This film evokes words like grueling, harrowing, and uncompromising.    Having said that, The Painted Bird never bored me.  It's grand visuals, courtesy of cinematographer Vladimír Smutný, reminded me of those in Roma.  The framing keeps you off balance and in the shoes of our young protagonist but also serves to convey the scope and scale of the harshness.  One sequence, in which a trainload of Jews attempt to escape from a moving train will stay with me for a long time.  I also appreciated the many setups and payoffs in a film which may feel episodic yet actually builds towards something.  The vastness and stark beauty of the landscapes may look awe-inspiring but feel more hopeless and daunting from the point of view of our main character.    Come And See left me without a shred of hope for humanity, whereas The Painted Bird, whose title refers to a young bird torn apart by a flock because of its differences to them, ends with just the tiniest bit of levity.  We continue to feel the impact of the Holocaust to this day with ever-growing and ever-emboldened hatred of others getting permission to do so from our so-called leaders.  We also navigate the trauma, often left unexamined, in the people who suffered at the hands of monsters. I never want to see The Painted Bird again, but I don't really have to, as I will never forget it.
/m/dont_be_nice	823d56b9-cc3c-318e-a3f5-560ddf122c67	0.5	Bad poetry and cringeworthy performances. If that's what you like, this is your movie!
/m/dont_be_nice	823d56b9-cc3c-318e-a3f5-560ddf122c67	5	What an honor and a privilege. I saw the last screening of this film tonight at the Berkshire International Film Festival in the Shakespeare & Co. parking lot drive-in cinema with the filmmaker present. As a Manhattanite who fled to the hills during the pandemic, this movie was a salve for our troubled times. So on point--so pertinent because it bears witness to our times and what it's like to live in a troubled nation where Black Lives are all often cit too short--like one of the poems that capture the bougie-ness of white girls wearing Black Live Matter t-shirts cut off--too short to matter.   There was a moment when a young poet told a story about his childhood abuse as seen through his eyes in 8 parts. It was so raw and so real. Somewhere in between forgetting to breathe and crying, the transference of this young mans struggle felt so close, as if he was next to me. And he was because that's the power of a great filmmaker who connects his characters to your heart in a way that's as organic as seamless. What an amazing film.
/m/dont_be_nice	823d56b9-cc3c-318e-a3f5-560ddf122c67	5	Absolutely riveting.  This beautiful film is constantly exciting and fast-paced. Amazingly talented new voices are showcased----conveying deep emotions, powerfully revealing messages that yield insights that are a gift. The film is highly relevant for 2020 and beyond.  Wonderful story-telling. You will be glad you saw this.
/m/dont_be_nice	823d56b9-cc3c-318e-a3f5-560ddf122c67	5	Don't Be Nice is Amazing!
/m/dont_be_nice	823d56b9-cc3c-318e-a3f5-560ddf122c67	5	A beautiful story about poetry and the human spirit. Poetry coach Lauren Whitehead and Jon Sands are tasked with coaching a Slam poetry group and getting them to the Nationals. Soon it becomes clear that Lauren's more interested in getting her group to look inward than win the Nationals.
/m/dont_be_nice	823d56b9-cc3c-318e-a3f5-560ddf122c67	5	Amazing commentary on issues of human rights and expression
/m/dirt_music_2019	29a32c64-372c-3269-ae75-4731b9631e67	2	The acting is wooden and the plot garbled, losing much of the nuance of the book
/m/dirt_music_2019	29a32c64-372c-3269-ae75-4731b9631e67	1.5	Slow, dull and a real shame given the cast.
/m/dirt_music_2019	29a32c64-372c-3269-ae75-4731b9631e67	3	It's beautifully shot but ultimately dull and uninteresting. The story isn't deep or impactful in any way and none of the characters grow by the end. Not sure what the point of this film was.
/m/dirt_music_2019	29a32c64-372c-3269-ae75-4731b9631e67	5	Faithful and beautiful adaptation of Tim Winton's emotional novel, excellent performances by all three main characters and just a joy to watch. Gripping from the first scene. No guns violence or special effects, a film about love loss and families. An Australian classic.
/m/dirt_music_2019	29a32c64-372c-3269-ae75-4731b9631e67	5	It was great cinematography and acting. Loved it.
/m/dirt_music_2019	29a32c64-372c-3269-ae75-4731b9631e67	3	Better than the reviews here; though it may help to be Australian or an Australian-ophile.    The Western Australian beach and landscapes - and the folk pop music (Angus and Julia Stone) - are each worth half the admission.     But the scripting the is too melodramatic; and cannot capture the brooding and psychological essence of the novel.
/m/dirt_music_2019	29a32c64-372c-3269-ae75-4731b9631e67	5	Not many films can translate a beautifully written book like Dirt Music onto the screen. This film did. Script, locations, casting, acting, cinematography, soundtrack but most importantly the intensity and delicacy of the themes and the same feeling that you get when you finally put down a book after savouring every page.
/m/dirt_music_2019	29a32c64-372c-3269-ae75-4731b9631e67	5	First of all, this is clearly NOT a bad movie like critics said. It really is a "Dirt Music" and it finds its right key. The acting, the music and the scenery will take you through and engage you emotionally. No regrets for me. Take a step and have a look!
/m/dirt_music_2019	29a32c64-372c-3269-ae75-4731b9631e67	1.5	I can only imagine that the author of the award winning book, this is movie is based on, is just as disappointed as everyone else in this film.   Stripped of all humor or thought , surrounded by beautiful Australian scenery characters do random things while all looking like they are passing painful gas.   Despite a generous runtime, the movie never bothers to explain most of the characters actions and those they do are frankly stupid.   Why is our main character so dissatisfied with her posh life and "not" husband? (never explained) How does a man control a town and live a lavish lifestyle with one beat to shit lobster boat?  (never explained) Why is our moody romantic lead so brooding (explained in a way that caused me to laugh), could it have something to do with he gave up his music (yes)?  What is dirt music? (not explained but from what we get to hear ...its 90s style folk songs played on bluegrass instruments at elevator music pacing)   Who did kill that dog anyway? (We are told but the explanation makes little sense) Are the characters meant to be suicidal or just painfully stupid? (still a mystery after watching).   See it for the visuals of gorgeous beaches or if you are extremely forgiving of "love" stories.  (1 1/2 stars out of 5)....I did read excerpts from the book just to see if it matched the movie , which were funny interior monologues with an edge of poetry...none of which is in the film.
/m/dirt_music_2019	29a32c64-372c-3269-ae75-4731b9631e67	1	The worst film I have seen in a long time! 2 hours of my life I will never get back! Mediocre actors, dull storyline! Don't waste your time or money!
/m/amulet	69577ef0-8e9f-3f76-abb4-64a2ac858978	3	With more confusion than scares, Amulet leaves viewers with questions that demand answers five minutes after the movie ends, until they go do anything else. So… demons need guardians now? Why exactly? So… he (Alec Sacareanu) did kill it (Anah Ruddin)? Was he supposed to kill it from the beginning? Oh, so he's the… ya know what, I'm doing it again. I had very few notes on Amulet. It wasn't bad enough for me to rage-write, but not good enough for me to recommend or really detail. Imelda Staunton commands whatever scene she's in, maybe they should've given her more than three of them. Skip it.
/m/amulet	69577ef0-8e9f-3f76-abb4-64a2ac858978	2.5	Strange, true. Stuff to think about afterwards, yes. But just one really good jump/adrenaline rush and then icky stuff we have seen before.  A bit slow.
/m/amulet	69577ef0-8e9f-3f76-abb4-64a2ac858978	1	1/5 stars only. 1/2 star for one jumpscare only. 1/2 more star for showing very delicious food. The rest is rubbish. Haha.
/m/amulet	69577ef0-8e9f-3f76-abb4-64a2ac858978	1.5	I’m probably spoiled by Ari Aster vision of visual horror movie and it’s story peak - I try to like this movie but it drags i fast forward some scene just to finish it
/m/amulet	69577ef0-8e9f-3f76-abb4-64a2ac858978	2	This movie didn’t have bad acting but it was no fun at all and wasn’t very scary either outside of having a dark feel to it . 2.1
/m/amulet	69577ef0-8e9f-3f76-abb4-64a2ac858978	3.5	If you're not a fan of horror movies with thinly-veiled social commentary as their main theme then this one is probably not for you. But if you do like a film that takes societal conventions and flips them all over the place then I highly recommend Amulet. While not 'scary' per se there is enough suspense and gore to keep longtime horror fans interested.
/m/amulet	69577ef0-8e9f-3f76-abb4-64a2ac858978	4	Weird, kind of cerebral, surprising at times and a twisty ending. Worth a look for a really interesting and unusual film experience. Parts of it make you go "what?" and parts you have to decide for yourself. Carla Juri as Magda is fantastic, and gets better and better as the film progresses.
/m/amulet	69577ef0-8e9f-3f76-abb4-64a2ac858978	4	After watching three terrible horror films in a row, 'Amulet' was a welcome retreat, taking its sweet time to unravel.
/m/amulet	69577ef0-8e9f-3f76-abb4-64a2ac858978	2.5	As someone who loves slow-building, atmospheric horror, this should have really done it for me. But the screenplay and structure of the story just feel too sloppy to fully get into it. I appreciate the way this takes its time in building mood but definitely needed a different approach on how the narrative was constructed. Ari Aster fans will probably dig this though. The ending feels straight out of something he'd do.
/m/amulet	69577ef0-8e9f-3f76-abb4-64a2ac858978	4	Challenging and fascinating. And pretty f’d up.
/m/enter_the_fat_dragon_2020	a0b5f586-0f2e-4840-92ed-6d9f04a5c928	0.5	stupid. loud. interminable. i should have watched a donnie yen movie. oh… wait… i did… at least until i'd had enough. go watch or rewatch any other kung fu movie and you'll make better use of your time.
/m/enter_the_fat_dragon_2020	a0b5f586-0f2e-4840-92ed-6d9f04a5c928	2.5	Fun action sequences. Donnie Yen is great. The egregious racism and anti-Japanese sentiment is offensive and a huge negative.
/m/enter_the_fat_dragon_2020	a0b5f586-0f2e-4840-92ed-6d9f04a5c928	2	Even it is for the Chinese new year, it can be a better and more serious. Well, Wong Jing's movie is that level anyway. Business is business.
/m/enter_the_fat_dragon_2020	a0b5f586-0f2e-4840-92ed-6d9f04a5c928	2.5	I'm paused halfway through it. It has been entertaining, but the choreographed fight scenes get redundant and too implausible--very Jackie Chanish. I don't know if I'll return for the second half.
/m/enter_the_fat_dragon_2020	a0b5f586-0f2e-4840-92ed-6d9f04a5c928	2	Trash film. I love me some Donnie Yen but this was some major crapola. Very boring and not funny. Watch a better movie like the original enter the dragon.
/m/enter_the_fat_dragon_2020	a0b5f586-0f2e-4840-92ed-6d9f04a5c928	2	Typical Wong Jing fare.  An uneven tone with misplaced unfunny humour.  The fact that he's fat barely has anything to do with the story at all and is just a gimmicky excuse to put Donny Yen in a fat suit.  He doesn't even wear the Bruce Lee Game of Death outfit prominently used in marketing material.  Fight scenes are decent, but there are better Donnie Yen films you can watch instead.
/m/enter_the_fat_dragon_2020	a0b5f586-0f2e-4840-92ed-6d9f04a5c928	1.5	It starts funny and fast paced but mid way into the movie it derails in a series of racist jokes and commentaries against Japanese society, liekly intended as government propaganda for domestic alienation.
/m/enter_the_fat_dragon_2020	a0b5f586-0f2e-4840-92ed-6d9f04a5c928	5	Donnie yen like always amazing,fight scenes are incredible unique and the action is perfect well done donnie.
/m/enter_the_fat_dragon_2020	a0b5f586-0f2e-4840-92ed-6d9f04a5c928	5	eggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
/m/enter_the_fat_dragon_2020	a0b5f586-0f2e-4840-92ed-6d9f04a5c928	3.5	Kinetic action comedy that rarely flags in pace, just don't expect more than slapstick style action and broad humour and you'll enjoy it.
/m/blood_vessel	37c26a97-acf6-3d63-9e31-0e3597ffd3f2	3	I give this movie a solid 3 stars. Yes it was predictable as hell but I really liked the look of the vampires. Very cool effects that you don't see anymore.
/m/blood_vessel	37c26a97-acf6-3d63-9e31-0e3597ffd3f2	2.5	BLOOD VESSEL gets us with the cheesy play on words of its title and doesn't let go, instead bombarding us with stereotypical characters and cheesily great practical effects (that maybe could've used alittle more work). It's not a complete bloodbath but it has some gore and decent character moments. I had the impression it follows some beats from Alien/Aliens but with all different characters. What's the saying? "It's good schlock."
/m/blood_vessel	37c26a97-acf6-3d63-9e31-0e3597ffd3f2	2	Not really good. The characters were okay and relatable I guess, but it took a full hour to get anything active and only the remaining half-hour to slowly come to a close. Pretty lame...
/m/blood_vessel	37c26a97-acf6-3d63-9e31-0e3597ffd3f2	2	Silly but overall fun, Blood Vessel is a good pastime so long as you don't take it seriously.
/m/blood_vessel	37c26a97-acf6-3d63-9e31-0e3597ffd3f2	0.5	The writing of this film, particularly the dialogue is seriously cliche.  It's another bad example of a director/screenwriter being creatively lazy and putting all the effort into shock-y schlocky screenshots and grotesque makeup/effects.  The tension never builds because the dialogue and direction are amateurish and all the creative juice is squeezed into the usual shock shots and atmospheric.  Shipwrecked survivors ought to be immediately drawn to food and water not prowling around like horror movie teenagers ala Halloween or Friday the 13th.  This is not worth your viewing time, let alone the price of rental.
/m/blood_vessel	37c26a97-acf6-3d63-9e31-0e3597ffd3f2	5	Started of strong, had a good story the whole way through - Didn't have any "why did they do that" moments or one decision that made the whole story change which is what I like. 100% recommend watching - A few jump scares which was a nice touch as well the lighting a camera work was great, wasn't any snappy movements or quick motion. The accents, make up and acting was very good, could compare the film to Overlord.
/m/blood_vessel	37c26a97-acf6-3d63-9e31-0e3597ffd3f2	0.5	I wasn't expecting Schindler's List, I was expecting Nazi getting their butts staked on a ship. Further into the movie when the cookie cutter tropes that constituted the characters were established, I figured, kay, more Event Horizon angle, can work with that. Nah, not even that. Just people wandering around a boat arguing for an hour. Then in the last 30 minutes some decent looking vampires show up, but only after the scene where the black guy is killed by gunfire, the Russian guy behind him takes a bullet to the arm, and the medic steps over the dead guy's body like he wasn't there and super worried tends to the Russian guy. No one even acknowledges the dead black guy. I know it's WWII, but everyone was JUST talking to the dude. The hell? Whole rest of the movie I couldn't have cared less what happened to those people tbh.
/m/blood_vessel	37c26a97-acf6-3d63-9e31-0e3597ffd3f2	5	Fun little horror adventure, idk why everyone wanted an Avengers endgame type production. Like y’all picky asf for no reason, just cause it was “cliche” like stfu. It’s basically a sci fi type movie and everyone knew it from the trailer. So don’t watch it ur a movie twat who hates sci fi stuff.
/m/blood_vessel	37c26a97-acf6-3d63-9e31-0e3597ffd3f2	1.5	What could have been an alright premise for a horror movie was handled terribly. There were a couple of tense moments here, but they were few and far between. I imagine it wasn't intentional, either, but the first half felt entirely different to the second. I genuinely enjoyed the first half, but as soon as the laughably cringy villain came into it, it felt more like a parody than straight up horror. Heck, I think it would have worked better as a comedy if they were going to do something like this. While generally acted okay, I also cannot forgive the horrible red screen effects. For anyone considering watching, I'd unfortunately give it a miss.
/m/blood_vessel	37c26a97-acf6-3d63-9e31-0e3597ffd3f2	1	You know those movies where there's a group of (often random) people thrown together and they all seem to have the same personalities in each movie? One is the bad guy, one is the hero, one is the smart one, etc. This movie had that, as well as various other very familiar horror plots. Like so many films before 'Blood Vessel,' there was some early intrigue before it fell off the rails by its second half. This might have worked better as a video game?!
/m/the_rental_2020	184889dc-1755-36b0-9d78-82fb5e0cea66	4	Great story with no cliches, the complicated relationships among the characters associated with the unrevealed maniac behind the rented house guaranteed a great movie experience. Loved.
/m/the_rental_2020	184889dc-1755-36b0-9d78-82fb5e0cea66	2	I sort of missed the point of this movie completely, it seems. It builts and it builts -in a bit of a campy way- and then it concludes. But to what exactly? What is the motive? What happens next?
/m/the_rental_2020	184889dc-1755-36b0-9d78-82fb5e0cea66	1	Waste of my time! Wouldn't recommend!
/m/the_rental_2020	184889dc-1755-36b0-9d78-82fb5e0cea66	3	The Rental is an okay film. It about two couples who rent a vacation home for what should be a celebratory weekend get-away. Dan Stevens and Alison Brie give decent performances. The screenplay is a little slow in places. Dave Franco did an alright job directing this movie. I liked this motion picture because of the drama and mystery.
/m/the_rental_2020	184889dc-1755-36b0-9d78-82fb5e0cea66	2	Seriously slow going, you will not realize it's a horror movie until it's almost over
/m/the_rental_2020	184889dc-1755-36b0-9d78-82fb5e0cea66	3.5	Disturbing little movie, makes you think about Airbnb in a different way.
/m/the_rental_2020	184889dc-1755-36b0-9d78-82fb5e0cea66	3.5	You'll never look at an Air BNB rental the same.
/m/the_rental_2020	184889dc-1755-36b0-9d78-82fb5e0cea66	4	Not quite the scare I was after, but a good solid thrill with stakes that felt real.
/m/the_rental_2020	184889dc-1755-36b0-9d78-82fb5e0cea66	3.5	I think the characters were acted well enough, and the situation drew me in for a while, but I was seriously disappointed with the way everything came together, with the movie ultimately seeming to have no point to me by the end.
/m/the_rental_2020	184889dc-1755-36b0-9d78-82fb5e0cea66	3.5	It was really good. Not suoer original, buy good acting wnd execution. I enkoyed it.
/m/most_wanted_2020	8fb861ab-2ec1-35b0-8790-af8297a15618	3	Good setup, poor follow through
/m/most_wanted_2020	8fb861ab-2ec1-35b0-8790-af8297a15618	4	An all around great low budget film than needed a little more punch. Newb filmmaker Daniel Roby wrote, produced and directed this true-events film. Everything was on point, and although I'm not a fan of time-shifting stories, Roby did this well enough, that the somewhat slow pace didn't make the 125 min runtime feel long at all.  It was a great story that needed to be told, and although told well enough, imo, it could've used a little Hollywood punch to elevate it. The casting was good and the performances were convincing. It was shot well, with an excellent score, and the sets and cinematography fit the timeline perfectly.  Roby should be very proud of this little gem. Don't go into this one expecting a big budget Hollywood-style action thriller, but more as a well put together docu-story that should be seen. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me.
/m/most_wanted_2020	8fb861ab-2ec1-35b0-8790-af8297a15618	2	The buildup to what ultimately happens in this case is interesting to watch but eventually it becomes a long and tedious journey that tries to throw in every detail of the story while the character portrayal of Daniel Leger becomes muddled. Casting Jim Gaffigan as Glen Picker is probably the best thing about this film.
/m/most_wanted_2020	8fb861ab-2ec1-35b0-8790-af8297a15618	3	All of the elements and characters are here for a truly gripping first-rate crime thriller, but the film testifies that the makers didn't know what to do with the pure gold they had and lost track of the story's power.  Gaffigan, Hartnett and Pilon are absolutely brilliant -- shocking good casting. I've never seen Pilon before and he's impressive. Gaffigan turns in a character I never dreamed he is capable of. Hartnett takes a run-of-the-mill crusader and makes him interesting and understandable. This trio brings real depth.  Unfrotunately  none of the agents sees beyond the surface of their characters, and zero of the Thai players are developed.  One of the best things about the movie is that the stupid shaky hand-held camerawork of the first half -- much of it unnecessary, sea-sickening and pointless -- mostly stops for the second half.
/m/most_wanted_2020	8fb861ab-2ec1-35b0-8790-af8297a15618	2	Very confusing. Lost the whole time until the end. Great story. Poorly told. Not worth watching.
/m/most_wanted_2020	8fb861ab-2ec1-35b0-8790-af8297a15618	4	I enjoyed it. Crazy story
/m/most_wanted_2020	8fb861ab-2ec1-35b0-8790-af8297a15618	2.5	Hartnett's character and family is way underdeveloped.  Gaffigan is surprisingly good.  But all in all - you're supposed to be really rooting for the poor heroin using kid that's being used as a scapegoat - but the plot isn't cooked enough to get you there.
/m/most_wanted_2020	8fb861ab-2ec1-35b0-8790-af8297a15618	4	Wow, what a crazy story. Well told thriller..
/m/most_wanted_2020	8fb861ab-2ec1-35b0-8790-af8297a15618	3.5	This suspenseful thriller was great. Josh Hartnett, Antoine Olivier Pilon, Stephen McHattie, Jim Gaffigan, Amanda Crew, and the rest of the cast did an excellent job in this movie. This true story was dramatic, inspirational, and shocking. These two men took down the federal police in Canada by exposing the conspiracy and corruption that they committed. That's courageous and heroic. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's worth watching.
/m/most_wanted_2020	8fb861ab-2ec1-35b0-8790-af8297a15618	3	It isn't Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic", not by a long shot - but if you like drugs & cops & smuggling flicks it serves its purpose. Good to see Josh Hartnett getting a paycheck again.

/m/legacy_of_lies_2020	6f19570c-fda7-3c91-b68e-471206c7c577	0.5	Dumb, dumber, and even dumber.
/m/legacy_of_lies_2020	6f19570c-fda7-3c91-b68e-471206c7c577	2	A very mundane, run-of-the-mill spy plot whose only purpose is to move the movie along from one fight sequence to another.  Unfortunately, the action sequences are too few and far between, so that there are significant periods where the movie must rely on the plot and the acting to entertain.  This is where the major flaws of the movie reveal themselves.  The plot has been done a thousand times, as has the big, bad spy being threatened with the life of his daughter.  Absolutely no originality.
/m/legacy_of_lies_2020	6f19570c-fda7-3c91-b68e-471206c7c577	2	Pretty run of the mill thriller. Clunky dialogue, illogical plot, uncharismatic hero. Why the critics approved, god knows. But the fight scenes were quite good!
/m/legacy_of_lies_2020	6f19570c-fda7-3c91-b68e-471206c7c577	2	Il est vraiment formidable de découvrir que Scott Adkins sait aussi bien s'entourer qu'un Steven Seagal des 80s, avec des réalisateurs qui ont beaucoup de choses à raconter et qui sont bloqués par leur condition de cable-TV fodder, donc forcés de cacher leur discours derrière des histoires de vengeance incompétentes. Legacy of Lies est un film beaucoup plus propre et beau que ce qu'il devrait être. Malheureusement, aussi charismatique qu'il puisse être, Adkins ne peut sauver ses collègues, tous plus nuls les uns que les autres, et un scénario qui dit en trois fois ce qu'il pourrait faire en une. De ce fait, Legacy of Lies n'est absolument pas à voir, il est même presque parfois d'un ennui mortel. Mais il est vraiment beaucoup plus intéressant qu'il n'est réussi et ne serait-ce que pour cela, Legacy of Lies n'est pas un coup d'épée dans l'eau.
/m/legacy_of_lies_2020	6f19570c-fda7-3c91-b68e-471206c7c577	4	I found 'Legacy of Lies' on Tubi and expected little to nothing in terms of cinematography, action, and engagement because of the average movie quality found on this website. Surprisingly, this movie reminds me of John Wick 3: Parabellum in terms of the aforementioned three points--Scott Adkins at his best. Thanks, Scott.
/m/legacy_of_lies_2020	6f19570c-fda7-3c91-b68e-471206c7c577	4	Scott Adkins soars in Legacy of Lies (2020).  Legacy of Lies is Adrian Bol's "Cold War" style spy thriller built around the familiar fight between the intelligence communities of the East and West for spy secrets.    Adkins plays Martin Baxter, a former MI6 intelligence officer whose final mission set off the personal genesis for film's title, the Legacy of Lies.  While in voluntary exile with his daughter he is faced with no choice but to re-enter the espionage game in order to save the life of the person most precious to him.    Members of the worldwide martial arts community have seen Adkins, an authentic, trained martial artist, rise to the heights of success in the martial arts film genre with such winners as Savage Dog (2017), The Accident Man (2018), and the Debt Collector films (2018 & 2020).   While Adkins has made his share of films outside the martial arts action genre, Legacy of Lies is the first prominent non-martial arts, action film in which he commands the leading role.  He does so masterfully.  Adkins plays Martin Baxter with grit, depth, and vulnerability while still maintaining his masculine, "kick -ass" demeanor.  His performance makes it hard not to feel empathy for this conflicted anti-hero.  The film has the opportunity to expose Scott Adkins to an entirely new viewing audience, as Legacy of Lies is not merely a martial arts action film, but a well-crafted, well-executed, dramatic spy thriller with appeal to a broad viewing audience.  It may be hard for viewers not to crave more Adkins content after this one.  In addition to the powerful performance by Adkins, the supporting cast is stellar in their roles.  They offer complexity to their performances and offer more than the simplistic two dimensional cliche'd "good guys and bad guys" of most spy films.  The supporting cast includes  Honor Kneafsey, Martin McDougall, Yuliia Sobol, Tom Ashley,  Anna Butkevych, Leon Sua, Victor Solé, and Tetiana Nosenko.  Adrian Bol's script and direction are the masterful foundation upon which this engaging and enjoyable house is built.   Make no mistake; while this is an intelligent, spy thriller, it is also packed with fights and action from the opening moments.  The seasoned partnership of Tim Man and Scott Adkins for the fight and stunt choreography delivers top-notch, fight scenes.  With this collaboration, unlike many conventional, contemporary action films, in which "shaky cam" has become the tool in which the filmmakers subjugate the action to the storyline, the fights here are gritty, raw, and close up.    Legacy of Lies has it all- a good story, good directing, good acting and good fighting.  The cinematography makes the film, much of which is set against the backdrop of the Ukraine, very watchable.  Legacy of Lies hits stores and VOD on July 28, 2020. I highly recommend this film.  It is not only one of the best films of 2020,  it is one of the best espionage thrillers of the past decade.  The film is Rated R for violence, language and some sexuality/nudity
/m/legacy_of_lies_2020	6f19570c-fda7-3c91-b68e-471206c7c577	3	Decent action flick always great fight scenes with Scott Adkins
/m/legacy_of_lies_2020	6f19570c-fda7-3c91-b68e-471206c7c577	2.5	The antagonists are the definition of cliché. The movie really tries to make an emotional connection with the main character, but it seems impossible judging by his actions. Sometimes it seems that the antagonists have more values than him. The script often facilitates, mostly when the main protagonist is able to enter high-security buildings without any effort, and most of the time he just shows up inside the building.  The fight scenes are very good, but it seems to suffer from some realism because a lot of times it seems that he doesn't feel any of the hits he takes. The message is very effective and the idea about preserving free speech is a good reminder of what democracy stands for. So, this movie has its merits, but its flaws are very evident to ignore. The chemistry between the main character and his daughter is convincent and the trauma of the past works in a certain way to create mystery around the main protagonist's decisions of life and his character. Its not a good movie, but its not a terrible one, its the kind of movie that you wont watch it again, (4/10)
/m/legacy_of_lies_2020	6f19570c-fda7-3c91-b68e-471206c7c577	2.5	Passable but generic and in the end rather heavy handed spy thriller. Scott Adkins is ever dependable but the plot, although borrowing from real life events in places still manages to be vague and nonsensical.
/m/flannery	38d8a5f9-46fb-4be0-a870-fd252cfe8625	5	In the vein of a Ken Burns' documentary, this one tells the story of an often misunderstood Southern Catholic writer of the mid-20th Century.  Mary Flannery O'Connor ... who took the Southern novel/short story and turned it on its head ... is lovingly dealt with in this movie.  Dying at 39, just when her literary genius was getting going, O'Connor wrote because she HAD to write ... she couldn't care less for her critics (whether critical of her stories or critical of her religion) ... what an amazing woman.  This documentary is a MUST-See for anyone interested in Catholic authors ... Southern authors ... American literature ...
/m/flannery	38d8a5f9-46fb-4be0-a870-fd252cfe8625	5	I haven't seen the movie yet, only the trailor. How can I get a copy?
/m/flannery	38d8a5f9-46fb-4be0-a870-fd252cfe8625	5	One of the best bio-docs I've seen. Comprehensive, well researched, and artfully presented. The fusion of narration, photos, archival interview footage with music and animation is brilliant.  Much like O'Connor was not your typical writer, Flannery is not your typical documentary.  Lit geeks, Teachers, Readers, O'Connor fans...worth your time.
/m/flannery	38d8a5f9-46fb-4be0-a870-fd252cfe8625	5	Beautifully done. Superb.
/m/flannery	38d8a5f9-46fb-4be0-a870-fd252cfe8625	5	I thought it was fantastic!
/m/useless_humans	7d7c6043-e2e8-40ac-b280-1e989770852b	3	I know I saw this not gonna watch again
/m/useless_humans	7d7c6043-e2e8-40ac-b280-1e989770852b	1	Bad acting and a weak storyline. Some potential when the movie started but that faded quick. People rated this junker at 91%?! They watch the same movie? I don't understand...
/m/useless_humans	7d7c6043-e2e8-40ac-b280-1e989770852b	2.5	Decent watch at best, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.  It starts as a bad "I wish we were still in college" movie, and barely leaves it as aspects of an alien invasion movie begins.  While they actually have an interesting concept to work with, an alien that feeds off of electricity, it looks like some alien costume they borrowed from a friend of a friend's cousin's uncle, but his dog just uses it as a hump toy.  Then they put some poor guy inside it and too no time to make it a believable performance.  It's honestly pretty forgettable, which is disappointing because I actually recognized some of the actors as funny.  Give this a skip unless you are just really running low on things to watch.
/m/useless_humans	7d7c6043-e2e8-40ac-b280-1e989770852b	0.5	why even make such a stupid movie that isn't funny. if I were high, still wouldn't be funny. it was that bad
/m/useless_humans	7d7c6043-e2e8-40ac-b280-1e989770852b	5	Very funny film. It is a little cheesy and very corny... but that's what you get when you watch a movie like this. If you don't walk away from this film very entertained than you made a bad selection. The casting is amazing (Shout out to the casting director) and the set pieces and comedic timing of the lead is on point.
/m/useless_humans	7d7c6043-e2e8-40ac-b280-1e989770852b	0.5	Horrible acting and writing. Not even one of those so bad it's good.
/m/useless_humans	7d7c6043-e2e8-40ac-b280-1e989770852b	3	A  Low budget movie, was just eh... thus my three star rating!
/m/useless_humans	7d7c6043-e2e8-40ac-b280-1e989770852b	4	Group of four meet every year at a cabin. This time it's invaded by aliens. Acting wasn't bad but a little corny.
/m/useless_humans	7d7c6043-e2e8-40ac-b280-1e989770852b	4	If you're just looking for something fun and a little silly; this is it!
/m/useless_humans	7d7c6043-e2e8-40ac-b280-1e989770852b	3.5	Great for fans of sci-fi comedies or stoner/buddy comedies like PAUL. Great chemistry between cast members and a very funny final twist.
/m/easy_does_it	8a3ee249-2d8c-351f-b6e0-b4d18984e736	5	I'm biased BUT it's a fun and goofy little movie. Good summer stoner joint!
/m/easy_does_it	8a3ee249-2d8c-351f-b6e0-b4d18984e736	5	Hilarious, fast paced crime adventure.  The heroes are 2 guys with Peter Pan syndrome.  The baddies are 2 women mouth breathers.  Grab some popcorn and cold beers...or...whatever...fall back on your sofa and let this experience wash over you.  Its not deep. its escapism at its visual and audio best!
/m/easy_does_it	8a3ee249-2d8c-351f-b6e0-b4d18984e736	5	An honest throwback tale of genuine lowbrow characters on the run from hardship. Hilariously thrilling with a comic book feel, the movie kept us rooting for our heroes, waiting to find out what was around the next corner. Must see, Indie film magic from start to finish.
/m/easy_does_it	8a3ee249-2d8c-351f-b6e0-b4d18984e736	4.5	Honestly, I loved it. I see why some people didn't-- it's very goofy and very experimental/weird at times. But I thought it was a really fun road movie with everything I want out of that-- great car chases, crime and other hijinks etc.  But then what really hits you is this sweet friendship story at the movie's core. It's also totally a perfect stoner movie! Lol. If you just wanna have a good time for 90 minutes this is a pretty dang good way to do it.
/m/easy_does_it	8a3ee249-2d8c-351f-b6e0-b4d18984e736	5	Great road trip film! Engaging with fun and quirky characters. Must see indie film!
/m/easy_does_it	8a3ee249-2d8c-351f-b6e0-b4d18984e736	0.5	A huge misfire for Linda Hamilton's career but also a big waste of time for the audience.
/m/easy_does_it	8a3ee249-2d8c-351f-b6e0-b4d18984e736	5	The movie is splashy.  Definitely a fun time at the movies.  OR your living room.  Wherever you watch movies now.  Favorite part:  The music throughout is great.  Also, the first gas station scene.  It's a great balance of tension and comedy.
/m/easy_does_it	8a3ee249-2d8c-351f-b6e0-b4d18984e736	5	Easy Does It is a surprisingly fun and inventive movie! Its fast paced and entertaining, especially for an independent film. Although a buddy comedy at heart, its also stylish and inventive, with a lot of great music (including Funkadelic) and inventive photography that felt artistic and fresh -- but didnt detract from the laughs and all the action.  My one criticism was the poster. I didnt realize it was Linda Hamilton, looked like some creepy dude. But her part was actually quite good, I didnt know she had that kind of acting range! Just dont be out off by the poster!  Really enjoyed it, felt like a low budget arthouse version of an action buddy comedy, and somehow it totally worked
/m/easy_does_it	8a3ee249-2d8c-351f-b6e0-b4d18984e736	0.5	Holy crap mivie this was horrible. It feels like the director was going for it a Quinton Tarantino vibe but, it failed miserably. This was 95 minutes I'll never get back.
/m/easy_does_it	8a3ee249-2d8c-351f-b6e0-b4d18984e736	5	This movie is an excellent summer adventure comedy with commentary on the condition of the American dream, and the pursuit of new horizons.
/m/a_nice_girl_like_you	b661f0cd-32b2-3934-ab7a-ca313568f3ea	4	I don't get why there are so many negative reviews... I mean, it wasn't a perfect movie or anything, but it wasn't horrible. I actually laughed out loud many times. Sure, it has its flaws, but I had a good time watching it.
/m/a_nice_girl_like_you	b661f0cd-32b2-3934-ab7a-ca313568f3ea	3	I... actually kinda like this? It's dumb no doubt, but it works.  Just narrowly, I will say that. 'A Nice Girl Like You' does feature moments that don't come out well, though I honestly didn't dislike watching it all unfold. There are a couple of funny moments, particularly one lippy bit, and Lucy Hale (Lucy) makes for an enjoyable lead.  It's an amusing and fun premise. Of course it is nothing near perfect and I was extremely close to rating it a notch lower, yet I think it has enough to it to make it a worthwhile watch. I can, admittedly, see it splitting opinion. As noted, Hale is the star but I also found Jackie Cruz (Nessa) and Mindy Cohn (Pricilla) decent.  The film is directed by The Brothers Riedell, two guys I in fact used to watch years and years back when they were doing YouTube and Internet Icon. I seem to recall enjoying their content on there so it's nice to see them making films nowadays. I still remember their subscribe song/outro thing seven+ years on...  Every now and then I find a film that isn't all that great but I still have a fine time with it, this is one of those occasions. Not gonna lie, I'm cool with this.
/m/a_nice_girl_like_you	b661f0cd-32b2-3934-ab7a-ca313568f3ea	0.5	This movie was woeful. The only part of this movie was some don speaking in French for 2 seconds. Would fully not recommend. Watch White chicks instead for a good time
/m/a_nice_girl_like_you	b661f0cd-32b2-3934-ab7a-ca313568f3ea	3	While I liked the concept of getting women to understand the importance of owning their sexuality, the need to include a romance in the mixture really made the whole plot a bit confusing. Should she be focusing on her sexuality for "self-discovery" or in her new love interest. Is she now having attentive sex? While that part of the story was lacking, also the romantic side was missing those moments that allow you to build a true connection to the couple; thus, you aren't really rooting for them to end up together. While there were some funny moments, the whole time I was distracted by Lucy Hale's lips, they honestly looked like she just got fillers the night before. Not a movie you want to watch attentively, something to pass the time or have in the background.
/m/a_nice_girl_like_you	b661f0cd-32b2-3934-ab7a-ca313568f3ea	3.5	Silly but fun. The male character is portrayed as not having any issues, which makes it somewhat hard to stomach that the script has him act dickish at one point to create the typical romcom setback. The female character is very naive about sex, to a degree that may seem unrealistic until you start viewing her as being on the autistic spectrum. That also gels with her wanting to make lists of everything all the time.
/m/a_nice_girl_like_you	b661f0cd-32b2-3934-ab7a-ca313568f3ea	1.5	I shoulda trusted the rating 1.7
/m/a_nice_girl_like_you	b661f0cd-32b2-3934-ab7a-ca313568f3ea	0.5	I think this movie had the potential to put forward some really powerful messages around female sexuality and empowerement, but instead it fell completely flat and problematic. It presented to me with a very narrowminded view of sex and female sexuality, falling into the 'virgin or whore' trope that, in the 21st century really needs to be put in the bin for good. Massive let down, would not recommend.
/m/a_nice_girl_like_you	b661f0cd-32b2-3934-ab7a-ca313568f3ea	4	Super cute movie - Lucy Hale is  totes adorbs but it really angers me that the story basically amounts to "not into sex? you just haven't met the right person." Asexuality continues to be treated disdainfully in Hollywood. But she's so cute.
/m/a_nice_girl_like_you	b661f0cd-32b2-3934-ab7a-ca313568f3ea	0.5	Overall, I am incredibly disappointed with this film on so many levels. Lucy Hale once again is generally trying, but her character is weak, silly and filled with cringe moments from start to finish. The attempted humour here is awful and off-putting to the point that I almost turned the film off and gave up. The film's plot is just sad and could have delivered a much better message such as it's ok to be yourself or don't let others influence you etc. Instead, the film is a mess with no real purpose or meaning, and when it tries, it changes its mind within seconds.  I'm surprised this film is based on a famous memoir, because for me it is a strong contender for the worst movie of 2020.  - Walkden Entertainment
/m/a_nice_girl_like_you	b661f0cd-32b2-3934-ab7a-ca313568f3ea	3.5	Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.  I don't think this is one anyone is going to watch over and over, but it's a great one-shot.  Lucy Hale is amazing, and I'll admit I wasn't a big fan of her character on "Pretty Little Liars", but it really seems that she can elevate any role she takes, this one included.  I honestly have a very short list of actresses that could have pulled this off as well as she did.  There was also a fun appearance by Jackie Cruz ("Orange is the New Black") with fun hair which was funny to see her expand her range, just a little, as the last time I saw her she was a scientist in "Tremors: Skrieker Island".  The story is a little odd, but it's designed as a "slice of life" sort of rom-com, so the setting is so allegedly normal to contrast the main character as odd in the idea that she's not into sex.  I'm really torn on the movie's key concept that she's odd for not being overly sexual or that she's not because she's so uptight.  Regardless, she has a fun little list of things to do, but she's clearly going to do it once and move on.  I'm a fan of "try it once, and if you don't like, then you can never do it again", but we're told to laugh at someone being brave about this.  While the movie is supposed to be about her growth as a character, she clearly isn't designed to actually growth, just get out of her own way long enough to open her to a new experience of a new man, and then have that same openness become a conflict.  I'd say that was a spoiler, but I think that is part of the movie's concept.
/m/the_silencing	052d426e-5308-37c8-b21e-6979e3aedfad	2	The plot is full of holes. Audience is not stupid.
/m/the_silencing	052d426e-5308-37c8-b21e-6979e3aedfad	3.5	Despite obvious shortcomings, the story maintains your interest until the end.     Isolationist Rayburn Swanson is responsible for a large animal sanctuary bordering on an Indian reservation. Former hunter, now guardian of the wild.  Swanson comes across a speechless girl being hunted like an animal in his protected area.  The hunter kidnaps his victims and then turns them loose in the wild so he can hunt them down using an ancient weapon which slings long, deadly arrows.  An atlatl.  An interesting pursuit occurs.
/m/the_silencing	052d426e-5308-37c8-b21e-6979e3aedfad	2.5	It was okay. I tried this because I recognized the guy from "Game of Thrones". Nothing to write home about, but far from being terrible.
/m/the_silencing	052d426e-5308-37c8-b21e-6979e3aedfad	4	Keep me interested right until the end.  Critics, WRONG AGAIN!
/m/the_silencing	052d426e-5308-37c8-b21e-6979e3aedfad	4.5	Loved it. Thrilling and exciting
/m/the_silencing	052d426e-5308-37c8-b21e-6979e3aedfad	2	Silence is not golden, my friend.  The movie defies logic; it may have action, but the actions make no sense.  The critics were on point with this.  The audience review also defies logic... Y'all watchin' the same movie I am?
/m/the_silencing	052d426e-5308-37c8-b21e-6979e3aedfad	4	For this movie the critics' rating is as good as sh*t!
/m/the_silencing	052d426e-5308-37c8-b21e-6979e3aedfad	3.5	"The Silencing" is certainly better than the ridiculous 13% that the professional critics gave it, but not as high as the audience critics rating. The acting was good, and I had no clue who the actual killer was until the end. There are, however, a lot of unanswered questions as well as red herrings that should have been taken into account that I won't mention because I don't want to spoil it. I'm actually glad the audience critics gave it a high rating or I wouldn't have watched it. I would give it around 70-75%. So, yeah, it's definitely watchable. I was never bored.

It is pretty well done, with good acting and while the story is pretty linear it has interesting points and keeps your attention the whole time. There are no black and white characters, but rather it shows how people make mistakes and try to make up for them. It is also a story of redemption.
/m/the_silencing	052d426e-5308-37c8-b21e-6979e3aedfad	3.5	Enjoyed this film even though plot is not something we haven't seen before
/m/showbiz_kids	89b338f8-bd34-4922-a754-88fc73e3d413	4	A slight peek at the lives, whether raised in or adopted into, of beloved child stars and the delights and costs of fame at a young age.
/m/showbiz_kids	89b338f8-bd34-4922-a754-88fc73e3d413	4	Showbiz Kids is a thoughtful, detailed look into the lives of child acting stars. With good interviews with people like Todd Bridges, Evan Rachel Wood, Will Wheaton and many more we get a glimpse into a life that most of us can never experience. This doco nicely shows us the different life style, the pitfalls of fame and also sadly the abuse that some are subjected to into this way of life. Very worthwhile documentary.
/m/showbiz_kids	89b338f8-bd34-4922-a754-88fc73e3d413	2.5	Could've done without the reality TV element.
/m/showbiz_kids	89b338f8-bd34-4922-a754-88fc73e3d413	2.5	Great premise, but with the title "Showbiz Kids" certain Showbiz Kids come to mind. Those kids however are not subjects interviewed or discussed in the film. The people in this documentary felt like they would have been better served with a docu-series to thoughtfully examine their unique stories as opposed to clustering them together in an effort to highlight cliche themes that have/are continuously explored in a variety of different mediums rendering this documentary as a promising idea that could have been executed a bit better. The documentary is at its best when it does center in on the unique stories from Evan Rachel Wood, Will Wheaton, Mara Wilson, and Henry Thomas. It functions as a pretty good casual stream, but lacks the premium quality HBO is typically known for.
/m/stockton_on_my_mind	4fd69721-00a2-3318-8d25-6cea462d070a	2.5	Paints a pretty rosy picture of Stockton and Mayor Tubbs.
/m/deep_blue_sea_3	07cf774b-17b5-318e-b892-f87d5b9fcc44	4	la película es bastante aceptable, no es terrible como su secuela la cual aparte de aburrida tediosa aunque admito que me gusto la segunda parte (gusto culposo) pero bueno, la 3ser película entrega una historia mediocre que bueno no llega a ser tan mala y tampoco supera a la original pero es muy divertida y buena en los parámetros de películas de tiburones malas y si buscas una película de tiburones malas en los parámetros de películas de serie b, esta es una gran opción!.
/m/deep_blue_sea_3	07cf774b-17b5-318e-b892-f87d5b9fcc44	2	2/5.  It has some fun kills and some entertaining moments, but a lot of this movie is a snooze-fest.
/m/deep_blue_sea_3	07cf774b-17b5-318e-b892-f87d5b9fcc44	3	2 and a half sort of but it gets to 3 in the climax. The kills are crazy at times, and the film puts in a good mix of action and horror. I like the little town setting where the whole little island is a town. This is better then 2, but not as good as 1.
/m/deep_blue_sea_3	07cf774b-17b5-318e-b892-f87d5b9fcc44	3	Story plot quality really need some improvement, just lame brainless no sense actions & suspense. What just happpened? Not even come close to the original even the lame CGs.
/m/deep_blue_sea_3	07cf774b-17b5-318e-b892-f87d5b9fcc44	4	As good as the original. Really good for a shark film.
/m/deep_blue_sea_3	07cf774b-17b5-318e-b892-f87d5b9fcc44	5	I didn't like it but I'm giving it 5 stars to offset "David R" giving it 1 star bc they mentioned climate change and women being equal. Why are people so terrified of a different perspective? Grow up, David R.
/m/deep_blue_sea_3	07cf774b-17b5-318e-b892-f87d5b9fcc44	3.5	Better than that last attempt. The sharks are looking really good these days in CGI. I thought the setting was pretty cool on that man-made island. Some of the characters were a bit annoying, I was disappointed to see that Asian floating in the cabinet. The Aussie played a good villain, I loved it when he shot that handheld torpedo and sent that chick flipping off the bridge lol. The problem these days is they can't think of a great story to go with the great shark FX - just like The Shallows and 37 Metres Down are weak movies for teenage girls.
/m/deep_blue_sea_3	07cf774b-17b5-318e-b892-f87d5b9fcc44	0.5	waste of time. terrible acting
/m/deep_blue_sea_3	07cf774b-17b5-318e-b892-f87d5b9fcc44	2	Don’t make a deep blue sea 4. Make a new shark franchise. However this was way better than the sequel they attempted to make
/m/deep_blue_sea_3	07cf774b-17b5-318e-b892-f87d5b9fcc44	1	Another dumb shark copycat. Enough said.
/m/helmut_newton_the_bad_and_the_beautiful	d23a976a-dd79-429a-8cdf-41fd67bf8c5c	3.5	The main attraction here is the chance to look through all the Newton photography. There is some brief biographical material but it's mostly just candid interviews and scenes of him photographing models and visiting art galleries.
