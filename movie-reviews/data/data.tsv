/m/horror_noire_a_history_of_black_horror	45e2cd4d-e647-4045-bd1b-083f732cd428	4.5	A FASCINATING look into the history of black representation in horror films, from Night of Living Dead to Get Out- You see the cultural evolution in the progression of characters throughout the decades. Even past the history lesson, a BLAST to watch!
/m/horror_noire_a_history_of_black_horror	45e2cd4d-e647-4045-bd1b-083f732cd428	4.5	A really comprehensive look at the history of black people in and around horror films. And a reminder of several films I love and several more I never got around to watching ... which I will now.
/m/horror_noire_a_history_of_black_horror	45e2cd4d-e647-4045-bd1b-083f732cd428	3.5	Solid doc right here with a podcast to keep it goin'.
/m/horror_noire_a_history_of_black_horror	45e2cd4d-e647-4045-bd1b-083f732cd428	5	After decades of Hollywood abusing black people's images in horror movies and, therefore, legitimizing the real life horrors that still happen in this community, it's absolutely necessary to understand the roots of that, the development of the genre itself and the possibilities of horror films not only from a black perspective but in general, specially after 'Get Out'. Both the documentary and the book are necessary for any cinephile.
/m/horror_noire_a_history_of_black_horror	45e2cd4d-e647-4045-bd1b-083f732cd428	4	Very very informative thanks shudder .
/m/horror_noire_a_history_of_black_horror	45e2cd4d-e647-4045-bd1b-083f732cd428	4	Poderoso e interesantisimo documental de cine centrado en el viaje del hombre y mujer afroamericanos en el cine de genero. No solo aprenderas bastante sobre subgeneros como la blaxploitation, sino que descubriras muchas peliculas y pasaras un rato entretenido. Casi tan genial como Machete Maidens Unleashed.
/m/horror_noire_a_history_of_black_horror	45e2cd4d-e647-4045-bd1b-083f732cd428	3.5	this was really interesting; i recommend it if you're into documentaries, film making/history, or just horror movies in general.
/m/horror_noire_a_history_of_black_horror	45e2cd4d-e647-4045-bd1b-083f732cd428	5	It's an incredible documentary, an absolute must see. It's got loads of fantastic people from the horror industry exploring the history of black representation in cinema. There's no way to do it justice in a review, I'd give it all the stars in the universe as a rating if I could. It's fascinating and eye-opening, seriously just watch it, and read the book too, the book goes more in-depth but the doc has its incredible range of talent sharing their experiences as a viewer and as part of the history, it's got Tony Todd, Jordan Peele, Keith David and so so so many more, the doc also discusses the films that released after the book which when reading it, I was constantly wondering what Robin Coleman thought of recent films like Get Out.
/m/horror_noire_a_history_of_black_horror	45e2cd4d-e647-4045-bd1b-083f732cd428	5	I just watched #Horrornoire on Shudder.com, i really like this documentary because they showed the history of the negative sterotypes of black people and the positive impacts of their times. the 60's night of the living dead, 70s blacula, 80s nightmare on elm street, 90s the craft, candyman, tales from the hood, demonknight, etc, 2000s mentioning sanaa lathan avp was cool, 2010's get out the impact that movie had on the black community the documentary showed the relief of how black people felt from all the years of typical cliche in horror movies. So, if anyone is interested in black horror films, i suggest you this it is really good, makes want to write movies again, and educated on horror movies i never heard of and black directors too.
/m/the_capote_tapes	34865a7b-6d05-4138-8966-369463ad71f4	4	Flamboyant, openly gay author Truman Capote may not have been especially prolific, but he wrote several noteworthy, well-respected works. However, when excerpts of what was supposed to be his crowning achievement – the novel Answered Prayers about the dirty little secrets of New York high society based on the lives of a number of his "friends" – he became a pariah of sorts, losing contact with many of those close to him and triggering a speedy downward spiral in his health and well-being. In this new documentary, excerpts of recorded interviews with many of his friends and colleagues and new interviews with those who knew him and studied his work shed light on the enigmatic icon, his life and his writing, particularly with regard to his final and unfinished work. Included are archive segments featuring Lauren Bacall, Candice Bergen, George Plimpton, Norman Mailer, Lee Radziwill, Harper Lee, William F. Buckley and Capote's partner Jack Dunphy, along with new conversations with author Jay McInerney, journalist Sally Quinn, Vogue editor André Leon Talley and talk show host Dick Cavett, among others. Director Ebs Burnough's debut feature presents a captivating look at a talented, troubled and towering figure.
/m/blizzard_of_souls	3abdb18e-61ea-42bd-ba7f-35872557d02c	5	Quite exceptional, Even if the geopolitical side is little put forward, Blizzard of Souls exudes in an apparent simplicity a very great human force and brings its reflection on the absurdity of the war machine
/m/blizzard_of_souls	3abdb18e-61ea-42bd-ba7f-35872557d02c	3.5	A decent enough war movie that touches on all the inherent cliches.   Worth watching if for no other reason than there are so few WWI movies centered on the eastern front.
/m/blizzard_of_souls	3abdb18e-61ea-42bd-ba7f-35872557d02c	5	A cinematic masterpiece and the Oscar submission from the Baltic nation of Latvia, Blizzard of Souls will take you through a rollercoaster of emotions while providing you with a thorough history lesson! With echoes of 1917, Blizzard of Souls has masterful editing and cinematography, incredible sets and locations, and a talented cast, but falls a bit short on explaining major events in the First World War.   KULTFILMA took inspiration from true events and the novel by Grins to create Blizzard of Souls, which follows a teenage boy named Arturs Vanags in Russian-controlled Latvia (around the 1910s). Arturs' father was a highly decorated commander of a regiment of the Latvian army, and his brother Edgars is focused on carrying on that legacy. He's not exactly a fighter, but when his mother is killed by the Germans, Arturs, his brother, and his father conscript in the national Latvian Riflemen battalions of the Imperial Russian army in hopes of getting revenge and finding glory. He experiences many loves and losses in battle, after which he, among other soldiers, grows weary of the Tsarist cause and feels forgotten. Arturs must decide whether to stay with his regiment or defect and join his comrades in fighting the Latvian War of Independence and start his life all over again. As you can see, there's a lot happening in the film, and it's an intriguing plotline. Though I am a history buff, I'm not at the top of my game when it comes to Latvian war history, so I was really hoping for some time or battle markers; all of the battles seemed to blend together, save for the final conflict Arturs is involved in - the Battle of Cesis.   The cast and crew shine in this Baltic beauty. Oto Brantevics and Raimonds Celms play the brothers Vanags, with Oto as Arturs and Raimonds as Edgars. Raimond is a more experienced actor, but Oto really shines in his performance, with perfectly toned emotions and dialogue. Their on-screen father is played by Martins Vilsons, whose cerebral, tough personality gives way (at the perfect time) to paternal love. And the Vanags' friends in the film, Mikelsons and Konrads, are played by Jēkabs Reinis and Gatis Gaga, who excel in their supporting roles with pointed humor and emulating the characters' focused, yet free personalities. Behind the scenes, Dzintars Dreibergs directed the film meticulously, with a keen eye on historical accuracy and believability. The music in the film, which majestically introduces and drives the action in each scene, was composed by Lolita Ritmanis. The soundtrack is definitely one of my favorite parts of the film. Another beautiful element of Blizzard of Souls is the cinematography by Valdis Celmiņš; viewers can tell that each shot was thoughtfully planned out. There is a large part of one battle sequence that was shot and edited in one take, which really helps the speed of the film.   The message of Blizzard of Souls is one of growth; Arturs grows from a young boy to a mature hero throughout this film and has to make many tough decisions along the way. It's a positive and relatable message, as we all grow as people throughout our lives. There are some scenes for parents to watch out for though; there's a lot of blood and gore, some nudity and profanity (given the culture of trench warfare).   I give Blizzard of Souls 5 stars out of 5 and recommend it for ages 14 to 18. Adults will enjoy this film as well.
/m/blizzard_of_souls	3abdb18e-61ea-42bd-ba7f-35872557d02c	5	Amazing! So personal and respectful war story. Just must see! If this is not getting Oscars then I dont know movies.
/m/beans_2021	d6f76647-7cf1-35b9-bd4e-ef5485113c87	5	Amazing writing and acting especially by the young woman playing Beans.
/m/the_estate_2021	5ef6747e-ee54-48cc-b8b2-7e155e66e56e	1	Amateurish and filled with reality show characters you wouldn't want to spend a minute with.
/m/the_estate_2021	5ef6747e-ee54-48cc-b8b2-7e155e66e56e	3.5	Some great laugh out loud moments to be had from this camp, crime caper. It's silly, it's saucy, it's good fun.
/m/the_estate_2021	5ef6747e-ee54-48cc-b8b2-7e155e66e56e	5	Campy, fun, witty, and sexy! Baker is magnetic, the lines are laugh out loud funny, and it doesn't take itself too seriously, which is makes it all the more compelling and refreshing to watch. Had so much fun watching it!
/m/the_estate_2021	5ef6747e-ee54-48cc-b8b2-7e155e66e56e	4	Delicious! Unflinching and fresh, with full-throttle performances by the cast, and propelled by a witty, smart script. This was a lot of fun and a standout from the pack.
/m/the_estate_2021	5ef6747e-ee54-48cc-b8b2-7e155e66e56e	4	If you like a good campy movie - look no further! I loved seeing Chris Baker (who also wrote the film) in the starring role. Multi-talented and so fun. The story itself had a crazy twist I didn't see coming so that's always a welcome surprise when I'm having fun cackling at funny lines and gorgeous people. Eliza Coupe is always brilliant in whatever she does, comedy queen. I caught it via Vudu which was so easy and accessible (and closed captioned too!)
/m/the_estate_2021	5ef6747e-ee54-48cc-b8b2-7e155e66e56e	5	I really loved this movie. It really surprised me! It was so much fun to watch, really bold and splashy, laugh-out-loud funny, and supremely entertaining. And truly unique -- I can't say that I've ever seen a film quite like it before. Ryan Murphy could never! I devoured The Estate, and then I watched it again. Recommend you do the same!
/m/the_estate_2021	5ef6747e-ee54-48cc-b8b2-7e155e66e56e	5	I saw this film in theaters. New York Matinee called it a playful, but mysterious little dish. You'll love it.
/m/the_estate_2021	5ef6747e-ee54-48cc-b8b2-7e155e66e56e	5	Saw the movie on demand and loved it! The characters hilariously evil and real. Eliza Coupe and Chris Baker are incredible.
/m/the_estate_2021	5ef6747e-ee54-48cc-b8b2-7e155e66e56e	5	I saw The Estate in theaters and it was amazing! It had just the right mix of comedy, suspense, and horror. I never knew what was coming next. The actors were so matched to their roles and really gave you a sense of their characters, their desires, and who they were right from the start. I couldn't recommend it enough, a must-see!
/m/knocking_2021	b0ae31e6-dbf5-47e6-a439-0b4c24e25c78	4.5	It's a slow-burn, but I love that kind of atmospheric insidiousness, and this nails that.
/m/knocking_2021	b0ae31e6-dbf5-47e6-a439-0b4c24e25c78	3.5	Whilst Knocking's vessel for horror is in its psychological presence of grief, which will surely not be for everyone's pallet; it is still a traumatic and effective portrayal in paranoia and trauma with a lingering eeriness. It's a smart and discomforting experience, one you can't knock until you try it.
/m/bergman_island_2021	a98891f1-6003-476d-a939-9e02042ae275	3	Beautiful setting and a story that only gets interesting when Mia gets on the screen. You will need patience to watch it. Sometimes the movie gets boring but then it gets beautiful again.
/m/bergman_island_2021	a98891f1-6003-476d-a939-9e02042ae275	1.5	Boring pretentious claptrap that makes Bergman films look scintillating. Don't waste your time. The scenery is the best thing.
/m/bergman_island_2021	a98891f1-6003-476d-a939-9e02042ae275	4	Bergman Island is a fascinating meta drama. Vicky Krieps and Tim Roth were both great. The standout has gotta be Mia Wasikowska. She was excellent, and delivered a truly memorable performance. The screenplay was a highlight. I liked the Ingmar Bergman references (which there were probably many I didn’t get), and I loved the film within the film. Everything involving Wasikowska worked wonders with me. All of the other stuff was still great though. Overall, I had a great time with this. This was my first film from Mia Hansen-Løve and I hope to see more in the future.
/m/the_blazing_world_2021	7dc3118a-dc5e-44be-b993-a7fdab3475a7	3	Visually stunning with a great eery score . As far as a directorial debut I think Carlson has an incredible career ahead of herself . 3/5
/m/the_blazing_world_2021	7dc3118a-dc5e-44be-b993-a7fdab3475a7	3.5	Films like this are for a select niche group movie-goers.  I love these psychological plots. The sound, colors, the art and the metaphoric symbolism were decent in it.  The story i had to watch twice though to really grasp. Story is decent but I've seen better. You'll either enjoy it or You'll hate it.   Its a select genre.
/m/the_blazing_world_2021	7dc3118a-dc5e-44be-b993-a7fdab3475a7	4.5	5 stars for originality , style and atmosphere. Though not quite there, Young has all the makings of a modern horror maestro, a la Peele. This almost felt like it could have been the 5th season of Channel Zero (a good thing). This is a very original script and I cannot wait to see what comes out of her mind in the future.
/m/broadcast_signal_intrusion	3163a3cf-148c-3303-8a70-551f648cf9f3	0.5	One of the worst written movie scripts ever. It had such potential, but none of it flowed in the end. It was more horror than suspense. I'm so glad we streamed for free!
/m/broadcast_signal_intrusion	3163a3cf-148c-3303-8a70-551f648cf9f3	3	3.0. A nice little hacker noir
/m/the_spine_of_night	f00f8c04-f1e5-4b97-8474-869760157866	3.5	an original story well executed
/m/the_spine_of_night	f00f8c04-f1e5-4b97-8474-869760157866	5	Trippy, bloody, and completely mind blowing fantasy. Loved it
/m/the_spine_of_night	f00f8c04-f1e5-4b97-8474-869760157866	5	Unhinged? Sure. Non-linear? Yes. But unlike any movie that’s going to be in theaters this year, or maybe any year! Do yourself a favor and if you’ve been complaining about how all movies are the same these days…go see this. A wicked meditation on knowledge, power, psychedelics, and nihilism, all while also being what the New York Times described as “mostly a history of disembowelment.” I know that was supposed to be a bad review, but honestly it just made me want to see it! The movie plays out as interlinked short stories over…mostly hundreds of years? With one mythological flashback. I found that segment, the ur-mythical killing of the gods to be particularly powerful and visually compelling, and it just paired perfectly with Richard Grant’s arch reading. Beautiful. If for nothing else, go see it for that segment alone.
/m/the_spine_of_night	f00f8c04-f1e5-4b97-8474-869760157866	5	Obviously, I think it's extremely rad.
/m/the_spine_of_night	f00f8c04-f1e5-4b97-8474-869760157866	2.5	I appreciate it on some level, but it's a "miss" and disappointment since I actually had some expectations. They nailed the animation style, and the story was "ok", just "ok"... but the characters and style choices were just not "cool", and for a movie like this the "cool" factor needs be high and it just wasn't there. If anything I'd call it "weak" and at times just "lame". Pretty disappointing. Oh well... can always watch Wizards, Fire & Ice, LoTR if I want the "real" thing.
/m/the_spine_of_night	f00f8c04-f1e5-4b97-8474-869760157866	3	It aspires to the greatness of Heavy Metal and Fire & Ice, but comes up short in both cases. The rotoscope is weak, the story slow and meandering, and ultimately it adds very little to the world of fantasy animation.
/m/the_beta_test	a42cecf3-f6bd-4a69-ad3b-2e04996cbc23	1	Jim Cummings just seems like a studio assistant who wants to be an actor but really shouldn't, no.
/m/the_beta_test	a42cecf3-f6bd-4a69-ad3b-2e04996cbc23	1.5	Why is this so highly rated? It looked and felt like a student film. Super disappointing.
/m/the_beta_test	a42cecf3-f6bd-4a69-ad3b-2e04996cbc23	5	Jimmy C is amazing, story and cast are amazing. Just go watch and see
/m/the_beta_test	a42cecf3-f6bd-4a69-ad3b-2e04996cbc23	4	The Beta Test is a captivating satirical thriller. I’ve been a big fan of Jim Cummings with Thunder Road and The Wolf of Snow Hollow. And I’m glad to say his hot streak continues. Acting wise he was great yet again. He collaborates with PJ McCabe for directing and writing duties, and they both kill it. The comedy works and the mystery is engrossing. The film hooks you right from the start and consistently keeps you engaged. Overall, I had a great time with this. Jim Cummings continues to be one of the top indie directors out there, and I look forward to whatever his next film is.
/m/the_beta_test	a42cecf3-f6bd-4a69-ad3b-2e04996cbc23	2.5	The message this movie is trying to tell by vilifying and make you scared about sharing your personal information on the internet, fell completely flat, the message not the movie, the movie is interesting, the most unsettling part of the movie is the main character himself and the creatures that inhabits, to be fair our world, but not to the extent it is portrayed in the movie, also ever heard of Tinder.
/m/the_beta_test	a42cecf3-f6bd-4a69-ad3b-2e04996cbc23	5	Wow. Just Wow. Chilling social commentary and a stunning performance by Jim Cummings, who, I just found out, also co-wrote and directed.
/m/the_beta_test	a42cecf3-f6bd-4a69-ad3b-2e04996cbc23	0.5	a total waste of time.  ending did not help an awful story.  i  did not find it funny, just boring.    in short,  i did not like it,  story make no sense.
/m/tango_shalom	dab2d73e-0835-4932-b0c9-4bd3b7ae292e	4	This movie has an incredible amount of heart... it shows the similarity between the world's top religions as well as showing the importance of following your Dreams, and finding a way to have them come true against all odds!  A truly enjoyable movie for anyone who wants an affirmation that there it still good and love in the world. Don't miss "Tango Shalom", You owe it to yourself to see this movie !!!
/m/tango_shalom	dab2d73e-0835-4932-b0c9-4bd3b7ae292e	5	I Haven't been to the movies in a very long time and what a great movie to get me going back. "Tango Shalom" is hilariously funny with an array of loveable characters. I love Renee Taylor from the "Nanny" making me laugh every moment she is on the screen and Karina Smirnoff of "Dancing With the Stars" for her dazzling dancing and lovely acting ability. Jos Laniado was excellent in his lead role. I loved them all. This movie also proved you can make a great entertaining movie without violence or vulgar language. Go see it!!! you won't be sorry.
/m/tango_shalom	dab2d73e-0835-4932-b0c9-4bd3b7ae292e	5	This movie surprised me. It was so much more than I expected. I am not Jewish. I don't watch Dancing With The Stars. But I loved this movie. The cast was superb and the movie held my attention from beginning to end. If you are looking for a great story with a good amount of laughs, this is the movie to see. I could mention the cast one by one but they were all terrific. However, as a fan of The Nanny, I am going to single out Renee Taylor. She was hilarious throughout the entire film. I highly recommend this movie. You will not be disappointed !
/m/tango_shalom	dab2d73e-0835-4932-b0c9-4bd3b7ae292e	5	Tango Shalom is just what the doctor ordered, a light hearted movie  with a great story that brings people together instead of dividing them.
/m/tango_shalom	dab2d73e-0835-4932-b0c9-4bd3b7ae292e	5	Refreshingly entertaining, original storyline, great cast with some wonderful recognizable faces such as Renée Taylor, Joe Bologna and Lainie Kazan. And for those of you who are "Dancing with the Stars" fans, Karina Smirnoff has one of the lead roles and is sizzling. I believe people from all walks of life will enjoy this film. Along with many hilarious and touching moments, it has a beautiful message, and the dance contest at the end will have you at the edge of your seat. We need more movies like this!!!!!
/m/tango_shalom	dab2d73e-0835-4932-b0c9-4bd3b7ae292e	5	I thought the film overall was inspiring and I love the message that you can always find a way to do what you love without having to lose who you are. The balloon dance was so thrilling!!
/m/tango_shalom	dab2d73e-0835-4932-b0c9-4bd3b7ae292e	5	We loved this movie.  It reminded us of the way we grew up, the expressions, as well as relevant to todays world.  We recommend this to everyone!!!
/m/tango_shalom	dab2d73e-0835-4932-b0c9-4bd3b7ae292e	4.5	I thought this movie made some great points about religious differences and that maybe there are only cultural differences.  The actors and actresses were outstanding in their performances.  Most New Yorkers would recognize 90% of the Yiddish used.  The concept of using a balloon to keep the dancers separated was absolutely brilliant.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would even go to see it again!
/m/tango_shalom	dab2d73e-0835-4932-b0c9-4bd3b7ae292e	5	I loved this movie so much ! I loved all the performances- they were full of Heart and fun and passion! It made me so happy I just sat in the theater and never wanted to leave! For me this is why we go to the theatre and see a movie - it was sheer divinity- and perfect in every way! Loved it ! Congratulations to everyone invoked in making this 💎 gem! Bravo!!!
/m/tango_shalom	dab2d73e-0835-4932-b0c9-4bd3b7ae292e	4	Very adorable movie. Great plot line. I would have liked more show of dancing between the Rabbi and the Karina. It only showed parts of footwork and body lines. Otherwise, I enjoyed the movie very much.
/m/mark_mary_and_some_other_people	0f2a8ce6-4d56-443c-9b47-d3d8892c5a11	2	Mark, Mary & Some Other People should have left the second half of its title away from its plot, because where the first half of the movie generally has some charm and energy, when everything gets shaken up it falls flat on its face. When the character´s of the movie don´t find the relationship interesting enough to care more for each other, why should the viewer thinks otherwise ?
/m/after_we_fell	f854e7c0-1580-351e-8304-39d9fe5c1491	2	It was depressing and boring watching the same old same old. it wasn't until the very end when I started getting interesting
/m/after_we_fell	f854e7c0-1580-351e-8304-39d9fe5c1491	1.5	Really disappointed that a film/book series with so many followers would have so many actor changes. Hero and Josephine have zero chemistry in this film. This film should have been at least 2 hours. It was rushed and jumbled up and didn't make any sense. Very disappointed with this.
/m/after_we_fell	f854e7c0-1580-351e-8304-39d9fe5c1491	0.5	After We Fell shows the subtle art of boring audiences worldwide while bringing absolutely nothing new to the table, making for a new low in the already comicly bad After franchise. Props to Langford and Fiennes-Tiffin for being able to hold back their laughter throughout their idiotic dialogues.
/m/after_we_fell	f854e7c0-1580-351e-8304-39d9fe5c1491	0.5	Very cliche and cringey. Like reallyyyyyyyy cringey. I laughed when I shouldn't off
/m/after_we_fell	f854e7c0-1580-351e-8304-39d9fe5c1491	0.5	I swear as the series goes on, the movies get more boring and dull. If you read the books and enjoy them, just stick to the books; the movies don't do them nearly enough justice. 😕
/m/after_we_fell	f854e7c0-1580-351e-8304-39d9fe5c1491	2.5	Definitely see this as a joining movie for the last one to come. So many good scenes from the books that were skipped out and I feel it was a very flat movie lacking in music and dialogue. It wasn't terrible but it could have been better. Nothing against the two main actors/actresses.
/m/after_we_fell	f854e7c0-1580-351e-8304-39d9fe5c1491	1.5	I understand that story lines have to be altered when filming a movie from a book, but to remove key points in the story line, and end the movie for people who have read the books, with the complete opposite of what actually happens, I feel is actually an insult to Anna Todd. There was no kissy make up in the streets of London, Tessa left, without Hardin in the real story. Where is Zed? He was an integral part of this story line. Where is Lilian's Family? Lilian meets Hardin for the First time, they weren't "Friends". I had High hopes for this third installment of the After Series, but this was an absolute let down. Plus the R rated scenes are abysmal. Yeah the idea is raunchy, but there is really no substance to those scenes which are an integral part of the story line. Highly disappointed with the Gym scene, if I'm being honest. If Series could be made instead of Movies which drastically alter the  story line to make up their own PG, Family friendly story lines, then I think these Books to Screen adaptations would be a lot better received.
/m/after_we_fell	f854e7c0-1580-351e-8304-39d9fe5c1491	0.5	(WARNING SPOLIERS FROM THE BOOKS)  Terrible movie. The writers and director said the third movie was true to the books which is a lie. The third book was SO good but they left almost everything out of it and the stuff that was in the movie was wrong and didn't match the book at all. They left out how Tessa was seeing Zed. After running into her father in the second movie she starts to build a relationship with him before she moves to Seattle. After that he shows up to Hardin's apartment sick from detoxing and Hardin takes care of him while he is getting sober. Then one of his drug dealers shows up demanding money from Tessa's father but he doesn't have it so Hardin has to give him his watch that his Father got him for Christmas. After Tessa finds out she could never have children of her own she gets drunk one night and calls Hardin and is a mess and Hardin gets so scared he is rushing up there crying to make sure she doesn't hurt herself because Kimberly and Vance isn't home with her and he can't get ahold of Tessa. There is also alot more sex between the two of them and the hot tub scene isn't like that they are alone because everyone went up the road to Hardin's father friends cabin so Hardin has to talk Tessa into getting into the hot tub nude then half way into having sex Hardin freaks out because he doesn't have a condom on and flips out on Tessa and accuses her of trying to trap him. There is also a part where Tessa gets roofied at her going away party and almost gets raped and Zed takes her to her mother's house which isn't in the movies either because they left everyone else out of the movies but Tessa Hardin the main characters and a few of their friends and family. There is so much more to the books they left out. The scene where Hardin learns about who his real father is that isn't how it is in the books either all completely wrong and Tessa and Hardin DEFINITELY DO NOT find each other afterwards in the middle of the dang road. All of this is absolutely trash. They should just fire all the cast but the actors who play Hardin and Tessa and start from the beginning instead of what they have been doing and just throwing scenes together that don't even go together at all. I'm sure alot of the After true fans of the books feel the same way.
/m/after_we_fell	f854e7c0-1580-351e-8304-39d9fe5c1491	3.5	It's now fully a series and worth following!
/m/after_we_fell	f854e7c0-1580-351e-8304-39d9fe5c1491	0.5	10 minutes into this movie and I am already annoyed. I was deeply invested in this book series and really loved it. The first movie was actually quite great. Moving into the second and third movie I hate the inconsistency of characters. Every movie the main characters are different and many key details are missed or changed. Disappointed
/m/finding_kendrick_johnson	882482d6-9513-37c0-866e-b51566d381f0	5	One of the most tragic, heartbreaking stories of our time. The amount of coverups within the GBI, FBI, and justice system is beyond words. This is a must-watch for everyone. #JusticeforKendrickJohnson

I was lucky enough to see the original show at Largo and now again to see them present it at Largo. The crowd roared with laughter at the movie as did I.

/m/warning_2021	23ea7b85-3622-3630-9be2-53c3316afe36	1.5	Small ideas, limited execution
/m/warning_2021	23ea7b85-3622-3630-9be2-53c3316afe36	2	As has already been said several times, it's a compilation of 'Black Mirror' type shorts.  Some are insightful. Some are terrible. None are great. The only thread tying them all together is a silly astronaut that deserved to die by spacewalking without being anchored or tethered to what he was working on and is blown free of his grip by an unknown force.  He floats and bitches to God for his bad luck and slow death while watching as a mysterious lightning-lit "space cloud" slowly approaches earth.  Painfully serving as an apparition of destruction of ourselves as it releases several comets/asteroids from its mist. The reason or method why is up to the audience to figure out.
/m/warning_2021	23ea7b85-3622-3630-9be2-53c3316afe36	5	Intense sci-fi thriller with a lot to offer the audiences. They got the right people for the film which is a good thing and that ending caught me of guard. I'm usually good at predicting what might happen next in movies but this one has plenty of plot twists you would not expect. There's many stories in this film so pay attention or you might have to watch it the second time - perfectly crafted in my opinion.
/m/warning_2021	23ea7b85-3622-3630-9be2-53c3316afe36	4	A refreshing change from typical sci-fi with this arthouse science fiction film. I wanted to like it more, but the writing by the three writers was muddled, convoluted, not cohesive enough, and had plot and technical issues. The concept of the film was refreshingly unique - sort of an intertwining of a bunch of Black Mirror episodes. I'm not sure if the stories were split amongst the writers, but I felt some were much better than others. Even the intertwining of the stories could've been executed much better.  However, Agata Alexander's directing and camera work was excellent. She captured the real essence of many scenes with her exceptional choice of shots and angles. The cinematography was spot-on, and the casting and performances were on point. Many of the sets were amazing and showed a decent variety of class vs technology. The 85 min runtime and pacing were proper, but I would've liked another 15-20 mins added to elevate some of the stories and their characters - this coming from someone who is not a fan of anything longer than 90 mins.  Nevertheless I still enjoyed this untypical sci-fi, and considering this is writer and director Agata Alexander's first film debut as a filmmaker (only prior experience are music videos), she did better than some seasoned filmmakers work I've seen lately. Would I recommend it? If you are into tech, sci-fi and enjoy arthouse films, absolutely. Would I see it again? Yes, especially now that I know what's going on and what to look for. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me.
/m/warning_2021	23ea7b85-3622-3630-9be2-53c3316afe36	4	Such an entertaining film. Not sure why the critics are harsh but the storyline is an interesting take on AI. The film is nicely edited too, all the mini plots led up to the final ending. I'll giving this a 4
/m/warning_2021	23ea7b85-3622-3630-9be2-53c3316afe36	0.5	I wanted to hang myself within 105 seconds with so many production companies involved. I'm sorry I tried to get through the movie. A total waste of time. As the other reviews say, there are some interesting ideas, but just an incomplete and awful POS.  Thomas Jane mumbling his way through his lines are of particular annoyance as usual as well.
/m/warning_2021	23ea7b85-3622-3630-9be2-53c3316afe36	5	If you like black mirror and sci-fi then you'll love this. It's made on an indie budget even though they got some really famous faces on here but they honestly made it work. It's a watch from me!
/m/warning_2021	23ea7b85-3622-3630-9be2-53c3316afe36	5	Impressive plot. It really does spark the topic and thoughts of the meaning of life. The editing was great too... crafted well with stories that all take place in the same universe at the same time. This isn't your typical Hollywood film so have an open mind when watching this.
/m/warning_2021	23ea7b85-3622-3630-9be2-53c3316afe36	5	If you like shows with future tech, you'll enjoy this. Plus if your not offended by jokes about religion, some parts are pleasantly hilarious to watch.  Just be warned, the thriller parts are a truly disturbing/horrific glimpses into possible futures. The ending pretty much sums up our futures, in one perfect line by the protagonist.
/m/runt_2021	579cf86e-b12b-331b-8925-8ff5654030c5	2.5	Runt (rental) is a quasi-parable about the escalating nature of violence, but an undercooked screenplay leaves it feeling like a malformed after school special.  Camron Boyce shows real talent and it is a shame that this is his last film (he died form complications of epilepsy shortly after the film was made.)
/m/runt_2021	579cf86e-b12b-331b-8925-8ff5654030c5	1.5	So many played-out first-project indie film tropes in one movie--nobody should have let Disney Channel cutie Cameron Boyce attempt something requiring authentic emotional depth.  It's surprisingly not the first writing effort of Christian van Gregg--whose only other credit is the similarly horribly-rated "Septem8er Tapes" over 15 years ago.  Redeeming qualities include the dog, a guest appearance of Marie Antoinette as Cal's mom, and the music/score (which is of noticeably higher quality/production value than most truly indie films).
/m/runt_2021	579cf86e-b12b-331b-8925-8ff5654030c5	1	The lead is far too lightweight and amateurish to carry this film.
/m/runt_2021	579cf86e-b12b-331b-8925-8ff5654030c5	0.5	It is very sad that Boyce died, I do believe he had potential to be a great actor, however I have to be honest and say that this film was a complete waste of time. It was completely cliche in every sense, and offered none of the twists that would have made it special. The acting with the exception of Boyce is just terrible... I mean it's the type of bad where it's obvious that these are people acting. So many ways this could have been better, but acting aside couldn't it have been Cecily to kill Runt? That way "Cal" takes revenge thinking it's the football guys that everyone thinks it would be? The protagonist "Cal" is culpable in the sense that his sins often exceed those of those who are supposed to be the antagonists... Like a bike chain? Really? That's what sent you over the edge dude? IT wasn't like that previous incident where "Vic" goes full Donald Trump on your girl?  Christ, this movie was Rotten. What an awful bookend to what could have been this young man's future legacy.
/m/dashcam_2021	de4cad3c-024d-38f2-88f6-e000d88e5c14	2	I struggled with this. Because for the most part it's people having online video calls, the video & sound quality is low. Plus, 1/3 of the screen is the character and the other 2/3 is the computer's wallpaper. Which made it quite unwatchable. Added to that, much of it felt like an advert for Adobe Premiere, whilst watching someone edit. Which is horribly tedious.  And to cap it all, I don't think the story was strong enough.  Avoid.
/m/dashcam_2021	de4cad3c-024d-38f2-88f6-e000d88e5c14	4	Underrated movie for sure. The plot was really good and kept getting better the more the movie went on. There were times the acting could've been a little more impressive and it's easy to tell this was a pretty low budget film, but for what they had it was executed very well. The ending is my biggest complaint, as it left me very dissatisfied. If I were the creators of this film, I would've upped the budget, left it off with a cliff hanger and made a sequel. I'm glad this is the movie I chose to watch this Halloween night, and I'd highly consider recommending this to others.
/m/dashcam_2021	de4cad3c-024d-38f2-88f6-e000d88e5c14	5	Amazing movie  eric tabach is amazing
/m/dashcam_2021	de4cad3c-024d-38f2-88f6-e000d88e5c14	4.5	Like most reviewers, I watched the wrong DASHCAM. That said, this film was great! To be honest, it's better than I expected the other one to be. I think some people are hating because they made a mistake. This was a tight, fun, little thriller. Small budget, obviously, but a really nice film. I recommend.
/m/dashcam_2021	de4cad3c-024d-38f2-88f6-e000d88e5c14	5	Great movie! I really enjoyed watching.
/m/dashcam_2021	de4cad3c-024d-38f2-88f6-e000d88e5c14	2.5	An intriguing concept that could have been so, so, so much more if only it had a more competent screenwriter. (Spoilers: Would ANYONE in that situation not *immediately* know to at the very least cover up your webcam, make an encrypted backup (or several!) of the original leaked Police Report contents AND IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOUR APARTMENT IMMEDIATELY AFTER RECEIVING THE LEAKED DIGITAL FILE, WHY NOT USE A VPN AND DO NOT USE YOUR CELL PHONE OR YOUR THE CELL PHONE ACCOUNT YOUR COMPUTER IS LINKED TO??  Seriously, this movie could have been so much more fun & exciting, but after the first 15 minutes we figure out that the screenwriter wasn't interested in trying to take this narrative premise as seriously as say, Brian De Palma once did when he *literally made the same exact film but in a way that was both stylistically head & shoulders above this one – not to mention De Palma approached the premise with so much attention to detail, always leaning into the most banal minutiae associated with the work of an editor.   By the way, the film I'm referring to is 1982's, "Blow Out." A film that I actually re-watched just a few months ago & was utterly shocked at how well it's held up over the last ~30 years. "Blow Out" also boasts a performance by John Travolta that Quentin Tarantino has never once wavered in his labeling of it as, "One of the greatest performances of all time in the history of cinema," (a statement he stood by years before he'd even written the screenplay for Reservoir Dogs & one that he continues to stand by to this very day; if that isn't high enough praise or enough incentive for you to go watch "Blow Out" already, then I guess there's just nothing to be done. For those of you looking for a masterpiece of a film that you've likely never heard of – of perhaps heard of but never got around to watching – trust Tarantino, and believe in me when I say that it is the movie you want to watch instead of "Dashcam." I cannot put it any more plainly than that. Happy viewing.
/m/dashcam_2021	de4cad3c-024d-38f2-88f6-e000d88e5c14	4.5	An incredibly inventive take on screenlife movies. I was so immersed in Jake's story, it almost felt like a meditation. We need more movies like this. Simple yet thrilling.
/m/dangerous	00f08390-1ee4-3f4c-b887-31c9803fed0c	0.5	1 out of 10. An amazingly terrible movie. It reminded me of a bad episode of a 70s B grade TV show.
/m/dangerous	00f08390-1ee4-3f4c-b887-31c9803fed0c	4.5	We liked it! Fun popcorn flick on a Saturday Night!
/m/dangerous	00f08390-1ee4-3f4c-b887-31c9803fed0c	4.5	First time seeing Scott Eastwood in a movie. My take? Amazing actor and highly underrated. This was a super entertaining movie!! Had it not been on DirecTV, this should have been in theaters. I enjoyed this 1000% more than Eternals - and the script and acting were 1000% better in this movie too. Great movie! You will be entertained.
/m/dangerous	00f08390-1ee4-3f4c-b887-31c9803fed0c	0.5	OMG! Worst movie of 2021. Horrid nonsensical dialog, terrible acting, what was Scott Eastwood thinking?
/m/dangerous	00f08390-1ee4-3f4c-b887-31c9803fed0c	2.5	nice idea, acting nice character development .. meh plot and meh writing in general
/m/dangerous	00f08390-1ee4-3f4c-b887-31c9803fed0c	4.5	I have discovered that when R.T. critics don't like a movie that 90% of the time I really like or love that movie. Our entertainment taste are extremely different. Additionally, over the years, movies they have reviewed as BAD go on to be top box office and/or audience favorites. DANGEROUS is a entertaining movie. Has a lot of action, and a good plot, lots of humour and Mel Gibson's scenes will have you laughing out loud. The movie does take about 8 minutes to get going.
/m/dangerous	00f08390-1ee4-3f4c-b887-31c9803fed0c	3.5	I enjoyed it, but it could've easily been so much better. I'd call this one of the much better B films I've seen lately, but it's too bad the novice filmmakers didn't put in more effort that could've elevated this to A film status.  Production designer turned novice producer and director David Hackl chose to focus more on cliches and directed his cast to play dumb in attempting humor. We're all tired of the cliched funny looking loud redneck bad guy. Then having Kevin Durand's talent wasted posing as a cliched Dr. Evil and being lost in his duties was cringe. Even Scott Eastwood's character was poorly directed, but luckily his character was elevated with Mel Gibson's character as their dynamics was hilarious. I felt that dynamic was underutilized. Even the rest of the cast were poorly directed and looked lost for the most part.  Then we have newb writer Christopher Borrelli who actually came up with a nice story with great twists and turns, but the execution was lacklustre. Had a seasoned writer looked over the script, I'm sure there'd be changes to elevate the screenplay. At 99 min long, it felt longer with many long dragged out and unnecessary scenes - and characters. The pacing was also slow and dragging. What even was the point of having Tyrese Gibson and Famke Janssen's character written in, when they were just unnecessary filler with little to no character development. The screenplay needed about 15 mins of fluff omitted, and another 30 mins added in utilizing Gibson and Janssen's character better, as well as making Eastwood's one-man-army character much more exciting. Or omit Gibson and Janssen's character all together.  But in general, the casting was great, and Mel Gibson shined (and was hilarious), but most of the leads were so underused, it felt they were only cast to add value to the film. The score was actually on point, especially for a B film, and the cinematography decent. The underground set and hidden entry they created was actually quite awesome. You wont see that one coming.  I feel if the directing and writing of the characters had been more serious - instead of acting like cartoon dummy bad guys, this film could've been a hit. It felt lost trying to decide if it's an action film (of which any little action was boring), or a dark comedy thriller, that was riddled with cliches.  Nevertheless, I saw it to the end, and actually enjoyed it - albeit noticing the small details that could've elevated this production to another level. For the novice filmmakers, I feel it's still a win, because I've seen some terrible films from seasoned filmmakers lately. Thus it's deserving of my 7/10.
/m/dangerous	00f08390-1ee4-3f4c-b887-31c9803fed0c	5	The movie is pretty okay.
/m/night_at_the_eagle_inn	def47e48-a5a3-3c42-bbce-83f34762f978	5	I absolutely loved it! So damn much to like here its silly. Enjoy!
/m/one_shot_2021	2e92c9d1-4e8d-3e09-a6bc-f18a1c91e48c	3.5	While not a must-see, casual and even die-hard action fans will find One Shot a competent little gem of a film, aided by its technical ingenuity, electric gunplay and stellar fight choreography. This also happens to be one of Adkins's best roles and performances.
/m/outlier_2021	bfea5ada-5a58-3cf2-bc13-8d1acf357300	4	One of the most exciting quarantine projects out there!  In a year surrounded by projects like Demonic and Malcolm & Marie, Hollywood's newest subgenre of films are made on a limited scope during the height of the global pandemic— it's no surprise to me the best one I've seen comes from a team of talented young filmmakers.  The directorial debut from Nate Strayer leaves little to be desired. For a film of its budget, the movie is extremely well-paced and unravels a simple premise into a complex and layered psychological thriller.  The standout for me was the cinematography, with two credited DPs, you'd think there'd be a more drastic shift from scene to scene. But what we get with Outlier is an extremely intentional, motivated shot composition that kept me on the edge of my seat.  One part domestic thriller and another part tense drama, this film will grab your interest and take it on a magic carpet ride through the third act.  I cannot wait to see what the crew of this movie moves on to make next. Personally knowing and attending school with some of them, I got to watch the "making of" through Instagram stories and Facebook posts.   Strayer especially demonstrates what marketing a movie looks like for the next generation of filmmakers. He and the crew should be extremely proud of this productive effort in a year where making a debut feature seemed impossible.  The film also has very compelling sound design and an engaging score that accommodates the tense visuals.   Into my criticism, in a script this tight, I would have preferred more sense of levity and ease before shit hit the fan. I got to know the main characters fears and doubts before I got to know their personalities, perhaps that's by design!   This movie is without a doubt worth the price of a rental. Give it a watch— this team is going somewhere!
/m/outlier_2021	bfea5ada-5a58-3cf2-bc13-8d1acf357300	5	Cannot believe this is Strayer's first feature film! It's a gripping/intense thriller that definitely brings a classic feel into play. Would highly recommend checking this film out if you like a less violent but mentally thrilling film...
/m/outlier_2021	bfea5ada-5a58-3cf2-bc13-8d1acf357300	4	An exciting director to watch out for! Nate Strayer's first feature shows a deep understanding of storytelling. Circular arcs of some characters and matching shots where's character roles have been switched Nate's writing is impressive in the details of a motion picture. It is thrilling and delivers some chilling visuals. Even more impressive is the size of the crew… which was insanely small in pulling off a feat such as this. Watching the film you would never know.  The cinematography is quite stunning at times and the film really takes advantage of beautiful locations. Much like the director I see this cinematographer as something very exciting to watch out for as well!
/m/outlier_2021	bfea5ada-5a58-3cf2-bc13-8d1acf357300	0.5	The worst movie with a decent plot. HORRIBLE acting. The female spends the movie in fake weird face contortions and with her mouth oddly open. The male character is monotone and underdeveloped. Waste of 2 hours. Disappointed.
/m/outlier_2021	bfea5ada-5a58-3cf2-bc13-8d1acf357300	3.5	I think Anton Bitel did the best review of the critics, not sure what he scored it but I believe it's worth a watch if you're on the look out for upcoming directors. It's in the strange subgenre that emerged during Covid of "Lockdown films" and with that context it did it's job.
/m/outlier_2021	bfea5ada-5a58-3cf2-bc13-8d1acf357300	1	Horrible acting, very boring start. Not sure how people enjoy this movie. Its corny, again horrible acting to the point where Im confused as to how someone could film this and think this is wonderful!
/m/outlier_2021	bfea5ada-5a58-3cf2-bc13-8d1acf357300	5	Considering this was shot during lockdown with little to no money, and technically no crew, this held my attention very well. Great shots and composition, some memorable lines and moments, and a good soundtrack. Can't wait to see what the director can bring us with a bigger budget and a bigger team.
/m/outlier_2021	bfea5ada-5a58-3cf2-bc13-8d1acf357300	5	Great film for a first time director. Kept me intrigued and suspenseful the entire movie!
/m/outlier_2021	bfea5ada-5a58-3cf2-bc13-8d1acf357300	1	A sorting cube script without any of its colorful shapes. Outlier is a commendable feat in its conception for a first time filmmaker, but misses any real intrigue or understanding of the subject it tries to tackle. Lacking a real second act, Outlier goes in circles, and while you may be led to believe it’s perhaps a result of its implication of the endless cycle of abuse, the film fails to ever give any connection to that assumption and instead gives a muddled, displeasing end to an overall hollow and lifeless film.
/m/the_deep_house	551a25b2-72c3-3256-9b19-9d2abff79929	2	Interesting concept. Plain story. An okay horor movie.
/m/the_deep_house	551a25b2-72c3-3256-9b19-9d2abff79929	4.5	Claustrophobic, atmospheric. A truly horrifying horror film!
/m/the_deep_house	551a25b2-72c3-3256-9b19-9d2abff79929	4	It's an interesting twist to the tired, old horror genre…and horror has really taken a beating with the lack of originality and lack of Hollywood interest in trying something new or attempting anything original. OK, so maybe it's just "Sinister" set underwater but the set is creepy, the atmosphere is dark and to me, that's half the battle when trying to scare an audience. Very few jump scares (fortunately) but it manages to sustain a deeper, creepy feeling that I prefer to the generic, mindless jump scare. The only drawback to the underwater scenes…the usual shakey cam where you can't tell what's really going on. But the cinematography is well done overall and the house is indeed very traditionally Haunted looking. I have a feeling that audience ratings will suffer pretty drastically due to the ending (which I didn't care for much but sometimes…meh, things done turn out the way you think they might. If you stay and watch past all of the credits, you'll see that there will likely be a sequel…that's all I'm going to say. And if there is a second one, I'll go see it. Kudos to the director for at least trying something new in a genre that has become almost insufferable over the past decade.
/m/the_deep_house	551a25b2-72c3-3256-9b19-9d2abff79929	2	Although the underwater photography is impressive, this film definitely is not. Too little material for an hour and a half. Not a lot of horror either, mostly a lot of 'Oh, my god, I am so scared'. Very mediocre.  When you've seen the trailer, you've actually seen the whole movie.

/m/the_deep_house	551a25b2-72c3-3256-9b19-9d2abff79929	1.5	The movie is quite like grave encounters but underwater. The male actor needs to improve his acting skills .
/m/the_deep_house	551a25b2-72c3-3256-9b19-9d2abff79929	5	I thought this film was very well made and filming underwater brought a claustrophobic edge to film.
/m/the_deep_house	551a25b2-72c3-3256-9b19-9d2abff79929	2	The idea of a haunted house underwater was better than the execution. When video maker and girlfriend dive into the submerged house, they discover its (unsurprising) history and fight to get out.
/m/the_deep_house	551a25b2-72c3-3256-9b19-9d2abff79929	3.5	I enjoyed it! The ambiance, and some of the scenes, are suffocating/stressfull as hell! It's a good movie to watch alone with the sound UP!!!...or not. :/
/m/the_deep_house	551a25b2-72c3-3256-9b19-9d2abff79929	0.5	A dumb, dull dud.  Jagger is awful.
/m/bigfoot_famous	634fc8d8-9bb3-3d90-b716-952812f21b9b	2	When a viral video of Bigfoot emerges, a once-popular influencer goes on a mission to film a video with the creature and get famous again, which really seems like this should be something that really happens.  An improvised film made in eight days and shot on location in the Redwoods and Los Angeles, this movie is all about getting likes and follows, no matter how close to ending your life you have to get.  Made by creative duo Sam Milman and Peter Vass, there's a good chance that the like and submit buttons may not be the only thing that gets smashed. Here's to an entire gaggle of influencers trying to hunt down the Jersey Devil, White Thang, the Fouke Monster, Altamaha-ha, Sharlie, Champy, the Loveland Frogmen, Taku-He and the Beast of Bray Road.
/m/bigfoot_famous	634fc8d8-9bb3-3d90-b716-952812f21b9b	5	Really funny and great social commentary!
/m/needle_in_a_timestack	d96dc512-0cfd-32c0-8ef0-4405ef16a571	5	Very little science fiction but i did appreciate the actors doing the work. If you enjoy human connection and relationships this is a great gem. Especaially in a sea of silly and just awful gilms. I had my reservations going in but i liked to be suprised like this. Would watch again and its a great date movie.
/m/needle_in_a_timestack	d96dc512-0cfd-32c0-8ef0-4405ef16a571	1	It sounded interesting at least some, but all of it falls way short of being entertaining.
/m/needle_in_a_timestack	d96dc512-0cfd-32c0-8ef0-4405ef16a571	1.5	The concept of the movie is quite interesting and the short add generated a lot of interest. The movie thought is in the form of Drama. It turns out to be very slow and so one loses interest.
/m/needle_in_a_timestack	d96dc512-0cfd-32c0-8ef0-4405ef16a571	2	The film introduces some really great and novel time travel concepts (from the mind of Sci-Fi writer Robert Silverberg) - which makes it worth checking (out on a plane  - or at least skimming), but ironically takes way too long telling its drawn out story about star-crossed lovers that we're supposed to care about — but don't.   Why not? Because this film makes the mistake of telling rather than showing us all about the great loves supposedly  gained and lost in this film. Thus all the romance feels shallow, put on and even adolescent at times. As if glossy cinematography with one character staring at another and talking about love — equals love..  The lead character (played convincingly by Leslie Odom Jr.)  feels broodingly self-absorbed, and the same can be said for the filmmaker, who in making a film that is (sort of) about time crimes, has committed the worst time crime of all — making an over-long movie that tells you what you're supposed to be- but are not actually- feeling. And so you cone out feeling as empty and tired as an unskilled time traveler.   Note to all screenwriters and filmmakers out there - making a film slow-paced and long, without developing characters or relationships, does not give it necessary weight or credibilty. It's just long.
/m/needle_in_a_timestack	d96dc512-0cfd-32c0-8ef0-4405ef16a571	5	This movie featured a wonderful message of love and touched on themes of unconditional friendship, and near-future science fiction.
/m/needle_in_a_timestack	d96dc512-0cfd-32c0-8ef0-4405ef16a571	3.5	All in all, this is a pretty good film, but only if you are expecting a soft character plot going in. If you are hoping for a repeat of the kind of power shown in "Twelve Years A Slave," or "Three Kings," you'll be disappointed. But if you're expecting a mild drama to begin with, you'll be able to relax and enjoy.
/m/needle_in_a_timestack	d96dc512-0cfd-32c0-8ef0-4405ef16a571	2	It tries something new with the time traveling romance stories, but Needle in a Timestack is quite the mess to follow and fully understand its confusing premise of losing, gaining and removing your love from everything. A fascinating failure !
/m/the_many_saints_of_newark	f64ae5da-8e53-32ed-b843-9d876b302799	2	Should be in the dictionary as the very definition of Meh.
/m/the_many_saints_of_newark	f64ae5da-8e53-32ed-b843-9d876b302799	2	From a great story, to turning it into something that made it an absolute waste of time.
/m/the_many_saints_of_newark	f64ae5da-8e53-32ed-b843-9d876b302799	2	They tried to be like the Godfather and failed miserably. Pathetic😂
/m/the_many_saints_of_newark	f64ae5da-8e53-32ed-b843-9d876b302799	1	Missed the mark, unfortunately. It comes off as a social justice commentary squeezed into The Sopranos universe, and it just doesn't work.
/m/the_many_saints_of_newark	f64ae5da-8e53-32ed-b843-9d876b302799	3	Show failed on so many levels.
/m/the_many_saints_of_newark	f64ae5da-8e53-32ed-b843-9d876b302799	3.5	Some wonderful casting (it's uncanny how convincing some of the actors are as the younger versions of Sopranos characters - far beyond just Michael Gandolfini's resemblance to his late father), and generally an enjoyable run through the 60's and 70's. But probably doesn't stand strong enough on its own two feet to have massive appeal to anyone who isn't a fan of the Sopranos.
/m/the_many_saints_of_newark	f64ae5da-8e53-32ed-b843-9d876b302799	0.5	Anyone who says this is a good film, CLEARLY doesn't know anything about the Sopranos.   This movie was SO TERRIBLE, it offended me on a personal level as an Italian.  Instead of a Sopranos movie, you get more of a BLM/PC cash grab, capitalizing on a chance to profit off of racial tension in the country currently.   It is SO bad, James Gandolfini is turning in his grave. It is SO bad, so VERY VERY BAD.
/m/the_many_saints_of_newark	f64ae5da-8e53-32ed-b843-9d876b302799	4	Crybaby right wing trailer parkers will cry because this movie doesn't push their Facebook talking points --- Solid prequel to the Sopranos, wish it was longer so we could have more time with these characters. The role of young tony was played well. Its not some breathtaking masterpiece but it is a great prequel to the greatest show in TV history. The story isn't too bad either
/m/the_many_saints_of_newark	f64ae5da-8e53-32ed-b843-9d876b302799	4	Great prequel to a hit series.
/m/the_many_saints_of_newark	f64ae5da-8e53-32ed-b843-9d876b302799	2.5	I tried to come in with tempered expectations but was still ultimately left underwhelmed. I did enjoy revisiting some of these characters and appreciated the creativity on display in some of the portrayals and origin stories, as well as the many nods to future Sopranos touchstones.  I think it was always going to be hard to please fans of such a beloved long running series in just a two hour span so I tried to be more forgiving and appreciate the brief visit.
/m/in_full_bloom	b8251fec-aabb-3c06-8139-93846a02fa85	5	I loved being on the journey with both fighters. The winter scenes were stunning and the fight reminded me of Hajime no Ippo...so sick!
/m/in_full_bloom	b8251fec-aabb-3c06-8139-93846a02fa85	5	Something really fresh and beautiful. Combines beautiful cinematography, a period piece, themed of honor and and courage, and brings it all to the boxing genre. It will have a place in the great boxing films of all time. A must see
/m/in_full_bloom	b8251fec-aabb-3c06-8139-93846a02fa85	5	Watched this with my wife last night and we were kind of left in awe. Its so unique but also feels like I've seen it before. Obviously the movie is beautiful so kudos to them for capturing the beauty. The acting can seem wooden at times, but it kind of works? Or maybe I'm just a super fan now haha. Anyways loved it.
/m/in_full_bloom	b8251fec-aabb-3c06-8139-93846a02fa85	5	What a movie! Unique, beautiful and full of life
/m/in_full_bloom	b8251fec-aabb-3c06-8139-93846a02fa85	5	My favorite film of the year! It reminds me of an anime
/m/in_full_bloom	b8251fec-aabb-3c06-8139-93846a02fa85	5	Really beautiful film. Loved every moment!
/m/adventures_of_a_mathematician	90376e89-d35a-3e09-a717-228cb8634aa2	3	An interesting story about a very interesting man, as other already said a bit dry at time but still enjoyable
/m/fully_realized_humans	2d66fcbe-779d-47ec-a225-063034d6b20e	5	It's a fresh comedy, it also shows some day to day modern couple's paradigms. Pretty entertaining, must watch it.
/m/the_old_ways_2020	e0ac3c95-5714-3567-b63e-af8689cdcd00	4.5	A near perfect possession story with layer after layer of social commentary.
/m/the_old_ways_2020	e0ac3c95-5714-3567-b63e-af8689cdcd00	5	Great movie, nice to have Christian ideals removed from the equation in a modern movie
/m/the_old_ways_2020	e0ac3c95-5714-3567-b63e-af8689cdcd00	3	Talk about going pretty far for a story. Cristina Lopez, a Mexican-American reporter, has come back to her hometown near Veracruz — do I needlessly need to remind horror movie characters to never go home again — to write about witchcraft when she became the story itself as the bruja believes that Cristina is possessed. Well, you know, when your mother was possessed and that demon left you all scratched up too, you kind of become a suspect.  That demon could also be her heroin addiction. Just maybe.  Or maybe it is the demon Postehki, who makes her throw up hair and black ooze.  Or maybe it's both?  Regardless, Cristina must live up to the title — the old ways — to become the bruja of her village and successfully repel the demon — and others like it — once and for all.  I really liked how this film blended Mexican folk horror with the traditional possession film moments. Director Christopher Alender and writer Marcos Gabriel worked together on Memorial Day way back in 1999 before returning to their horror roots. With the success of this film, I can say that some people can go home again.  There's an amazing moment when teeth and snakes get pulled out of Cristina. It only gets wilder from there.
/m/the_old_ways_2020	e0ac3c95-5714-3567-b63e-af8689cdcd00	4	this was actually a good movie , it started slow but after the middle it kept getting better . i didnt expect it . the storyline / characters and lore was nice . the effects good and not over the top , costumes and music pretty good too!
/m/the_old_ways_2020	e0ac3c95-5714-3567-b63e-af8689cdcd00	1	Lifetime movies have more punch than this paint-by-numbers nonsense.
/m/the_old_ways_2020	e0ac3c95-5714-3567-b63e-af8689cdcd00	3.5	Oddly different for sure but too much of a slow burn to be fully satisfying. There's definitely a voice here in this exorcism movie deeply focused on a long continuus process of chasing a too much unseen demon to be really scary but is saved by a spooky ambiance and great visuals.
/m/the_old_ways_2020	e0ac3c95-5714-3567-b63e-af8689cdcd00	5	The Old Ways does an excellent job at directing the plot. The movie moves at a quick speed, yet it still manages to leave an effect on me. The video "guided" viewers into a difficult-to-describe sense of terror by using a narrow, black background. The actors, on the other hand, were not very impressive. That, though, was far too excellent for the acting. Movies can delve further into topics like drugs, witchcraft, and so on, but this one does not (this is a rather unfortunate point in the film). In terms of the horror genre in general, and the exorcism genre in particular, this is an amazing film.
/m/the_old_ways_2020	e0ac3c95-5714-3567-b63e-af8689cdcd00	2.5	This needed a little more character development for the Christina that way we would have cared more about the events. Decent practical effects...just ok. Full review below:  I published my new episode The Old Ways, please check it out https://www.podbean.com/ea/pb-y4s24-10d4a1a
/m/the_old_ways_2020	e0ac3c95-5714-3567-b63e-af8689cdcd00	0.5	This movie was HORRIBLE!!!
/m/the_old_ways_2020	e0ac3c95-5714-3567-b63e-af8689cdcd00	2	Great concept, poorly executed essentially a B movie.
/m/through_the_glass_darkly	fcd67ad0-d690-42bd-8314-17d3181fc573	2	A year after her daughter's disappearance in Elrod, Georgia, another local girl goes missing and Charlie (Robin Lively, The Karate Kid Part III, Lana Milford from Twin Peaks) is convinced that there is a connection. The only bad part? The police and community believe that Charlie is guilty of this new abduction.  Originally known as Through the Glass Darkly, this is the full-length directorial debut of Lauren Fash. She does a great job at balancing the Southern gothic and stranger in a strange land dynamics of this movie in very subtle ways. The real villain of this piece may as well be the town of Elrod.  While she's wary of the reporter in town trying to get her first big story, Georgia is smart enough to know how to use her to get the information that she really wants. Yet everyone in town seems to know more than they should while also believing that our protagonist is the cause of all of her own — and so many others' — challenges.
/m/the_addams_family_2	6b5b79bc-a406-3949-a53b-1197f2a137ff	3	I found this to be quite a lot better than the first movie in terms of entertainment value, mostly because the frequent changes of scenery gave them more opportunities for Pugsley-related jokes; the part where he farts underwater drew a prolonged belly laugh from me and my 7-year-old. It seems the most successful kids movies are those with a kid-friendly plot but jokes that adults can enjoy; this one went did the opposite, with a very adult-oriented plot but with strictly child-level jokes. I've seen a few other movies like that, mostly live-action ones like See Spot Run, and in no example I've seen can I say it was truly successful, but they come pretty close here. Outside of the general infeasibility of the plot, the main drawback for me was their bizarre, unnecessary and unsubtle side-focus of critiquing the "participation trophy generation", using it as the catalyst to the plot by dumbing it down significantly & implying that the clear winner of an individual competition like a science fair would get the exact same prize as anyone else with no additional recognition whatsoever, and that the kid who is treated this way would be in the mood to abandon their family and pursue the individual greatness that they'd been denied. The addition of Hader to the voice cast was nice though.
/m/the_addams_family_2	6b5b79bc-a406-3949-a53b-1197f2a137ff	4	Funny and great animation. My 11 yr old loved it.
/m/the_addams_family_2	6b5b79bc-a406-3949-a53b-1197f2a137ff	5	Cute movie.  We enjoyed it.
/m/the_addams_family_2	6b5b79bc-a406-3949-a53b-1197f2a137ff	5	It was great for my grandsons first movie.  It held his attention and was fun for the whole family.
/m/the_addams_family_2	6b5b79bc-a406-3949-a53b-1197f2a137ff	5	Ive seen this movie 16 times in theaters so far, not even joking. Its honestly one of the best movies Ive ever seen. Great jokes, wholesome characters, an engaging plot, this movie has it all.
/m/the_addams_family_2	6b5b79bc-a406-3949-a53b-1197f2a137ff	5	Really enjoyed this movie!  Good family fun

/m/the_addams_family_2	6b5b79bc-a406-3949-a53b-1197f2a137ff	3.5	It was cute, but wish it was funnier and that it wasn’t about Wednesday again and more about the whole family.
/m/the_addams_family_2	6b5b79bc-a406-3949-a53b-1197f2a137ff	3.5	is good for view in family
/m/the_addams_family_2	6b5b79bc-a406-3949-a53b-1197f2a137ff	4	Funny , good story , fun for all , my children enjoyed and I had a couple of good laughs as well .
/m/sophie_jones	880facf1-fa7f-4804-bd9c-0d237b5fccfb	5	Very moving film about a character who's in pain but having trouble channeling that feeling. Felt authentic and really nicely detailed too. Just really got to me.
/m/sophie_jones	880facf1-fa7f-4804-bd9c-0d237b5fccfb	2.5	Meh... Slow and boring. Kept waiting for something bit this just didn't do it for me.
/m/sophie_jones	880facf1-fa7f-4804-bd9c-0d237b5fccfb	5	This film is for those that have lost someone and understand that period of time between who you were before the loss and who you are to become. It's authentic, sensitive and also very entertaining. It left me feeling hopeful and am so happy and I highly recommend giving it a watch!!
/m/sophie_jones	880facf1-fa7f-4804-bd9c-0d237b5fccfb	5	A beautiful piece of art that portrays what it means to grow up while going through a deep grieving process. I enjoyed every minute of this film.
/m/sophie_jones	880facf1-fa7f-4804-bd9c-0d237b5fccfb	5	An honest depiction of grief and the teen experience delivered through beautifully cinematic imagery. Not the typically indulgent portrayals we tend to see, this film tugs on your heart in a way that lingers.
/m/sophie_jones	880facf1-fa7f-4804-bd9c-0d237b5fccfb	1	This movie was entirely stereotyped and lacked any creativity what so ever. This movie is very similar to any other movie out there.
/m/sophie_jones	880facf1-fa7f-4804-bd9c-0d237b5fccfb	5	An authentic, emotional, and deeply moving film that captures essence of losing a parent at a young age.
/m/sophie_jones	880facf1-fa7f-4804-bd9c-0d237b5fccfb	5	What a beautifully filmed exploration of the intersection of grief and loss of innocence . The acting is superb and the writing, lyrical with a touch of romanticism.
/m/sophie_jones	880facf1-fa7f-4804-bd9c-0d237b5fccfb	5	Such a sensitive, nuance movie. I was gripped by it the whole way through. All of the actors were nuanced, powerful. Love it!
/m/mayday_2021	ec76f5fc-d90d-485b-a3f3-3117d55fae48	5	Such a great exploration of this moment in the developing feminist consciousness.
/m/mayday_2021	ec76f5fc-d90d-485b-a3f3-3117d55fae48	5	Disregard the bad reviews.  The film is refreshingly different. Not a romance, not a war movie, not a mystery or a sci fi.  First of all, enter the fantasy. This is a movie on par with the Wizard of Oz.  It's not so much about feminism than self-determination (which is feminism).  It's great.
/m/coming_home_in_the_dark	4fd987b9-d12b-4574-8e8c-9b02daee32a4	1	A total mess of a film. This is a B-Grade schlock movie with pretensions to art but it just doesnt work and a good reason why you shouldn't make features from short stories - there simply isn't enough going on. I even bought and read the short story by the brilliant writer Owen Marshall, on whose short story this is based, just to see where things had gone so badly wrong.   It's a classic case of professional reviewers being so jaded that when something that appears to be arty and deep comes along they fall over themselves to praise the film they think they see, not the one that actually exists. Especially so in small old NZ where this movie is set, reviewers are notoriously cowardly here.  (Spoilers follow)  The movie never recovers from the shocking act of violence near the start, it's too big, too crazy, too unbelieavble.  In the short story everything is like brief intense bad dream, a nightmare of how an ordinary day about how suddenly things can go completely wrong, how parallel universes can unexpectedly crossover. But it's nightmare and not a good plot for a movie.  If the murder of the two children at the start had not happened, and only the kidnapping had occured, it might have worked.  As it was you have no sympathy at all with the killers, you question the reactions of the parents - their kids have just been murdered and they're being driven in the car but the wife - hands untied - does not grab the steering wheel when they're travelling past a cop car. Seriously? There are countless moments like this.  It seems that in the directors bid to pad out the story a backstory about the abuse at the boys home is put in to "explain" the actions of the baddies. Either you follow Marshall's feverish nighmare surreal story or you make it a believable action movie but this falls between two stools.  Acting was very patchy.  It's incredibly ironic that out of all Owen Marshall's brilliant stories with their living and breathing characters he gets this shlocky ultra-violent misinterpretation of his work.
/m/coming_home_in_the_dark	4fd987b9-d12b-4574-8e8c-9b02daee32a4	4	Thrilling! What a watch! Kept me in suspense the entire movie!
/m/coming_home_in_the_dark	4fd987b9-d12b-4574-8e8c-9b02daee32a4	4	Sombrío regreso a casa  Esta producción neozelandesa es tan inquietante que se hace un camino empinado poder llegar en el visionado de la misma hasta el final. El argumento de una típica familia que sale a visitar una costa balnearia y encuentra en el trayecto una pesadilla amenazante es poco original. Pero aquí el director y co-guionista James Ashcrofty le imprime al asunto un tratamiento admirable. Hay momentos en que da la sensación de que por atrás se encuentra la mano de Tarantino imprimiendo golpes de violencia, irracionalidad y cierto toque de misterio.  Un pasado oscuro de sometimientos a jóvenes infractores de terribles abusos físicos y psíquicos se proyecta en el presente de esta familia con descubrimiento de secretos y de impensados roles asumidos por el protagonista (notable trabajo del actor Daniel Guilles) en una espiral de sometimiento, sangre y venganza que te deja con el corazón en la boca.  El tratamiento estético que es muy funcional a la tragedia, especialmente la fotografía que retrata el drama desde el atardecer internándose en la noche profunda y amenazadora, puede hacer que la comprensión de la trama se dificulte un poco por la iluminación tan contrastada y sombría, pero no deja de ser un hallazgo que te conduce por el horror sin necesidad de extensos parlamentos ni de acciones explícitas, casi todo es sugerido con el maravilloso trabajo del reparto y de la banda sonora.  Debe advertirse que esta es una película muy dura de ver y, a veces, de comprender en una primera visión. Aquellos que la vean en un DVD o similar soporte deberán acudir en más de una oportunidad a rebobinar escenas para una mejor comprensión.  Al final se deshilacha un poquito la tensión y no se aprovechó la posibilidad de dar un toque final contundente al asunto, cosa en la que es muy efectivo el Tarantino antes mencionado.  Gran película. Gran reparto. Gran dirección. Gran guión. Gran recomendación para tomarse un tiempo reflexivo para ver esta obra.
/m/coming_home_in_the_dark	4fd987b9-d12b-4574-8e8c-9b02daee32a4	4	Ugh what a cheery little movie this was!  Not sure why I subjected myself to it. Warning - do not watch this if in need of something to lift ones spirits.  My god so depressing. However, the acting and dialogue are superb. The whole thing is very believable.
/m/coming_home_in_the_dark	4fd987b9-d12b-4574-8e8c-9b02daee32a4	5	Really solid kiwi film, what starts of as seeming like just another survival horror flick quickly evolves into something deeper and more sinister. I wish more horrors / thrillers had a bit of depth to them like this one. Proof that good kiwi cinema is still alive and kicking.
/m/coming_home_in_the_dark	4fd987b9-d12b-4574-8e8c-9b02daee32a4	3.5	When a couple of drifters descend on the family outing, it immediately gets really tense and really ugly. Even though it's not really a 'horror' flick, it delivers on creating tension.
/m/coming_home_in_the_dark	4fd987b9-d12b-4574-8e8c-9b02daee32a4	4	That is the bleakest movie I have seen since Irreversible.
/m/coming_home_in_the_dark	4fd987b9-d12b-4574-8e8c-9b02daee32a4	1.5	I guess it's reassuring to realize that it's not just American movies that have become almost unwatchable, cliche and implausible.  Why are so many movies from New Zealand about families being kidnapped and adults getting stolen? Is that like a real, common thing over there? American thrillers everyone just gets shot or killed. In New Zealand, everyone gets kidnapped and driven around for days or hidden away in some underground vault. It's seriously weird.
/m/coming_home_in_the_dark	4fd987b9-d12b-4574-8e8c-9b02daee32a4	2.5	Wow!  90% of this film was shot in the dark, so difficult to make out what was happening most of the time.  Also actors accents were so strong that it made it twice as hard to understand what was being said!!
/m/coming_home_in_the_dark	4fd987b9-d12b-4574-8e8c-9b02daee32a4	5	A beautiful film. Excellent acting, excruciating suspense, very dark, The way I like it.
/m/the_blazing_world_2021	7dc3118a-dc5e-44be-b993-a7fdab3475a7	3	Visually stunning with a great eery score . As far as a directorial debut I think Carlson has an incredible career ahead of herself . 3/5
/m/the_blazing_world_2021	7dc3118a-dc5e-44be-b993-a7fdab3475a7	3.5	Films like this are for a select niche group movie-goers.  I love these psychological plots. The sound, colors, the art and the metaphoric symbolism were decent in it.  The story i had to watch twice though to really grasp. Story is decent but I've seen better. You'll either enjoy it or You'll hate it.   Its a select genre.
/m/the_blazing_world_2021	7dc3118a-dc5e-44be-b993-a7fdab3475a7	4.5	5 stars for originality , style and atmosphere. Though not quite there, Young has all the makings of a modern horror maestro, a la Peele. This almost felt like it could have been the 5th season of Channel Zero (a good thing). This is a very original script and I cannot wait to see what comes out of her mind in the future.
/m/im_your_man_2021	5ca6f59a-5586-4ae0-b9af-360247d4699b	5	I wondered whether the premise would wear thin, but I needn't have worried. The film keeps you guessing right up to the unpredictable final moments. Very warmly recommended!
/m/im_your_man_2021	5ca6f59a-5586-4ae0-b9af-360247d4699b	4.5	Beautiful cinematographic and script, one of the best films of 2021
/m/im_your_man_2021	5ca6f59a-5586-4ae0-b9af-360247d4699b	5	I was ready to not like it but I did like it. I gave it a chance because it seems like it might be interesting and creative in its exploration, and it was.
/m/im_your_man_2021	5ca6f59a-5586-4ae0-b9af-360247d4699b	5	Absolutely captivating film! While I typically don't watch subtitles films---this is worth watching. Maren Eggert and Dan Stevens are incredible in their roles. The film had some funny parts but also heart-breaking scenes. It is a MUST WATCH if you need something different. (Buy or rent on Apple TV). I definitely see this film being nominated for movie awards!
/m/im_your_man_2021	5ca6f59a-5586-4ae0-b9af-360247d4699b	5	Amazing movie with layered performances. Somehow a comedy, but full of deep thought and stunning revelations about humanity and love. I suggest purchasing it, as you will want to watch it again. And again.
/m/im_your_man_2021	5ca6f59a-5586-4ae0-b9af-360247d4699b	4	This is a really delightful, off-kilter comedy with surprising insight into human relationships. Dan Stevens is a comic delight, speaking German throughout, as a robot designed and submitted for approval and evaluation as a lover/companion for a single professional woman. I hope this is Germany's submission in the Oscar race for Best Foreign Language Film. It's pretty great.
/m/im_your_man_2021	5ca6f59a-5586-4ae0-b9af-360247d4699b	4	I’m Your Man is a very interesting sci-fi romance. Dan Stevens and Maren Eggert were both great. I liked how their relationship developed throughout the film. The film tackles its themes of loneliness and love very well. It kept me engaged throughout. Overall, I quite enjoyed this. It’s smart, funny, and never boring. It takes a smart concept and develops it well. Definitely check it out.
/m/im_your_man_2021	5ca6f59a-5586-4ae0-b9af-360247d4699b	4	Stevens e o comoara, restul e bun
/m/im_your_man_2021	5ca6f59a-5586-4ae0-b9af-360247d4699b	5	Fantastic. I don't really know where to start as I'm caught up in my emotions. Beautiful film. Existential for sure. A+
/m/im_your_man_2021	5ca6f59a-5586-4ae0-b9af-360247d4699b	3	I felt the story was interesting and the acting was very good. Overall, I'm just not into this type of movie involving robots.
/m/witch_hunt_2021	6255618c-6e1a-4b5d-aff5-86422fda2baf	3	Functional and just watchable. I really liked the idea of an underground railroad for witches where they are neither malevolent nor overly good and could be a next-door neighbor with unusual abilities.  That premise propped up what would have been an otherwise very average supernatural film.  The transparent comparison of our immigration issues and policies didn't go unnoticed.
/m/witch_hunt_2021	6255618c-6e1a-4b5d-aff5-86422fda2baf	3	Clever, relevant and disturbing though ultimately less than it could have been I still recommend it.
/m/witch_hunt_2021	6255618c-6e1a-4b5d-aff5-86422fda2baf	2.5	I enjoyed it but didn't like how the ending turns out. Hope there will be part two.
/m/witch_hunt_2021	6255618c-6e1a-4b5d-aff5-86422fda2baf	1	Witch Hunt 2021 (not to be confused for the superior HBO movie of the same name starring Dennis Hopper) is a mopey and angsty teen of a movie thinking it is saying something profound and important.  All the while, that state is muddled and half-baked and overall any kind of 'political' statement attempting lessens an already weak film.  The concept that witches are such a threat to United States theirs an 11th amendment to basically "suffer not the witch to live" might be workable.  However, the movie is not interested in world building that idea nearly enough for the audience to buy-in.  Sure, there are witches that are said to murder people with their powers, but so do serial killers, and they seem to still get due process while the former don't.  Ultimately, Witch Hunt 2021 isn't a horror movie.  There are brief scenes suggesting supernatural horror, but they habitually line step well over the boundary between tense and boring.  Often for little to no pay off, as the movie does enjoy its attempts at fake-out scares.  Anyone seeking this movie for thrills and chills are going to leave unsatisfied.
/m/stop_and_go	be4f8d1f-2a6c-4970-bc89-df0d56c20536	5	I love this show and can relate to it as well! I've watched wit and mal since they started doing studio c! I love these guys so much.
/m/stop_and_go	be4f8d1f-2a6c-4970-bc89-df0d56c20536	5	I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! It was a little haunting to remember what the early days were like, but the humor was great and the wacky situations had a quirky twist. The movie *is* PG-13 and not G rated, so don't be surprised about period talk or dating disasters. I'd watch it again and again. 5 out of 5 popcorn tubs.
/m/stop_and_go	be4f8d1f-2a6c-4970-bc89-df0d56c20536	3	This kinda worked as a bit quirky 2.9
/m/stop_and_go	be4f8d1f-2a6c-4970-bc89-df0d56c20536	4	Stop and Go made me smile throughout. Whitney and Mallory's chemistry, coupled with very authentic and real sibling dialogue, truly makes this movie such fun to watch. I was really surprised by the 2 lead characters' banter, because it's so true to life when 2 siblings joke around with each other and break out into laughter fits. This authenticity just isn't seen much on film. But this movie embraced that quality.   Sure, some gags just don't hit, and the film lags a bit in the middle. But, It's so rare to find a film this infectiously sweet and goofy. I'll be watching this again very soon.
/m/stop_and_go	be4f8d1f-2a6c-4970-bc89-df0d56c20536	0.5	"Stop and Go" (by some of the old cast from Studio C) is not the wholesome family-friendly movie you might think it is. After scenes talking extensively about shoving things up a woman's privates, getting "Dick Picks" on her phone, talking about sexual encounters, we walked out and got a refund for the family.
/m/stop_and_go	be4f8d1f-2a6c-4970-bc89-df0d56c20536	0.5	I was hoping for the nostalgic comedy of the old Studio C cast, thinking this might be a family friendly comedy. I was sorely disappointed. While it had some funny moments, we had to stop watching around the 30 minute mark due to the lengthy discussion of male anatomy.
/m/stop_and_go	be4f8d1f-2a6c-4970-bc89-df0d56c20536	5	I absolutely loved it! It was different from what I was expecting mainly because I know and love the two mains from their Studi C days and JK Studios, but nevertheless, it was amazing! I loved the comedy and the chemistry between the two sisters! I could rewatch this movie over and over again, it's amazing!
/m/not_going_quietly	b8e30a0a-f509-4d9b-aa31-007a77f0b49b	5	This documentary is highly moving. It's done with compassion and urgency and ends on a note of hope.
/m/not_going_quietly	b8e30a0a-f509-4d9b-aa31-007a77f0b49b	5	One of the most important and moving films I have ever seen.  Challenges us each to do work for healthcare for all and for each of us to be abetter person.
/m/seance_2021	cbd4dd52-2cd4-4d26-ae06-878f3dc74aba	3	Meh, it passed the time. This movie didn't bring anything new to the horror genre. It wasn't bad. I wouldn't watch again. It's something you can put on while you do something else.
/m/seance_2021	cbd4dd52-2cd4-4d26-ae06-878f3dc74aba	0.5	Wow, that was bad. Extremely convoluted and boring.
/m/seance_2021	cbd4dd52-2cd4-4d26-ae06-878f3dc74aba	0.5	This movie is stupid. Boring. And the lead gives such a monotone performance. If you’re looking for movies to watch ahead of Halloween — skip this one!!
/m/seance_2021	cbd4dd52-2cd4-4d26-ae06-878f3dc74aba	2	When a fake Seance leads to a college girl's death - all hell brakes loose in this girl's boarding school.  It's a banal plot that quickly detours towards slasher fodder at the end.
/m/seance_2021	cbd4dd52-2cd4-4d26-ae06-878f3dc74aba	3.5	Seance é um excelente slasher que até a sua metade parece ser um PG-13 e depois joga sangue na sua cara,sua subtrama paranormal e um tanto desnecessária. Mas não afeta seu desempenho
/m/seance_2021	cbd4dd52-2cd4-4d26-ae06-878f3dc74aba	1	Waterhouse cannot save it
/m/seance_2021	cbd4dd52-2cd4-4d26-ae06-878f3dc74aba	2.5	There is something to admire with how Seance subverts its own sub-genre's predictability (particularly in the final 20 minutes), with obvious nods to the likes of You're Next with its Dawn of the Dead-esque score and fitting final girl.  For such a fun and violent payoff means enduring an unfortunate dose of bland writing and pedestrian genre beats. You may get a little more than you'd bargain for with a movie called Seance, but to expect a completely fresh approach to such an on-the-nose sub-genre would be foolish.   It's no You're Next but it's a few notches about Temple let's just say that
/m/seance_2021	cbd4dd52-2cd4-4d26-ae06-878f3dc74aba	2.5	I went to this film because writer/director Simon Barrett wrote two very good films in the last 10 years (The Guest, You're Next), so I thought I'd check his directorial debut feature film. I don't think this one is nearly as good as either aforementioned films, but it was not bad either. This film tries to be clever by switching genra several times, but it never fully sold me on its goods to be frank. It borrows heavily from films like Scream, The Craft, Suspiria, Urban Legends that it really doesn't have a distinguished identity of its own. Still, I wasn't bored, Suki Waterhouse (as the lead) has a good screen presence, and it more or less has a satisfying ending, so that most count towards something.
/m/seance_2021	cbd4dd52-2cd4-4d26-ae06-878f3dc74aba	4	“SEANCE” stars Suki Waterhouse as the lead star. It’s a low-budget slasher/horror that’s almost like a drama. The director does a good job of keeping you in suspense, and you want to see what happens next. After the suspense, you get a 2 second peak of the kill. It’s disappointing, but the story and pace keeps you gripped. It has cheesy moments, and also terrifying moments. Around the middle of the movie, it started turning into a mystery drama, but the ending really surprised me and had lots of blood. Although it’s disappointing, it’s still fun if you don’t think about it much and just have fun. 4/5
/m/seance_2021	cbd4dd52-2cd4-4d26-ae06-878f3dc74aba	3	An intenresting blend of horror subgenres going from ghost stroy to surprisingly gory without remorse slasher with a twist. Hits all the conventions and has difficulties to make its characters really exist but still reserve some thrills. An enjoyable watch for genre lovers.
/m/east_of_the_mountains	6b4e329b-21e2-35f0-ba3e-91bbd4d9b576	4.5	Thoroughly enjoyed this. I can understand why the yank audience didn't enjoy it cos theys wasn't 'nuff shootin' and a hollerin'!!
/m/east_of_the_mountains	6b4e329b-21e2-35f0-ba3e-91bbd4d9b576	2.5	How this is getting a solid 100% by the "professional reviewers" is beyond me.  The dialog is ultra simple. The dialog's delivery is slow and monotonous the majority of the time.  There are added scenes that added nothing to the story, such as the "loving couple" that picks up the protagonist to merely help him reflect on his past life with his wife.  Them slipping him weed also was totally unnessary.  The ending was also a dead fish in that he resolved nothing other than he finally faced death by challenging the town bully's gun, so now he could go home happy with his daughter and dog?!
/m/east_of_the_mountains	6b4e329b-21e2-35f0-ba3e-91bbd4d9b576	2	The only reason this got a 2 star was because the scenery was truly beautiful. Trying to figure what this movie was all about. Was it about a man and his dog? Nope. A love story? Nope. Family? Nope. A cranky, morose old man? Yep.
/m/east_of_the_mountains	6b4e329b-21e2-35f0-ba3e-91bbd4d9b576	4.5	Tom Skerritt wows in this character study of a man dealing with mortality, loneliness and life. His performance is nuanced and touching, allowing the audience to see life through the character's eyes and heart. A real gem...
/m/east_of_the_mountains	6b4e329b-21e2-35f0-ba3e-91bbd4d9b576	4	Good but nothing mega exciting happens
/m/east_of_the_mountains	6b4e329b-21e2-35f0-ba3e-91bbd4d9b576	2	Could have been. Should have been. Instead, it wasn't. Lame ending to a potentially deceit movie.
/m/east_of_the_mountains	6b4e329b-21e2-35f0-ba3e-91bbd4d9b576	4.5	Very good thoughtful movie!
/m/east_of_the_mountains	6b4e329b-21e2-35f0-ba3e-91bbd4d9b576	5	This was a powerfuly moving movie.  It made me literally weep
/m/falling_for_figaro	3e692c68-354c-3d67-93b7-25ef856c724a	4	Sometimes a film comes along that shouldn't be a hit because it is so niche. Take Falling For Figaro as an example, it's set in the Highlands of Scotland and has an overweight lead actress with a passion for singing opera so not really box office blockbuster material. Add into this mix lockdown shutting cinema theatres around the world and you can see that breaking even might be a big ask and yet, and yet…  What FFF has going for it is a girl with supreme confidence taking herself away from adoring work colleagues and a significant other to try and fast track her long held ambition to be a professional singer but she can't even get a place at a Conservatoire. Luckily for our lead, her tenacity sees her buying herself into a small Highland community in search of an income with a local pub to stay in which is a stone's throw away from a singing teacher with unusual methods who will work her students to their peak performance even if she breaks their heart in the process.  The film is sufficiently quirky to be interesting – a kind of slow burner with opera snatches that will ring a bell, sparkly dresses, unrequited love and proof that fast tracking isn't always the best course of action but sometimes it can be.  Our lead falls for opera but will the world of opera fall for her?
/m/falling_for_figaro	3e692c68-354c-3d67-93b7-25ef856c724a	4	Well it's obviously a fantasy because any other singer will tell you it takes more than A year to reach singing of that level. However it's a sweet movie and welcome fare in today's doom and gloom apocalyptic zombie nightmare future which everyone seems to want to feed us these days.
/m/falling_for_figaro	3e692c68-354c-3d67-93b7-25ef856c724a	5	Seen it on Netflix! Absolutely brilliant! Good mood guaranteed. Actors play is fantastic.
/m/falling_for_figaro	3e692c68-354c-3d67-93b7-25ef856c724a	2.5	"Falling For Figaro" is like an old, well-worn pair of slippers.  It is easy to slip into and comfortable in it's familiarity, but offers little support that you might from a new pair.  The characters are likeable and the performances decent.  The film offers little in the way of originality and surprises. From the early moments, it sets the viewer up to follow the often tread path.  I could see every turn ahead for miles.  And, alas, it doesn't even try to thrown in an moments that are unpredictable.  It is easy to watch, especially Joanna Lumley as the cranking singing coach, but fails to  leave much of an impression past the operatic pipes.
/m/falling_for_figaro	3e692c68-354c-3d67-93b7-25ef856c724a	3	It's cute. Interesting idea of mixing Opera, which is usually very sophisticated and seen as 'high class' activity, and romantic comedy.
/m/falling_for_figaro	3e692c68-354c-3d67-93b7-25ef856c724a	0.5	overall boring movie don't recommend it
/m/falling_for_figaro	3e692c68-354c-3d67-93b7-25ef856c724a	3.5	entertaining.  great singing, good story and well done.
/m/falling_for_figaro	3e692c68-354c-3d67-93b7-25ef856c724a	5	A refreshingly happy film with a fine cast, set in London and the beautiful countryside of Scotland.  Excellent cast, beautiful classical music, and an unhurried, straightforward plot that allows you to sit back and enjoy it all. Many reviews found it predictable, but  I did not. The ending was as refreshing as the rest of the film!  Brava and bravo to the two  leads!!
/m/falling_for_figaro	3e692c68-354c-3d67-93b7-25ef856c724a	5	Such a lovely laugh till you cry feel good movie!
/m/falling_for_figaro	3e692c68-354c-3d67-93b7-25ef856c724a	5	Loved this feel good rom-com!  Danielle Macdonald and Hugh Skinner have great chemistry.   Just what we need as an escape during these times
/m/demigod	51e1b35f-1b67-37e8-8988-753a6db70ee5	3	When her grandfather dies, Robin (Rachel Nichols) and Leo Murphy (Yohance Myles) return to her birthplace in Germany's Black Forest to find a terrifying secret waiting for them. Yes, as always, you should never go back home ever again.  Directed, co-written by and featuring acting by Miles Doleac (Hallowed Ground, The Dinner Party, The Historian), this movie also finds him bringing back Jeremy London from Mallrats to play Robin's grandfather in flashbacks, the kind of dude who makes kids eyeballs out of freshly killed deer.  So before you know it, three witches and the demigod Cernunnos, Lord of the Hunt, are killing everyone and anyone as they hunt the different characters in pairs. There's an awesome reveal of the demigod which brought Demonoid to mind which is — in my world — a very good thing.  I mean, this is the kind of movie that dares to start with three witches ripping a demon baby directly out of a woman's stomach. That takes some guts because how do you follow that? This is the best film I've seen Doleac create and it's a marked improvement over his previous movies.  This really surprised me. It's a quality folk horror slasher hunt movie that has some name actors and a budget used to its fullest.
/m/american_night	6e711b6d-d487-312a-a936-0ef0653e500e	4	Excellent in its genre. Loved the art theme and the wisdom pearls throughout an action packed plot.
/m/american_night	6e711b6d-d487-312a-a936-0ef0653e500e	4.5	Paz Vega was wonderful and her character was really fundamental to this film. She was the one tying together the destinies of the mafia boss Micheal Rubino and the art dealer and forger John Kaplan, leading them to a bloody and very spectacular finale. I do strongly recommend this one.
/m/american_night	6e711b6d-d487-312a-a936-0ef0653e500e	5	Loved this film. It has so many references to different form of art and kept me entertained through out. The majority of the movie is completely packed with action and had me anticipating what would happen next.
/m/american_night	6e711b6d-d487-312a-a936-0ef0653e500e	5	I just loved how incrediblily Emile Hirsch played the role of Rubino. Representing a  killer so realistically is very hard but he managed to do it perfectly, which is even scary in some way. The movie and the part could not fit him more in order to highlight how much talent he has.
/m/american_night	6e711b6d-d487-312a-a936-0ef0653e500e	4	I loved Emile Hirsch approach to this character, Micheal Rubino felt very cold but at the same time very human and relatable. I loved him and I also felt some of The Godfather's feeling in his performance. Seeing Jeremy Piven throwing shurikens while blindfolded was a pleasure. Great actor
/m/american_night	6e711b6d-d487-312a-a936-0ef0653e500e	4	I think this could become a cult movie. The actors are so great and the storytelling is just so cool. So fresh. So stylish.
/m/american_night	6e711b6d-d487-312a-a936-0ef0653e500e	3	I'm usually not very into action films but I'm an art passionate so I really enjoyed this one. The relation between art and life made this film very intriguing to me. I think that everybody will enjoy this one, some may be fascinated by the enormous amount of modern art in it, some by bullets, blood and shurikens but still you're probably going to have a great time watching this
/m/american_night	6e711b6d-d487-312a-a936-0ef0653e500e	4	I was searching for something to watch with my brothers this weekend and this was just perfect, action, tension, shooting and this very artistic background that made it all even better, I highly recommend wayching it if you want to have some fun
/m/american_night	6e711b6d-d487-312a-a936-0ef0653e500e	4.5	I don`t really know what makes this movie so good, but it might be that there is something for everyone. By that I mean that it`s not only about people shooting each other, it`s also about the value of art and love. I just can`t get over the scene where John is trying to stay conscious by remembering how Sarah makes him feel, it is SO romantic
/m/american_night	6e711b6d-d487-312a-a936-0ef0653e500e	4	Not the best movie I`ve seen in my life, but still really good. The script was definitely thought-through. The final move with the real painting was kinda unexpected which I loved. The actors did a very good job, especially Paz Vega, I loved her character
/m/survive_the_game	8db1512a-4798-3dfd-b7ac-42813a9014cb	3.5	A good duo actors awesome exellent
/m/survive_the_game	8db1512a-4798-3dfd-b7ac-42813a9014cb	0.5	Terrible. 🙈 worst acting I've seen in a hot minute
/m/survive_the_game	8db1512a-4798-3dfd-b7ac-42813a9014cb	0.5	Uau...I never thought that BW will accepted to participate in this lame, confusing, poor quality script.
/m/survive_the_game	8db1512a-4798-3dfd-b7ac-42813a9014cb	3.5	Worth a watch. I think the best performances came from Michael Sirow and Donna D'Errico. Chad Michael Murray was fine too. I enjoyed the comic relief. Storyline was a bit muddy but I followed it ok and overall enjoyed the film. Willis was a bit blah as usual but as I said I enjoyed the film overall. Pretty good and nice action. Only complaint was that katzman actress. She was trying too hard to be Harley Quinn.
/m/south_of_heaven_2021	715ca696-72c7-323e-9f8f-e49668234704	5	A wonderful movie! This movie is so touching and so surprising it stays with you for a few days after watching. Great acting by Both lead actor and actress. Great screen play directing and cinematography. Great rhythm and music. I hope it will be nominated for some big awards.
/m/south_of_heaven_2021	715ca696-72c7-323e-9f8f-e49668234704	4	It’s refreshing seeing a movie with different style and substance. Tired of the same old plot lines Hollywood churn out. Sudekis and Lilly shine and have chemistry.
/m/south_of_heaven_2021	715ca696-72c7-323e-9f8f-e49668234704	0.5	Absolutely horrendous. The plot is a mashup of piles of films and redundant references to them. The forced almost condescending performance by Jason Sudeikis as down on his luck hayseed ex-con is done so poorly as to be laughable. The strained “romantic” scenes with “the wife” (it’s hard to remember most of these characters names) elicit nothing. The BIGGEST problem… The witty and articulate villain Price. Who is black. A terribly written role to shake up stereotypes and so forced it will make your stomach rile. His lines and performance are that of a bad actor. If he’s an actor of any talent he needs to find better roles. YOU CAN NOT FORCE TBHS STUFF!!! The scene where he sits with his comatose son…. Really???? (If the filmmakers explain this and a handful of other absurd interactions s as an attempt at “odd” they are lying). Yorick anyone??The interaction between Sudeikis and the “kid”…. WHAT??? Think “now I’m watching The Toy with bizarre role reversal” for all of 10 minutes. This movie is garbage. Yet another movie for the end of the world. And LONG. Do not waste your time. The violence was the only thing done well. But in a film so convoluted and lacking of identity it doesn’t matter. In summation… Was this the story of a desperate ex-con fighting an unjust world he has just reentered to give his wife (who he’s been unable to marry since his 30’?) and now dying of lung cancer from working in the “factory” NO! (She looks great for someone on deaths door). Was this a story of redemption and renewal, the easing of racial tensions, accomplished by flipping the roles of the players? NO! Did this turn into a comedy for about 15/20 minutes while hayseed clumsily handles the kidnapped son of the high brow super villains high brow son whom he’s kidnapped? I think so…. Does the film take time to make you care about these characters? NO! There was one solid performance in this steaming pile of nonsense. Sheah Wigham plays a solid ball busting, pig of a parole officer. You know him as he’s been a top character actor for decades and has broken through into fully realized roles in the last 15 years (if you’ve watched HBO well..). It’s not enough. Even his performance doesn’t sit right among all of the flatness. And lastly if you DO waste your time with this… let me ask you? Who’s bright idea was this? Instead of just having hayseed lose the blood money he had to pickup for pig parole officer (getting away by the skin of his teeth and NO it’s not exciting), he hits a “courier” of super villain who has a larger sim of blood money with his truck???? I have to stop or my head will explode. It’s muddled, poorly written tripe. These actors COULD have been involved in a good project. But since court jesters will work on anything you get this. And if you don’t like my comments about “inclusion” well… if you have a brain and any critical faculties you’ll like this movie even less. Pick you poison!
/m/south_of_heaven_2021	715ca696-72c7-323e-9f8f-e49668234704	2	Promising start with an intriguing plot and strong casting, but the movie failed to take advantage of these and rapidly descended into B-movie terratory. There seemed to be a half-hearted attempt to turn the film into an action movie with the least realistic portrayal of gun use since Schwarzenegger's Commando. There was a ray of hope there would be a surreal Thelman and Lousie or David Lynch ending but we were even denied that. Shame of it is, Sudeikis is maturing into an actor of the calibre of Will Smith or Tom Hanks who can switch effortlessly between drama and comedy, but he won't get there if he continues working on movies like this.
/m/south_of_heaven_2021	715ca696-72c7-323e-9f8f-e49668234704	2	Sudeikis is a outstanding comedic actor, but his dramatic chops leave something to be desired in this messy crime/thriller that really loses its grip on the plot halfway though.
/m/vengeance_is_mine_2021	bee64b58-4a11-33a4-87e4-22cde54e3c6d	5	Very cool movie from start to finish. Like a a modern day silent film. and yes I agree its a dream like the others are saying.
/m/vengeance_is_mine_2021	bee64b58-4a11-33a4-87e4-22cde54e3c6d	5	The men fly when you shoot them because the ENTIRE MOVIE IS A DREAM. Cool movie, beautifully done, barely a word is spoken which makes it a cinematic experience. Yes the story is familiar but thats not the point, the brilliance is how its done and the layers it has. The violence is a fantasy of what he wants to do, its not real, and throughout it cuts to him about to commit suicide when violence is about to occur or it cuts to him imagining his wife and sometimes she even appears before or after violence. good stuff.
/m/vengeance_is_mine_2021	bee64b58-4a11-33a4-87e4-22cde54e3c6d	5	THE WHOLE FILM IS ALL A DREAM! Honestly how the 1 film critic review on this page doesn't get that the WHOLE FILM IS A DREAM is beyond me! The violence is over the top intentionally so as to tell you that this is his fantasy just before he kills himself, every time there is violence there is hint of him imagining his dead wife or images of his suicide at the opening of the film, its al there folks. This critic bozo is supposed to read into films after years of experience but instead they are oblivious.
/m/when_im_a_moth	5ea25a0a-7ac9-4ec8-8acd-bc664c0afb11	3.5	"A parable on the ambiguity of political narratives. Possibly an "un-biopic" of Hillary Rodham set in 1969 Alaska. Possibly a collective dream about a young woman with only the most abstract connection to the politician. Possibly both."  How can you not be fascinated after reading that?  In 1969, Hillary Clinton was just Hilary Rodham and she spent the summer after graduating from Wellesley by working her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez, which fired her after a few days of work and then shut down overnight when she complained about the unhealthy workplace. Then, she went to Yale Law School and this past adventure was forgotten as she entered the world of history.  Addison Timlin plays Hilary and the film is careful to never say whether or not she is the future First Lady and Secretary of State. Instead, she's just a young girl just learning to make her way in the world of men, even discovering how her speech works like a short sword against the males that she attempts to connect with.  Zachary Cotler and Magdalena Zyzak, who co-directed with Colter to write the script, also worked together on another challenging film, The Wall of Mexico. Just like that film, this one subverts the story that you expect and pushes you to confront your preconceived notions.  As the moth moves in the stages of its life, from egg to larvae, cocoon to taking flight, the path remains fixed and rigid. No matter what happens between Hilary and her temporary friends Ryohei and Mitsuru, men who live within the wreck of a ship left behind by the last tragedy that struck the town of Valdez, her life seems as if it already has been decided. Is the summer amongst the common people her last gasp at trying to change all that? Or her just realizing that she should know who the little people are before she begins to command them?  No matter how you feel about Hilary Clinton, I recommend that you watch this. There hasn't been a film like it in some time.
/m/worth	9b57f326-5be2-4772-a51b-2181ade3bb9c	2	Not what I was expecting. Now I knew it would be depressing but I did not think the acting would be so subdued. Boring and predictable.
/m/worth	9b57f326-5be2-4772-a51b-2181ade3bb9c	3.5	A well meaning and somewhat successful story about the lawyer fighting for the rights of the 9/11 survivors and their families.  One of the nations biggest tragedies continues to hurt those close to it years later.  This story is a great rallying cry to bring justice and compensate those who suffered at ground zero.  I wish the film wasn't quite so stagey.  What comes out as good and vital, could have been great and vital.  Still this is a worthy film with a story well worth telling.
/m/worth	9b57f326-5be2-4772-a51b-2181ade3bb9c	3	el tema es interesante 6/10
/m/worth	9b57f326-5be2-4772-a51b-2181ade3bb9c	3	For a film given such lacklustre marketing, 'Worth' is worthy of seeking out purely for the relevant story and Keaton's engrossing performance as a lawyer tasked with the impossible.
/m/worth	9b57f326-5be2-4772-a51b-2181ade3bb9c	4.5	I've never reviewed a movie but I felt compelled to rate this one. Very powerful storyline and performance from Michael Keaton.
/m/worth	9b57f326-5be2-4772-a51b-2181ade3bb9c	4	Worth is an extremely effective piece of storytelling. Complex, nuanced drama that tackles big subjects with grace and intelligence. In short the title comes from the idea of 'What is a life worth?', in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. It's the true story of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. Michael Keaton stars as lawyer Kenneth Feinberg, who is appointed to head up the fund. The fund is designed to compensate the families of 9/11 victims, rather than them engaging in costly and possibly unsuccessful lawsuits. He has 2 years to convince 80% to accept the offers on the table. He also has the difficult task on placing a value on each victim's lives. Of course the drama here is between the dry calculations of the law and the open and painful feelings of the victims' families. It makes for delicate and substantial conversation as the film peers into the lives of enormous tragedy. What makes the film so effective is that it goes about its business with grace and humility. There aren't many moments of grandstanding, but rather a quiet accumulation of stories of pain. Keaton and Stanley Tucci are perfectly suited to ther lead roles. Their experience and pathos add gravitas to each scene they are in. It makes for a very impressive film, a film of effortlessly great acting and succinct and empathetic writing.
/m/worth	9b57f326-5be2-4772-a51b-2181ade3bb9c	5	If Michael Keaton's portrait does not win the Oscar for the best actor, then we have to a proof that Oscars is a farce as usual blunders when selection.
/m/worth	9b57f326-5be2-4772-a51b-2181ade3bb9c	2.5	Too much cheap emotional manipulation for Blobbo's taste, for one thing. (There are others.)
/m/worth	9b57f326-5be2-4772-a51b-2181ade3bb9c	4	I personally don't know any of the victims or their families that were impacted by 9/11, but I would be curious to see what they thought about this film. I thought it was a great but simultaneously depressing film about one of the most horrible tragedies to occur in the world. These people lost a loved one, have so many questions about what happened and why wasn't a better job done of preventing it in the first place, then you have the government and the airline industry rushing to change a law so that the victim's families don't file a lawsuit...it's just a wide range of things that the victims had to deal with, and continue to deal with, and I thought the film did a great job of showing this all. For me, Michael Keaton is just one of the best actors around, and of course the rest of the cast was superb as well. I highly recommend this move.
/m/worth	9b57f326-5be2-4772-a51b-2181ade3bb9c	3	The story is far fetched, quite obvious still but probably one of the nice ones for September.
/m/the_nowhere_inn	6ef3efe3-13a2-4bbb-ae32-942a016b77a1	5	This was the greatest movie I have ever seen on every level
/m/the_nowhere_inn	6ef3efe3-13a2-4bbb-ae32-942a016b77a1	4	I really enjoyed this mockumentary. I will start with the obvious: the live performances footage is beautifully filmed, focusing on the little gestures and stage shenanigangs that all St Vincent fans have come to love.   I think it's a brave "performance" of St Vincent since development-wise her character is not portrayed in the nicest light possible, so to speak. Obviously it's clear to everyone that it's, yes, a mockumentary, but still, I'm pretty impressed with her acting. The touches of humor are really good and I LOVED the vibe of the first scene in the movie, I just wished there would have been a bit more of that.   If you enjoy meta-movies related to music and you are familiar with the work of CB and St Vincent, it's a very enjoyable movie with lovely imperfections.
/m/the_nowhere_inn	6ef3efe3-13a2-4bbb-ae32-942a016b77a1	3.5	I didnt know a thing about st Vincent coming into this but she seems like a down to earth person. I wouldn’t consider this a documentary at all, it was just a fun film 3.5
/m/the_nowhere_inn	6ef3efe3-13a2-4bbb-ae32-942a016b77a1	5	If you like Portlandia, True Stories (Talking Heads) and Spinal Tap you may love this movie. Instant Cult Classic! I laughed I cried.  " Better than Star Wars better than E.T. "
/m/the_nowhere_inn	6ef3efe3-13a2-4bbb-ae32-942a016b77a1	3.5	“This is how actors play rock stars in movies.” St. Vincent sets out to make a documentary about her music, but when she hires a close friend to direct, notions of reality, identity, and authenticity grow increasingly distorted and bizarre. The Nowhere Inn is an absurd, comedic, and thriller that I’m still trying to wrap my head around. It’s hard to pinpoint the genre, but whatever it is, it’s working. This played apart of the midnight selection at Sundance 2020, and I remember it looked interesting (all of the midnight ones did that year) but I didn’t understand what it was about. Even watching the trailer, it barely covers what it’s about. St. Vincent (Annie Clark) and her real life friend Carrie Brownstein wrote and starred in the movie, of course. They have this amazing chemistry that didn’t need any building beforehand. Everything you see is genuine. Though they’re playing themselves, they have a unique character that we know isn’t how it’s like in real life. St. Vincent does fantastic with the transformation she goes through. It’s so fun to watch her go through it all. And Carrie Brownstein, who I haven’t really seen much before has really good acting skills. Had those two not been cast in their own movie, and I’m not sure if they originally started out writing themselves in, I don’t think they could’ve pulled it off. The story is extremely satirical. Once you start to realize what the movie is about, and it makes a point to it, you can see some of what will unfold. It pokes fun at documentaries and rockstars and performers and they way it’s done is really cool and fun. When you consider the movie as a whole, then it gets a little more confusing. It’s like a movie within a movie within a movie (I think that’s right). What we mainly see is a mockumentary style story. There’s different aspect ratios and styles to differentiate what story or movie we’re focusing on. And the cinematography is pretty good. There’s sequences shot on film, mostly the concerts, that are beautiful to look at. And it’s edited really well. There are many achievements to be noted. With how trippy it is, it can be hard to figure out what the movie is trying to say. But that’s also a point made in the movie where someone says something along the lines of “I don’t think she really understood the movie we were making.” A little more clarity would’ve helped, but I like having the mystery there. For a little bit the same things keep happening and I wanted a little more variety. It’s one of those things where I thought they’d move on and show something else, but they keep going back to it. As a character, it’s frustrating for Carrie but she lets it happen for some time. Nevertheless, this is a really fun movie. I was in the middle of watching it when my apartment building had a power outage so I had to watch it in halves. You need to be attentive and ready for anything when watching. By the end it goes completely off the rails and I’m not sure how to interpret it. Maybe a little more reading will help. Overall, The Nowhere Inn is a surprising movie that I would like to revisit again. It does land with everything, but for a psychological movie (that’s the genre I’m going with) it has great craft and great start for Bill Benz to make more movies!
/m/the_nowhere_inn	6ef3efe3-13a2-4bbb-ae32-942a016b77a1	5	Love St Vincent, very hilarious mockumentary and even funnier bit with Dakota Johnson
/m/the_nowhere_inn	6ef3efe3-13a2-4bbb-ae32-942a016b77a1	5	I absolutely loved this film, I was laughing so hard at the absurdity of it all. It has a very psychedelic feel to it, but still manages to focus on a plot, which is constantly twisting and turning. The whole concept they created of mocking a tour film is genius and who better to do it then Carrie and Annie- both being fantastic musicians who have a long history of touring.  The cinematography was top notch and both Carrie and Annie were performing at their absolute best, I enjoyed every minute ❤️  Go see this movie, you won't regret it.
/m/the_nowhere_inn	6ef3efe3-13a2-4bbb-ae32-942a016b77a1	3	It's as if Andy Warhol and Andy Kauffman got together to write the character St. Vincent and then they found a college graduate who loves David Lynch movies to direct the picture. It was hard to watch at times and is more of a fake-u-mentary. Her music I still find to be bland after watching the movie. Loved the texas scene.
/m/the_nowhere_inn	6ef3efe3-13a2-4bbb-ae32-942a016b77a1	4	I found this to be a hilarious dark comedy.  I'm glad I saw it, but the ending didn't tie things up in a satisfying enough way for me to give this 5 stars.
/m/the_nowhere_inn	6ef3efe3-13a2-4bbb-ae32-942a016b77a1	4.5	Okay, some background to my position vis-a-vis this movie: I have been to 2 St Vincent concerts and I loved her work since the first album. At the first concert I went to circa Actor, I went by myself, I was in my late 20s, and that era of St Vincent in concert was loose and classic rock concerty. There was eventually an extended moment where Annie shredded her guitar on her knees by a monitor out on the apron of the stage and I had a sort of cosmic epiphany about feminism and the planet. It's not really effable, so I'm gonna leave it at that. But I guess what I'm trying to say with that is: I understand from a specific place the desire for a St Vincent concert film. At the second concert (eponymous album tour) in London, we walked into our balcony seats and there was one seat that was reserved with a sign for "CARRIE BROWNSTEIN" and my partner and I were like !!!! THE Carrie Brownstein?! And sure enough, just before curtain THAT Carrie Brownstein showed up and sat, for about half the time. And one dude walked up to her and she was clearly polite to him, and then a few more, and I knew I did not want to join that crowd, so I did not attempt to say hello or have a selfie with Carrie Brownstein. That second concert was so much more choreographed than the first one I went to.  And all that brings me to this movie. Which I really like. I haven't read "professional" reviews yet, but I've seen headlines along the lines of "doesn't hold together" and "too many ideas" and sure, it definitely gets very shaggy near the end. But I think it would be really interesting to survey the genders of those reviewers, because something about this film's concerns with selfhood and celebrity and human connection are, I think, *saturated* in gender considerations. It is a deeply feminine problem to have to agonize over whether being nice or being a Bitch is the worse choice. The shagginess, the zig-zagging camp to camp horror to mind-bending surrealism to Lynchian red curtains all just work for me as a pretty straightforward (I mean, haha) analogy of the minefield that is being a person, a persona, a self, entangled with other selves close and far.
/m/the_killing_of_kenneth_chamberlain	c1962da5-4039-4248-9205-2d1471d0688b	3.5	Sad, another case of a black person being abused by police. Happens everyday.
/m/the_killing_of_kenneth_chamberlain	c1962da5-4039-4248-9205-2d1471d0688b	5	Fantastic film.  So difficult to create suspense in a two room set.  Sad to watch, but well worth it.
/m/the_killing_of_kenneth_chamberlain	c1962da5-4039-4248-9205-2d1471d0688b	5	This film is exceptional in both form and content. The pacing continues to escalate to the climax without a wasted moment. The audience's vantage point of seeing both the victim's perspective (inside the door) and the perpetrators' perspective (outside the door) leaves the viewer aggravated at the obtuseness and miscommunication that led to such a tragic crime. The most similar film that comes to mind is Fruitvale Station, but the claustrophobic nature of "The Killing of Kenneth Chamberlain" will drive you deeper and deeper into the narrative to the point where you feel like you're in it and want to do something to resolve the unfortunate situation these characters find themselves in. Until sadly, you realize these aren't characters. This tragedy really happened, to a real person by the hands of real people. The message certainly has a political element to it, but unlike the many films that sacrifice form for content, this film executes (for lack of a better term). One wonders what the impact at the end would have been if the end wasn't given away in the title, but other than that, watching this film was time well spent.
/m/the_killing_of_kenneth_chamberlain	c1962da5-4039-4248-9205-2d1471d0688b	5	Easily one of the best films of 2021. Such a tragic story! It was told so well with believable performances, great direction, a great score and so much more. I got to interview the creators on my YouTube channel - Anthony A. Perez
/m/the_killing_of_kenneth_chamberlain	c1962da5-4039-4248-9205-2d1471d0688b	4.5	This was so frustrating to watch. How horrible cops can be, it's disgusting. Thank God they're not all like the couple of bad ones in this movie that's based on a true story. Frankie Faison is a great actor and did a tremendous job portraying Kenneth. I was glad it was a short movie because it made me very angry.
/m/the_killing_of_kenneth_chamberlain	c1962da5-4039-4248-9205-2d1471d0688b	3.5	While liberties are taken in films that are based on true stories.  A subject this polarizing shouldn't really be speculated on as much as it is here.  But from a technical aspect, it was well done.
/m/the_killing_of_kenneth_chamberlain	c1962da5-4039-4248-9205-2d1471d0688b	5	This was the most riveting film I have seen in a long time. It clearly illustrates why we need to defund this bullshit.
/m/the_killing_of_kenneth_chamberlain	c1962da5-4039-4248-9205-2d1471d0688b	4	Lacking in finesse--a little blunt in parts, particularly with regards the offending officer--but a truly moving film. If this is an accurate representation of the "black experience", then it fills me with sadness. The director really manages to capture the antagonism and miscommunication between parties, and build a sense of dread.
/m/the_killing_of_kenneth_chamberlain	c1962da5-4039-4248-9205-2d1471d0688b	5	This is a brilliant movie.  Everyone should see this movie.   This heartbreaking and infuriating story, that happened in White Plains, NY. People really need to see this movie.  It makes really important statements about the danger of having police on medical calls and dealing with people with mental health problems.  You can see how it goes from being a "welfare check up" to the police deciding he "might be committing some crime" though he is in his late 70's and it is 5 AM.  This is everything you don't want to see in policing and tragic.  It's been a long road to get this independent movie into theaters.  Please support this film and go see it.  If you can't go to a theater and see it, you can stream it.
/m/the_killing_of_kenneth_chamberlain	c1962da5-4039-4248-9205-2d1471d0688b	5	A must see movie loved it !!!
/m/this_is_the_year	2b18b2e2-7986-3d41-a6c6-7c73be747832	1.5	This Is The Year really borrows hard from other more well made road trip teen comedies, but doesn´t know how to bring anything refreshing to the table, with poorly constructed characters and a predictable story.
/m/this_is_the_year	2b18b2e2-7986-3d41-a6c6-7c73be747832	4	Little slow but pleasant.  For some reason did not play best LovelytheBand songs
/m/this_is_the_year	2b18b2e2-7986-3d41-a6c6-7c73be747832	5	A true nod to the bodacious 80's movies we all learned to love, THIS IS THE YEAR brings an often told story to life on screen with humor, expertly directed shots by director David Henrie (Wizards of Waverly Place) and a cast of standout talent. (Not to mention somewhat of a WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE reunion with Selena Gomez producing, Gregg Sulkin as Kale and Jeff Garlin as Mr. Elmer.)   Lorenzo James Henrie (Fear the Walking Dead) plays Josh with earnest puppy-dog eyed optimism. Molly (Vanessa Marano - Gilmore Girls) is the true wing man...erm...wing woman to Josh's antics.   Marano is quite possibly the most captivating in the film, drawing you into every scene she graces. Her comedic timing allows her to volley back and forth with the entire cast, including the hilarious BroadwayWorld Award Winner Josh Rhett Noble (Law & Order: SVU, TIME: The Kalief Browder Story) seen in a comedic cameo as grumpy "patron" Jared. (Whom we assume must just live at the theater.)   The rest of the cast does a stellar job teetering between the over-the-top tubular antics you'd expect in 80's classics but grounding the scenes with truth. Alyssa Jirrels (The Good Doctor, Girl Meets World) is especially good at this as Zoey, bringing an affable and endearing portrayal to what would usually be the one dimensional "hot girl". Same goes for Jake Short (A.N.T. Farm) who brings his character of Mikey to life with ease.   It may be a love tale as old as time, but if you find yourself "jonesing" for a great classic escape, THIS IS THE YEAR has got it. TOTALLY!
/m/this_is_the_year	2b18b2e2-7986-3d41-a6c6-7c73be747832	5	This is a fun movie in the tradition of classic teen movies such as the Breakfast Club.
/m/this_is_the_year	2b18b2e2-7986-3d41-a6c6-7c73be747832	5	This was such a good family fun film. I saw so many young girls there with their Moms. The writers made it fun and respectful which is hard to find for my daughters where I don't have to cringe when things happen. PS the soundtrack is actually really good. Jeff Garlin was very funny and good in a limited role. My girls loved the girls acting in the film. Thanks to David Henrie ! Good job !
/m/this_is_the_year	2b18b2e2-7986-3d41-a6c6-7c73be747832	5	I think this was a really fun movie to watch. Funny, likable and relatable characters, took me on an adventure and brought back really good memories of my own. I will definitely watch it again, probably tonight LOL.
/m/this_is_the_year	2b18b2e2-7986-3d41-a6c6-7c73be747832	5	I just streamed this and have all the nostalgic feels! Lorenzo Henrie does a banging job playing Josh. And Vanessa Marano (one of my faves) steals every scene she is in as Molly. I'd pay to see an entire spin off with her just screaming at Jared (Josh Rhett Noble) in the theater. What a fun escape.
/m/cinderella_2021	c4fbb673-9752-3c33-8b77-e782c2f6ecb6	5	I loved it. A refreshing, fun take on a story that's been done many times before. So glad I decided to ignore the negativity, as it was really enjoyable!

/m/cinderella_2021	c4fbb673-9752-3c33-8b77-e782c2f6ecb6	1	Feels like it was written by that high school science teacher that tries to connect with the kids by rapping the periodic table. I don't use this word lightly, but this movie is cringey. Most of the covers are terrible. The song choices are just so out of place. Of course, Idina Menzel and Billy Porter sounds amazing but everyone else sounds awful. The Am I Wrong cover is especially egregious.

/m/cinderella_2021	c4fbb673-9752-3c33-8b77-e782c2f6ecb6	1	Misfire. Misfire. Misfire. I mean, this was so unnecessary...to say the least. Why is politics forcing itself into entertainment!?  And entertainment aimed at a younger audience at that? This was way too "progressive" for me and truly do wonder what people in the future will be saying about this and the unrealistic and naive narrative. You fancy a really good remake of this classic loved story? Ever After with Barry Drewmore is dreamy in comparison to this. What a shame!
/m/cinderella_2021	c4fbb673-9752-3c33-8b77-e782c2f6ecb6	2	Streamed this movie and even with fast forwarding through big chunks of it it still felt like it was 5 hours long. Some great production/dance numbers and a fantastic look but the rest was a snooze

Add Nicolas Cage with a perennial grin on his face and a testicle in his hand and you're still far from surprises.
/m/the_auschwitz_report	c4c2371f-bfcc-4e52-a728-a775f0fd461f	4	Infelizmente trata-se de uma história baseada em fatos reais que descreve eventos quase cruéis de mais para serem verdade. Na época os fatos relatados pelos 2 protagonistas foram desacreditados por este exato motivo.
/m/the_auschwitz_report	c4c2371f-bfcc-4e52-a728-a775f0fd461f	0.5	Instead of blowing up Auschwitz, it blew hot air. I was confused by "The Report". I didn't really enjoy this movie much as it made the point of "obliterating" an internment camp "to smithereens". While the speaker led into the movie that "every day felt like 100 years", the "Day 1 through 11" should've been shorted down to a day or two in efforts to make this movie more tense and believable; I can't really say that a couple of men would survive in a makeshift foxhole without defecating or fighting for food or personality conflicts about destroying the camp, let alone trying to dig their way out sideways in efforts to escape being trapped under more wood. Others, should've tried feeding them while in the foxhole, but it seemed they didn't care for their own men. In the end when they finally met the Red Cross, while 'heroic' is they were trying to appear to be, them begging for the destruction of everyone was pretty genocidal. Seeing a fellow Slovak lady shot in the head because someone from a different barrack wasn't cooperating was ironically a 'buzz-kill' for a Czechoslovakian like myself. The way they simply gave up looking for the missing two and slowly carried the film made it dull at this point. The general had more character development because of the loss of his son and thus ailing wife; as they didn't want to be part of this war or apart. In all, the prisoners of war never revolted, as they kept bragging on about, selfishly leading up to their friend being solely shot when attacking the general. During the questionnaire, I had asked if damaging the supply routes the Red Cross had, would've doomed the internment camp into starvation, and was told "No.", which was the whole point of why the Red Cross was interviewing the two, to see if the supplies ever made it, to which they denied. It doesn't seem much thought was placed into the film to try and make the general a bad person, rather than a prisoner of his own internal war. While I've seen all the Hogan's Heroes episodes, this movie is a far cry from making much sense. I wish we had more time for questions at the end, as others wished to speak. I was going to finally view the rest of the museum this past weekend, but my friend was told not to let me return by disgruntled security. Weird, since I was overly polite and respectful. It was mentioned they would not exempt my medical condition, again. Ouch for second chances.
/m/wild_indian	b462fb96-b691-49b9-a1b0-a00e81ba43c2	1	A Indian teenager while walking in the woods with a friend hunting  shoots and kills a third teenager in a daydream moment. The friend assists the shooter in covering up the murder. The shooter leaves the reservation and makes a success of himself. His friend deals with his guilt by going in and out of prison for 25 years. Eventually he follows (his friend) the shooter to California and tries to kill him with a pistol to appease his own guilt. The bullet only grazes his friends arm. He has a change of heart and puts the gun down giving the intended victim the chance to pick up the gun and promptly shoot his previously threatening friend dead. He is acquitted and then travels to the beach where centuries earlier an ancestor also healed himself. The End.  The filmography , editing and acting are fine. Who cares?  The story is about nothing. At least a Seinfeld rerun might make you laugh. This on the other hand really is nothing.
/m/wild_indian	b462fb96-b691-49b9-a1b0-a00e81ba43c2	3	Rating: B-  "Wild Indian is a strong feature directorial debut from Lyle Mitchell Corbine Jr., who I recommend following closely for the next few years. Boasting a compelling narrative, Michael Greyeyes and Chaske Spencer take the viewers through a dark, emotional journey of understanding that life isn't always fair and that making amends only works for people who can actually feel guilt or remorse. Both actors offer notable performances, but it's Spencer who really impacts me at an emotional level, elevating the only character I truly cared about. On the other hand, the protagonist is an incredibly unlikeable person who tries his hardest to forget the tragic past through deplorable actions. Jesse Eisenberg sadly sticks out like a sore thumb. The short runtime partially compensates for the slow pacing, but overall I still had a good time."
/m/wild_indian	b462fb96-b691-49b9-a1b0-a00e81ba43c2	1	Garbage. 90 minutes of solid movie only to end it with nothing. Garbage
/m/wild_indian	b462fb96-b691-49b9-a1b0-a00e81ba43c2	4	Michael Greyeyes is a real standout here as a trouble disturbed psychopath dealing with issues from the past in his needy new life. Its wonderfully directed, but also dwells into the philosophical with its themes and a culture we should know more about.
/m/wild_indian	b462fb96-b691-49b9-a1b0-a00e81ba43c2	5	Very emotional movie, Micheal Greyeyes is a wonderful performer, and the story is actually a common one for those of us born into that lifestyle. I think everyone should take a trip into this world, just for perspective. All four thumbs up here
/m/wild_indian	b462fb96-b691-49b9-a1b0-a00e81ba43c2	3	The fine performances compensate for the very dreary story, admittedly worth telling.

/m/best_sellers	b4591db7-6ca1-4d78-942a-e820ff541a70	5	Definitivamente (y al parecer al contrario de lo que la mayoría opina acá) este es mi estilo de película favorito. Un argumento profundo, con una narrativa sólida, una actuación destacada (especialmente de Michael Caine) y un desarrollo y desenlace que termina siendo edificante. Muy, muy recomendable.
/m/best_sellers	b4591db7-6ca1-4d78-942a-e820ff541a70	3	Aubrey plaza is so under appreciated 2.8
/m/best_sellers	b4591db7-6ca1-4d78-942a-e820ff541a70	5	Michael Caine was incredible as the drunken, broken and dispirited artist.  His brilliant performance was equally met by Aubrey Plaza who countered his darkness with a youthful and hopeful exuberance.  What really set this film apart for me was the exceptional screenwriting.  Anthony Grieco beautifully blends their stories eliciting real and heartfelt emotions from the.   He couples that with finding the perfect moments to inject some wit or even crass humour thereby lightening moments and helping reset perspective.  Lina Roessler does a tremendous job bringing this all together.  Loved the film...Thanks for this!
/m/best_sellers	b4591db7-6ca1-4d78-942a-e820ff541a70	3	Needs more Caine - Plaza weirdness

/m/best_sellers	b4591db7-6ca1-4d78-942a-e820ff541a70	2.5	Michael Caine was his usual character -a true reprobate-  His supporting cast was totally miscast -They did nothing to support either the story  or his character-

/m/best_sellers	b4591db7-6ca1-4d78-942a-e820ff541a70	4	Michael Caine and Aubrey Plaza are superb together in this formulaic but wildly entertaining look at forgotten glory, that strikes the right balance of funny and emotional. I had a good time with this !
/m/the_colony_2021	b4f72727-c28e-3e00-afdb-49a74977fe5c	5	A good Science Fiction advancement...very modern.
/m/the_colony_2021	b4f72727-c28e-3e00-afdb-49a74977fe5c	5	Loved it. Actors are amazing and although the premise is an old one, it's a realistic take on what the world would be like should climate change take its toll. Its tempered look and feel is perfect and enables main character Blake to be a badass without being a trope. The women in this are compelling, the men a bit overcooked, but all round a great movie.
/m/the_colony_2021	b4f72727-c28e-3e00-afdb-49a74977fe5c	1.5	Very dark, dirty, depressing, and gloomy.  Virtually every scene is underlit. The acting was good, the practical effects and sets functioned well.  The script was basic and the exposition was sporadic but abundant enough to let the viewer know what was happening.   For me, it was WAY too dystopian. The depressing mood was hammered constantly and the dingy and dirty wetness was overwhelming.
/m/the_colony_2021	b4f72727-c28e-3e00-afdb-49a74977fe5c	4.5	I enjoyed the film.
/m/the_colony_2021	b4f72727-c28e-3e00-afdb-49a74977fe5c	2	Meh.    So dystopian future, we suck as humans, destroyed the world, left for an entire other planet in Kelper 209, and have sent some folks back after 2 generations have been produced-  so roughly let's say 100 years-- yet we still only use 1960 technology in the space pod despite all these advances.  In addition, you have to accept in destroying the Earth we somehow destroyed all land and continents.   This is if Waterworld (without the budget) and Children of Men had a low grade baby film that wasn't fully thought out.  Characters have no emotions, to hard to justify emotional swings, to no justification choices, to just move the dang plot along choices.  It tries somewhat hard to justify somethings, but others not so much.  And in the end, it has a meh climax, and unexplainable knowledge of certain things - 'mud' woman knows English and CPR, but entire tribe just destroys things in a spaceship like cavemen.  So it passed the time, but really failed to impress. Feel free to watch, but know it won't be one to remember by next week.

/m/last_night_in_rozzie	deb2632d-a283-3b51-a966-637095a96161	4.5	This movie stayed with me for days.  The acting was convincing and believable (including the kids.) Kudos to the writer and director. This was their first feature and they kept it very real and honest.  I'm looking forward to seeing what they will do next.
/m/last_night_in_rozzie	deb2632d-a283-3b51-a966-637095a96161	5	"Rozzie" is a character-driven story--gritty and dramatic, threaded with humor. As someone who grew up in a similar urban neighborhood, I recognize these people: the lifelong resident who's loyal to a fault but the victim of his own self-destruction. The one who "got out," but still bears scars. The devoted single mother who took her future in hand for the sake of her son. The acting is high-caliber: Jeremy Sisto (whom I first loved in "Six Feet Under"), as the damaged townie who won't go down easy. Neil Brown Jr. (whom I recognized from "Insecure"), as the high-functioning lawyer with his own hard secrets. And Nicky Whelan, previously unknown to me, but believable as the level-headed mom who sees through them both. There are some intense scenes—and a final reveal about that "last night in Rozzie," still triggering emotional repercussions years later—but ultimately it's a film about guilt and redemption, intergenerational trauma and breaking the cycle of harm. Give it a try—it's a remarkable feat produced on a small budget, the best of what independent filmmaking offers us. Oh—and don't look for a Boston accent: the filmmakers (wisely) seem to understand that there's nothing worse than the many bad ones out there.
/m/last_night_in_rozzie	deb2632d-a283-3b51-a966-637095a96161	5	At some point we all have to reconcile with events of our past.   But what if those events are irreconcilable?  Last Night In Rozzie presents such a situation.   The premise seems straight forward: Ronnie, a successful lawyer in NYC, has been summoned to Boston by Joey, his best friend from childhood.  Joey is on his deathbed and makes what appears to be a  simple request: for Ronnie to arrange for Joey's estranged 10 year old son to visit him before Joey dies.  However some things tied to events of the past are not that simple.  And Ronnie ends up making huge sacrifices in an attempt to complete this task.   But what he really accomplishes is so much more than what we are initially led to believe.    Last Night In Rozzie is one of those great films that keeps you thinking long after the movie is over.  This is because of its kaleidoscope effect: every time you revisit it, you have a different view.   And each view becomes more meaningful and deeper.   I dare not say more without revealing too much of the film.  But I highly recommend it.
/m/last_night_in_rozzie	deb2632d-a283-3b51-a966-637095a96161	5	Powerful movie with well timed themes of  addiction and mental health impacting relationships and the power of healing.  It's a well written, emotionally charged story with great acting.  Definitely worth a watch.
/m/last_night_in_rozzie	deb2632d-a283-3b51-a966-637095a96161	5	Loved it. Great film!
/m/last_night_in_rozzie	deb2632d-a283-3b51-a966-637095a96161	2	Implausible script from start to finish. Really not worth your time or money.
/m/last_night_in_rozzie	deb2632d-a283-3b51-a966-637095a96161	1.5	At least make the effort to find actors who can attempt a Mass accent. This is lazy filmmaking. This made for tv flick just isn't authentic. Start with actors who sound like they are from Rossi. It doesn't take a brain trust.
/m/last_night_in_rozzie	deb2632d-a283-3b51-a966-637095a96161	4.5	The writing was great.  Highly recommend the film. A couple surprises in an expected storyline added a fresh take. Thoroughly enjoyed the actors.
/m/last_night_in_rozzie	deb2632d-a283-3b51-a966-637095a96161	4	Decent. And worth a shot for anyone interested in indie film.

/m/we_need_to_do_something	d0998cec-3b5f-46bd-a784-b5da5430568c	1	This movie doesn't even know what it is, pacing is off, and it just struggles to keep moving.  It took me around 5 tries to watch it all the way through - I kept falling asleep.
/m/we_need_to_do_something	d0998cec-3b5f-46bd-a784-b5da5430568c	2.5	But nobody really did anything except be pitiful in a pink bathroom. Somehow they weave some witchery into it all and it gets slashier with each flashback.
/m/we_need_to_do_something	d0998cec-3b5f-46bd-a784-b5da5430568c	4	Great movie, although I’m not sure I thought so as I was watching it. Excellent ending, even if it irked me in the moment. It’s not until it was finished and I had time to wrap my brain around what I just watched that I truly understood just how messed up, fun, and scary this movie was.
/m/we_need_to_do_something	d0998cec-3b5f-46bd-a784-b5da5430568c	4	I have a new favorite actor, and his name is Pat Healy!
/m/we_need_to_do_something	d0998cec-3b5f-46bd-a784-b5da5430568c	0.5	There's not enough time in the day to write about all the things critically wrong with this movie. My first impression was that it felt very similar to a story that should have been a half-hour episode of Tales of the Darkside from the 80s.  But that's mostly because it was horribly written and incoherent. And the snake looked like it came from the Walmart toy aisle. But I guess this really is where we are as a culture: these unbelievable, irrational scenarios that make zero sense and contain no type of logical narrative at all…just some blood and craziness. Oh, and as long as there are some young lesbians we can just create a film that literally makes no sense and follows no specific plot line. Wow. That was just bad. Really, really bad. IFC should be embarrassed and should apologize for playing any role in allowing it to be made.
/m/we_need_to_do_something	d0998cec-3b5f-46bd-a784-b5da5430568c	0.5	Words cannot describe how sorry you'll feel once you realized that you've unwittingly sacrificed 90 Precious Minutes of your Life for a "Film" of this caliber & low intrinsic worth.
/m/we_need_to_do_something	d0998cec-3b5f-46bd-a784-b5da5430568c	4	Maybe we don't need to do something.  A new IFC claustrophobic horror. A family got stuck in a bathroom trying to avoid the storm. Paranoia started as the family broke down.  Although it started slow, when that one scene hits, oh shit I got spooked. I became very on edge from that point on until the end. Stuff just got crazier and crazier as characters became more unhinged. There was a good amount of gore, which added to the sense of paranoia that was immersed throughout the room.   Since the movie took place in a bathroom and only filmed for 17 days, it just showed how effective and efficient the director used the concept and the tight budget. Not a lot was shown, but instead the movie used sound to stimulate the audience's imagination of what happened outside the room.  Overall, an effective claustrophobic horror. 8/10
/m/we_need_to_do_something	d0998cec-3b5f-46bd-a784-b5da5430568c	4	A claustrophobic, dark, and suspenseful horror film. Loved every second if it. Sierra McCormick and Vinessa Shaw were fantastic.
/m/we_need_to_do_something	d0998cec-3b5f-46bd-a784-b5da5430568c	1.5	Freakiest movie I’ve ever seen. I left midway through. The language was off-the-chain vulgar. The homosexuality love story, mixed with witchcraft with whatever was going on in this tense,  unnerving film with characters that were far from lovable was to much for me.
/m/we_need_to_do_something	d0998cec-3b5f-46bd-a784-b5da5430568c	4	Crazy movie. The actors in this film are great, esp. the guy who plays the dad.

/m/dating_and_new_york	eace1633-5f89-377b-9720-609a0dd01ec2	0.5	This is probably the worst film I've ever seen. How is the writer/director/cringe cameo not a boomer? I'm a millennial and this feels like an excruciating attempt to describe gen z dating by someone who met their soulmate in middle school 40 years ago. The first line/premise of almost every conversation in this film feels like an observation from When Harry Met Sally that is so out of date, so obvious and so easy that blowing out the premise into an entire conversation in 2021 is stunning. It's SO out of touch it's unbelievable. You can also feel the lack of a script throughout the entire film. Every scene feels half written, as if the writer knew he was casting a comedian (Jaboukie) so he just came up with beats for the scene and relied on the actors to essentially improvise the entire movie. The relationship between the two leads is pretty much just them bickering about the premise of the film that they are in for the entire film. Nothing else happens. They just talk and talk and talk about the fact that they're hooking up but not together. AND YET THEY NEVER HOOK UP. By no means am I longing for a sex scene, but literally all these people do is walk around New York. They genuinely just feel like friends. The film is so low budget there are almost no establishing shots, which creates an incredibly surreal, claustrophobic viewing experience. You can feel it being shot in 5 days. There's a scene where Jaboukie is at a spa getting a mud mask plastered onto his face and the goop slowly creeps closer and closer to his eyeball with every cut back. Which is just so hilariously amateur. The only redeeming part of the film is the scene where Catherine Cohen and her boyfriend go to view an apartment and he asks her to move in together. We even see their wedding and we don't get a shot of her walking down the aisle from the front. Only from her back. Like...??? I needed the dress reveal! There are SO many frames/takes in this film that are just so insanely amateur that only a totally self financed person could have made this movie. Who paid for this??? Who in 2021 would read this script and spend the money to hire a Daily Show correspondent and SAG actors and an entire film crew?? But we all know that this "auteur" will fail upwards and have a show on Hulu or Netflix or something by 2022.
/m/dating_and_new_york	eace1633-5f89-377b-9720-609a0dd01ec2	5	My diverse group of 18-35 year old friends all watched this over the weekend and loved it. perfect modern day romcom for the new generation of 18-35 year olds.
/m/dating_and_new_york	eace1633-5f89-377b-9720-609a0dd01ec2	5	Amazing movie with a stellar performance. Perfect movie for casual watching.
/m/dating_and_new_york	eace1633-5f89-377b-9720-609a0dd01ec2	5	A cute, lighthearted, fun movie!
/m/dating_and_new_york	eace1633-5f89-377b-9720-609a0dd01ec2	4	I was very pleasantly surprised by Dating & New York.  The film captures the zeitgeist of the pre-pandemic NY.  (It's going to be fun to look back at this movie in 5 years to see how much has changed in the dating world, and even the world itself!) The word that springs to mind is BREEZY.  The city looks great, the score is lush, the chemistry abundant.   Extremely watchable!
/m/lady_of_the_manor	4b19a75c-24c2-30ad-aa7f-bb1356b8a69f	1	Boring and a waste of time
/m/lady_of_the_manor	4b19a75c-24c2-30ad-aa7f-bb1356b8a69f	2	Disappointing, I think the cast was great but the plot could have been more exciting. Justin Long is a legend and his character was just not used enough. Overall, I wish I could return this movie to the video store or movie theater and get my 85 minutes of my life back.
/m/lady_of_the_manor	4b19a75c-24c2-30ad-aa7f-bb1356b8a69f	2	Not really sure what they were thinking with this movie, but might barley pass the time for you.
/m/lady_of_the_manor	4b19a75c-24c2-30ad-aa7f-bb1356b8a69f	5	Great feel good movie
/m/lady_of_the_manor	4b19a75c-24c2-30ad-aa7f-bb1356b8a69f	0.5	This has to be one of the worst supposed comedy films I have ever seen. Its crass, badly written and the plot is about as thin as it gets. How on earth are films like this ever get to see the light of day beats me.
/m/lady_of_the_manor	4b19a75c-24c2-30ad-aa7f-bb1356b8a69f	0.5	Disappointingly boring and neither clever nor funny. It felt like it teetered between a corny 90's teen Nick movie and National Lampoon. The main character is an uninteresting slob, which is the point of relationship between her and the dead "lady". But she's just a sorry, dumb loser. It took me two nights to agonize through watching it, since I regrettably paid for it.
/m/lady_of_the_manor	4b19a75c-24c2-30ad-aa7f-bb1356b8a69f	4	Funny movie. The actors were great at there parts.
/m/lady_of_the_manor	4b19a75c-24c2-30ad-aa7f-bb1356b8a69f	3	Not as funny as I had hoped it would be.  The outtakes at the end were the best.
/m/lady_of_the_manor	4b19a75c-24c2-30ad-aa7f-bb1356b8a69f	5	Super funny movie with an amazing cast!
/m/lady_of_the_manor	4b19a75c-24c2-30ad-aa7f-bb1356b8a69f	5	Really enjoyed the movie!! Very entertaining story and hilarious jokes throughout. Going to definitely rewatch it and recommend if you haven’t.
/m/zone_414	3f52e028-7d4d-3928-baf4-908a0edd1a11	4	An entertaining movie without being pretentious like others of the same, if you like the cyberpunk genre you must see it.
/m/zone_414	3f52e028-7d4d-3928-baf4-908a0edd1a11	4	Interesting premise - done on a budget but does the best it can with that budget. Unfavourable comparisons will be made between this and Blade Runner, they share some aspects like a Porsche and a Ranger Rover are both cars - but still very different with each serving a different purpose
/m/zone_414	3f52e028-7d4d-3928-baf4-908a0edd1a11	2.5	cant say i understand the hate for this movie.   it was well acted with a strong leading character (especially philosophically). it needed a bit more conflicts and a bit more payoff..   its a bit of a malevolent universe
/m/zone_414	3f52e028-7d4d-3928-baf4-908a0edd1a11	4	a nice mini Blade Runner good surprise
/m/zone_414	3f52e028-7d4d-3928-baf4-908a0edd1a11	4.5	A blade runner feel that wasn't ruined by a committee. It is a fun watch. The bad is from budget restrictions. Some lighting was bad. The story could have used polishing. Overall it is worth watching.
/m/zone_414	3f52e028-7d4d-3928-baf4-908a0edd1a11	3.5	Better than expected. I like Guy Pearce.  Has a Blade Runner feel, and a decent story.
/m/zone_414	3f52e028-7d4d-3928-baf4-908a0edd1a11	1	'Zone 414' is a derivative, unengaging and unoriginal science fiction thriller that struggles to rise above being an abysmal rip off.
/m/zone_414	3f52e028-7d4d-3928-baf4-908a0edd1a11	5	I like this a lot. Indie Blade Runner influenced sci fi. Exploring that theme more of humans vs feeling and sentient androids. Blade Runner is incredible so if done right I see I have no problem with it. Like people playing in that world. Someone could even make own sequel or seperate story under a different name and would be cool. This is really low budget but I like this better than 2049. 2049 had some cool elements but seemed pointless and like sequel made to be made rather than because there was a new important story concept. Like all these sequels to classics. Altered Carbon Season 1 was awesome but this feels more like the feeling of that world to me.
/m/zone_414	3f52e028-7d4d-3928-baf4-908a0edd1a11	4	The idea is fun, and I am a big Blade Runner / Alien franchise lover. Thee camerawork and lighting though is very made for tv, like an episode of Knight Rider from the 1980s. The hints at the mentioned sci fi films are heavily added into this, and that is a lot of fun too. Guy Pierce seems almost wooden, but that's due to the other overly corny actors trying to first year burlesque ham it up. It's bad in that, very hard to watch in some areas. Something about 60fps is weird, too, but just because of how it is put together. One thing I believe that is missing is enough sfx, asmr etc.   Again the camera work and lenses used don't lend them to the high art cinema that Blade Runner was, and the new one is. This looks like a tv show, albeit as mentioned from a few decades ago. It's very creative, and there's a lot of merit to that, makes it easily still enjoyable past the crude production. There's nudity too, female obviously, and it's just, not needed. It should be more, like Heavy Metal Magazine, or not at all there.  Take these strokes in stride though, it's certainly a fun way to get through a rainy night and some snacks in the dark wandering in the dystopia of it all.
/m/zone_414	3f52e028-7d4d-3928-baf4-908a0edd1a11	3.5	Could've been much better, but still better than I expected. This film had some amazing eye candy filler - especially for having a low 5m budget, but the story needed more substance and better pacing.  This is director Andrew Baird first full length feature film, and he did great. For an international (Irish) low budget indie film, it was better than some recent big budget Hollywood blockbusters I've seen lately. The cinematography was outstanding, and even made basic inexpensive sets feel like that post-apocalyptic grungy future one would expect.  The 98 min runtime felt a little long with the slow pacing and progression of the story. The writing by Bryan Edward Hill had some plot and technical issues with some convoluted dialogue, and the screenplay could've used some tweaking by a seasoned writer. Had the film been cut down to about 85 mins with faster pacing, and/or had more grit and suspense with a little more character development, this could've been a cult classic.  The score I found to be excellent, especially for a B grade film. It was fitting, and certainly set the look and feel of the film appropriately. The performances were great by all, especially Fimmel, but I felt Pearce's character could've used more expression and energy.  Overall I did enjoy this better than I expected. I just wish that the story had some tweaking that could've made this great. It's a well deserved 7/10 from me.
/m/the_gateway_2021	6427cda1-dbc2-3855-bb31-9fc6eeef0d97	3.5	I live in St. Louis. My main complaint is that this film is supposed to be set in St. Louis, and while I did not know this going in,  I knew this was not shot in St. Louis, Right away.  It really did not look like St. Louis, at all. The buildings, the streets, the casinos, the police cars, even the sunlight did not look like St. Louis. Beyond that I enjoyed it. Shea Wigham was good, Bruce Dern was great. Olivia Munn was good, as was the girl who played her daughter. Grillo always plays a good pompous ahole. The bad guys were a little suspect. St. Louis does not have much of a Mexican/Cartel criminal element. Overall I did like the movie and SPOILER it does have a downer ending. I feel like these types of movies, small independent movies, are rarely at the theaters anymore, so I was happy to see it on the big screen.
/m/the_gateway_2021	6427cda1-dbc2-3855-bb31-9fc6eeef0d97	3	Good movie with good acting. Storyline a little boring at times and it didn’t even come close to looking like St. Louis where the movie was supposed to be set. We haven’t had electric street cars since 1966 except the new Delmar area train and that train just started running off and on. But it was still entertaining.
/m/the_gateway_2021	6427cda1-dbc2-3855-bb31-9fc6eeef0d97	5	A fun, well acted, well made noir thriller!
/m/the_gateway_2021	6427cda1-dbc2-3855-bb31-9fc6eeef0d97	5	Loved the film. Strong message, great action, keeps you on edge start to finish!
/m/the_gateway_2021	6427cda1-dbc2-3855-bb31-9fc6eeef0d97	2	Ridiculously and annoyingly bad. I really feel sorry for Grillo, Munn and even Dern (who's been horrible in many other bad movies lately, but was actually good in this one) for having their names attached to this far-fetched ridiculous wannabe crime-drama-thriller pretentious mess.  Although Whigham's performance was decent, his character was cringeworthy, laughable, and annoyingly unconvincing. His James Dean wannabe look and demeanor did him zero justice, as did his unrealistic and ridiculous character's attempt to portray a social worker. The casting director needs to get fired for that call, as do the writers.  To make matters worse, there were actually three writers that came together to give us this nonsense; a (pulling out a mini-bottle out of thin-air) alcoholic chain-smoking drug-using gun-wielding emotional-baggage-carrying straight-faced low-monotonic dude-too-cool licensed city social worker? It may have worked as a comedic parody, but in this case, it was as I already mentioned, cringeworthy, laughable, and annoyingly unconvincing. Don't even get me started on the massive plot and technical issues.  The pacing was so slow with many unnecessary and long winded scenes, that the normally time-flies 91 min runtime felt like almost 3 hours. The screenplay was so dull, static and stale, I couldn't wait to get to the end. Aside from the last 10 mins of (somewhat) action, there were zero thrills in this thriller, and the drama was melodramatic in a soap-opera way.  And what was the point of the last 3+ mins of church choir singing? Then right after adding "In the United States, 250,000 children enter the foster care system every year", is an embarrassment to the foster system by portraying Whigham as a "licensed city social worker". What's the point to that message relating to this film? "Hopefully none of those 250,000 children will end up with such an unprofessional and unqualified social worker like Parker" lmao? Adding that statistic doesn't make the film any better, it makes it much worse.  One of those writers, Michele Civetta, also directed this mess. Using fish-eye lens and slow-mo scenes is something I'd expect to see in a 5th grade drama class production - from the 90's. His directing overall was amateurish at best, and he failed in directing his cast properly, with the exception of Grillo, who clearly carried his own weight perfectly without any need for cast direction. The score was ok, but the soundtrack was overbearing. I really can't think of anything redeeming about this film, it was such a disappointment.  It's a shame so much good talent was wasted in this nonsense. I'm giving this a very generous 4/10, more so out of pity for some of my favorite actors having this mess on their resume.
/m/the_gateway_2021	6427cda1-dbc2-3855-bb31-9fc6eeef0d97	5	Gritty drama, Frank Grillo was a complex hero that kept my attention...well done...spot on
/m/baby_money	8f76180d-300f-3a22-95ac-866c807618d2	5	Baby Money is a good suspenseful movie with a great assembly of actors, like Danay Garcia, that portray complex characters. The film has good cinematography and scene selections that blend well with the acting. This movie keeps you involved all through out the film. I highly recommend Baby Money. It is a much watch!
/m/baby_money	8f76180d-300f-3a22-95ac-866c807618d2	5	Such a wild ride of a film I highly suggest everybody check this film out where Ever you can . Damian
/m/baby_money	8f76180d-300f-3a22-95ac-866c807618d2	5	This movie was action packed from the get go. Very creative opening credit scene and then, bam! Off and running. Performances by the entire cast were spot on. Danay Garcia (Minny)was phenomenal in her role as a tough girl on the outside, but portrayed the sweet, caring mother on the inside. This is definitely a must watch!
/m/baby_money	8f76180d-300f-3a22-95ac-866c807618d2	5	It stays in its lane (nothing too flashy) but brings something unique to the tone of the genre. Characters keep you hook for a very quick 93 minutes.
/m/baby_money	8f76180d-300f-3a22-95ac-866c807618d2	5	Great performances and fun ride! It fits into the tradition of home invasion thrillers but it brings humor and style. Love the music too!!! Must see!
/m/baby_money	8f76180d-300f-3a22-95ac-866c807618d2	5	Magnificent movie. Wonderful performances. Powerful thriller. Definitely a must-see!
/m/baby_money	8f76180d-300f-3a22-95ac-866c807618d2	2	Great acting. Well executed indie film. Unfortunately it was very boring.
/m/baby_money	8f76180d-300f-3a22-95ac-866c807618d2	3.5	I was pleasantly surprised.    Given the somewhat tacky original title - I find "dead end" a better fit - and the poor average score on IMDB I was somewhat worried.    But the story was coherent, the characters well-developed, the acting solid, all in all a quite enjoyable film.
/m/baby_money	8f76180d-300f-3a22-95ac-866c807618d2	4.5	Well executed and a solid show of skill from the resourceful filmmakers. Stays within its lane in the genre - nothing too flashy - but its characters that drive the story and the characters work surprisingly well.
/m/baby_money	8f76180d-300f-3a22-95ac-866c807618d2	4	Surprisingly, much better than I expected. This is probably one of the better B-grade films I've seen in a long time. Bonus points that the filmmakers are relatively newbs, especially writer and director Mikhael Bassilli of which this film was his first full length feature film with only one previous short film on his resume.  The directing was great with zero complaints, and he directed his cast effortlessly. The story was nothing revolutionary for its genre, but it was character driven and different enough to keep you glued to the screen. Aside from some minor plot and technical issues, it had constant suspense, and the story progressed with decent continuity and cohesion. The 93 min runtime was just right, as was the pacing. Cinematography was excellent, and the score was perfect and fitting - a rare find in B films, which are normally loud, annoying, overbearing and unfitting.  The casting and performances were spot on and convincing, especially Taja V. Simpson. If you like this genre, this is a decent little gem, especially considering it was put together by newbs. It's a well deserved 7.5 rounded up to an 8/10 from me.
/m/yakuza_princess	4cc6705d-5d3b-3576-8efb-08974eef0822	2.5	Yakuza's plot had potential, even though Rhys Meyer's character was random. But it didn't capitalize on anything - the fighting is meh, the acting is meh, and it's not that fun to watch.
/m/yakuza_princess	4cc6705d-5d3b-3576-8efb-08974eef0822	0.5	Worst movie I have watched in recent time, maybe worst in 2021 for me. Everything is wrong in this movie, the scenario is awful, the actors are bad (only one is good), it's full of cliches and it's so painful to watch. Terrible, really, please don't make a number 2!
/m/yakuza_princess	4cc6705d-5d3b-3576-8efb-08974eef0822	3	Could've so easily been great had any one of the five writers actually created a screenplay that wasn't so choppy, derivative, incoherent, convoluted and riddled with plot and technical issues.  In the 111 min runtime, there was too much walking and talking with hardly any depth to the story or its characters. It had too much filler and very little substance. Many scenes were too long and/or unnecessary. Was this even edited? The scene transitions were horrible. And all that nonsense mystery didn't help the story either.  What this film did have going for it, was decent cinematography, well choreographed fight scenes with awesome gore effects, and excellent performances. Considering this was MASUMI's first full length feature film - as a lead, with only three prior small T. V. roles, she nailed it, wow! I can't wait to see her in more action films, she's a natural. The location and production sets were on point, and the score was fitting and not overbearing as it usually is in many B films.  Had this film been cut down to about 90 mins, with better editing and scene transitions, and more character development instead of all the filler, I may have given it an 8 or 9, but as is, it's only a generous 6/10 from me.
/m/yakuza_princess	4cc6705d-5d3b-3576-8efb-08974eef0822	4	Raizo better watch his back!
/m/yakuza_princess	4cc6705d-5d3b-3576-8efb-08974eef0822	5	Expected this to be a mindless shoot-em-up movie, but really enjoyed the story and the movie. Beautiful cinematography and choreography. Some sections use subtitles, but the movie was fun. The pacing may be slower than the typical Hollywood blockbuster, but it kept building all the way to the finale. A little bit gory, but to be expected based on the source material. Would actually like to see if again.
/m/collection	80c4356d-0e63-34ca-b0ad-9ece0c701f1c	4	I think the writing could have been a bit better because Alex and Mike are great seasoned actors but overall the movie could have been great but was was a really good watch
/m/ted_bundy_american_boogeyman	3331270b-aa38-3d81-95e6-0d94fed52671	1	The liberties that are taken with this film is so offensive it’s pretty disgusting. So many inaccuracies just to show a ‘strong female lead’ which is highly disrespectful to the young women that were murdered. In an age where more and more young women are being assaulted, the least the makes of this could do was base it in fact. Offensive and terrible, just terrible. Also Kimberly Leach was his last victim. Also how can Lin Shaye who is at least 70 be playing the mother of him when she said she had him very young. Just awful and completely inaccurate.
/m/ted_bundy_american_boogeyman	3331270b-aa38-3d81-95e6-0d94fed52671	0.5	The Volkswagen was not a ‘68.
/m/ted_bundy_american_boogeyman	3331270b-aa38-3d81-95e6-0d94fed52671	5	Having watched a few other films on the subject I can confidently say this is the best one. It is stylistically superior in the way it visually paints Bundy as the evil enigma who haunted the minds of young girls in the mid to late 70's. If you're familiar with the story then you'll already know the details of the murders and his confession, etc. This film does not dip into the gutter of a chronological paint by numbers display of each and every murder. It allows the viewer to experience the terror. It's like watching a snapshot of interactions that would ultimately lead up to the tragedies. It's not meant as a retelling of a Wikipedia article - it's meant to bring the viewer into the enigma of the Ted Bundy who lived inside the heads of young girls, mothers, sisters, boyfriends, and society in general during Bundy's string of murders. The film treats him as nearly untouchable - like a specter moving in and out of the lives of victims with an unsettling ease. The victims are fleshed out and not just names pulled from newspapers. The film shifts the focus to survivors of Bundy's reign of terror. The film bears his name yet it keeps him just far enough on the peripheral that he truly appears exactly as he must have in the psyche of any young girl living during that timeframe; a real life boogeyman. For horror fans there is enough here to satiate you including a scene showcasing what goes on inside Bundy's head that is as much an homage to Bill Lustig's "Maniac" as it is a nod to Argento's "Suspiria." The film is like a time capsule directly from 1970's horror cinema. Scenes inside the Chi Omega sorority house the night of Bundy's assaults raise the suspense meter to 100. The film is shot in such an effective way that it's nearly difficult to believe these things really happened and weren't just from the pages of horror fiction. Other films on the subject seem almost pedestrian compared to "Ted Bundy: American Boogeyman" and the problem lies in the missed opportunities to frame the essence of who this man was - not only to society and to his victims but to the woman who raised him, the woman who knew the little boy he once was (portrayed by Lin Shaye). The film is effective because it doesn't just tell the story of a serial killer - it brings you inside the lives of the people he affected - the mothers, the victims, the potential victims, and the team of investigators racing to apprehend him (focusing on agent Kathleen McChesney). This is not the typical movie-of-the-week about a serial killer. Ted Bundy: American Boogeyman is visually effective, the storytelling angle is fresh, and the results are chilling.
/m/ted_bundy_american_boogeyman	3331270b-aa38-3d81-95e6-0d94fed52671	1.5	Yikes. The Bundy story gives aBUNDant material for a great movie. But in this one, you get a cardboard Ted and a really bad made-for-tv feel.
/m/ted_bundy_american_boogeyman	3331270b-aa38-3d81-95e6-0d94fed52671	4.5	I honestly thought this movie was good at highlighting events that took place. It kinda gave me the chills because it really did make me think of Ted Bundy. It is a good movie that will keep you on your toes the whole time. Although I will say there were some parts added that were unnecessary. I would rate this movie about a 7/10.
/m/ted_bundy_american_boogeyman	3331270b-aa38-3d81-95e6-0d94fed52671	1	This is the most inaccurate Ted Bundy movie. It has victims in wrong order including Kimberly Leach killed before Chi Omega. They have Bundy interacting with the sorority before killings including bringing him dinner. They also show him living near by. They have the FBI breaking in during the the murders at the sorority house. Really should have the facts right.
/m/ted_bundy_american_boogeyman	3331270b-aa38-3d81-95e6-0d94fed52671	1	This is one of the dumbest movies I've seen in a long time. The acting is as bad as a 70's porno. It flip flops and is loaded with lies. I'll never get this 90 minutes back.
/m/ted_bundy_american_boogeyman	3331270b-aa38-3d81-95e6-0d94fed52671	4	how well Chad plays Ted Bundy is amazing.
/m/ted_bundy_american_boogeyman	3331270b-aa38-3d81-95e6-0d94fed52671	0.5	My ex actually was the sergeant on death row when Bundy was there.  This movie was ridiculous.  They made up so much it was absolutely ridiculous.
/m/ted_bundy_american_boogeyman	3331270b-aa38-3d81-95e6-0d94fed52671	0.5	We all have heard of Ted Bundy the homosexual mass murderer why does Hollywood need to remake old better movies.
/m/bad_candy	633f81e2-fdbe-37c1-a573-56f87d19ed90	2	Pretty dumb set of short halloween stories 2.0 on because I watched this legit on halloween so the vibes were rhere
/m/bad_candy	633f81e2-fdbe-37c1-a573-56f87d19ed90	3	We get a mixed bag with Bad Candy. I'll give it props for trying. Plus it has Corey Taylor from Slipknot in it. So I'm giving it extra points for that. I recommend it if you like Halloween anthologies. There's a lot of crap out there but this is ok. It does have some good segments. https://foreverfinalgirl.com/bad-candy/
/m/bad_candy	633f81e2-fdbe-37c1-a573-56f87d19ed90	0.5	I went against my best judgement and ignored all the negative reviews and gave this movie a shot, the result? A complete dumpster fire of a "movie" that I couldn't even finish.  I'll start off by saying I'm not picky when it comes to my horror anthologies, at all.  This one just missed the mark in every way Terrible CGI, acting, sets, and mainly the stories I kept waiting for one that would change my mind but as the movie went on they got dumber and dumber. Give ME, a guy with absolutely no filmmaking experience 5k, a camera, and access to a spirit halloween store And I Guarantee I could pump out a better horror anthology than this garbage. It felt like I was watching someones community college filmmaking assignment
/m/bad_candy	633f81e2-fdbe-37c1-a573-56f87d19ed90	2	I like this type of movie, but, this just doesn't work. Decidedly low budget, tonally inconsistent with, mostly, subpar acting.  There's a Gargoyle character that features some excellent creature design, though, and, the Clown mascot that appears throughout the anthology segments is super creepy. Corey Taylor (of Slipknot fame) was also surprisingly good.
/m/bad_candy	633f81e2-fdbe-37c1-a573-56f87d19ed90	0.5	Horrible movie. Production and story line was garbage. They even had to drag politics into a Halloween movie. Pathetic.
/m/bad_candy	633f81e2-fdbe-37c1-a573-56f87d19ed90	5	The effects and overall story combine to make Bad Candy an instant late-night classic that competes with some of the best horror movies of the past few years. Being a smaller indie film, I thought Bad Candy stood up well against Trick R Treat (2007) and Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (2019). In fact, I loved the movie so much I watched it three times already and I plan to add to my personal collection. The bat creature was insane.
/m/karen_2021	4fce8e33-3fa0-4af5-86f1-c405e97c0eb6	0.5	Poorly produced, very predictable and the script was laughable even though it was supposed to be a serious movie. If you want to see a movie that is in the same genre & is actually good, then watch "Lakeview Terrace" with my favorite, Samuel L. Jackson.
/m/karen_2021	4fce8e33-3fa0-4af5-86f1-c405e97c0eb6	0.5	I am conflicted whether I should give 0-stars for this being an objectively bad movie, or give it 5 stars for being 90 minutes of ironic gut-busting laughter (at the movie's expense of course). I decided on the former. There's not much to say that we didn't already know from the trailer. It's tone-deaf, unrelatable to anyone of any race, activist, and of course racist as all Hell. However, even in the tradition of "cringe-watching" bad movies... this bomb falls short in sometimes hilarious, other times uninteresting ways. They can't seem to even get a shot right... with continuity errors all over the place, and just general lack of competence from a cinematography perspective. The score adds nothing to the movie. It's almost as if this movie was thrown together like a dandelion bouquet... knowing the wind would blow it away but not caring. This movie was made for a very particular moment... and that moment it was made for was... "The moment in history that such a movie was possible". 2 weeks before it was released, it'd never been done. 2 weeks later, we all know it should never have been done in the first place.
/m/karen_2021	4fce8e33-3fa0-4af5-86f1-c405e97c0eb6	0.5	This movie was Cringy.  Terrible acting, writing, and editing!!  But I laughed at the ridiculousness, which had me entertained
/m/karen_2021	4fce8e33-3fa0-4af5-86f1-c405e97c0eb6	5	Fantastic movie! The guy playing the rusty trumpet at the end for literally no reason actually put me in tears. So emotional and moving. I also really liked the home decor! I watched this movie and started screaming crying and throwing up from sheer joy, so nice to see evil white women so accurately portrayed. After finishing this movie i immediately ran outside to touch grass just to remember what it was like to live in this awful racist world and started crying again.
/m/karen_2021	4fce8e33-3fa0-4af5-86f1-c405e97c0eb6	5	IT REALL SHOWS WHET IS HAPPENING IN TH TEAL WORLD #blm
/m/karen_2021	4fce8e33-3fa0-4af5-86f1-c405e97c0eb6	0.5	This was a dumb political movie trying to jump on a trend. Bad acting too.
/m/karen_2021	4fce8e33-3fa0-4af5-86f1-c405e97c0eb6	1	I don't think 2021 can produce a worse film. The dialogue was bad, the story was unbelievably unbelievable. "Karen's" wig was awful. So much was predictable. I don't know a person in the world who would have put up with Karen's shenanigans without punching her square in the pie hole. This definitely should have been a made-for-TV movie. I DETESTED this movie. Watching it was akin to torture.
/m/karen_2021	4fce8e33-3fa0-4af5-86f1-c405e97c0eb6	0.5	Woke movie that shows how messed up Hollywood is.   They glorify the bad in America and wonder why everyone hates them.
/m/karen_2021	4fce8e33-3fa0-4af5-86f1-c405e97c0eb6	0.5	This is so stupid I watched the entire thing and its just as terrible as I expected it would be. Heres some advice: Do not buy this or rent this or watch this at all it's complete trash.
/m/karen_2021	4fce8e33-3fa0-4af5-86f1-c405e97c0eb6	1	Lol... well, ok... I saw it. They could've made the villain a bit more believable, but they decided to make us laugh instead.
/m/death_drop_gorgeous	0259d390-27ab-37be-919f-b6b9f5172c7f	4	Pure camp. An amazing ode to great horror movies of the ages, while also making a commentary on the LGBTQ scene and its gate keeping against anyone "too femme." If you go in expecting camp you won't be disappointed. If you try and slice this into pieces…well you might just be next on the list.
/m/death_drop_gorgeous	0259d390-27ab-37be-919f-b6b9f5172c7f	3.5	Written and directed by Christopher Dalpe, Brandon Perras (who also played Tony Two Fingers, as well as doing the cinematography and editing) and Michael J. Ahern (who was Detective O'Hara), Death Drop Gorgeous presents a slasher world that we haven't seen, well, nearly ever in the form: a campy, gay-positive glitter, makeup neon and booze-soaked — not to mention incredibly hilarious — murder saga.  Dwayne (Wayne Gonsalves) has just had a bad breakup, which brings him back home to Rhode Island and a place on the couch in the apartment of his friend Brian (Christopher Dalpe). As he pieces his life back together, he keeps moving somewhat backward, even getting his old bartending gig back, working at The Aut Haus alongside Tragedi (Complete Destruction), Janet Fitness (Matthew Pidge) and, perhaps most importantly, Gloria Hole (Michael McAdam), an aging drag queen who doesn't draw in the young customers.  Unbeknownst to our hero, several club patrons and employees have already been killed and drained of their blood by a social hookup app using serial killer named The Vampire, with owner Tony Two Fingers paying off the cops to stay open. But when Brian goes missing — last seen getting into a cab driven by Linnea Quigley alongside Gloria — Dwayne starts keeping his eyes open.  I've never seen a movie where a man is killed with a meat grinder at a glory hole, directly followed by a scene with someone eating sausages, so this is quite obviously groundbreaking stuff. It's even more amazing when you consider that most of the cast were non-actors and the movie was filmed almost exclusively in Providence on weekends over the course of a year and a half.  The film wouldn't work if it was all comedy, so the slasher/giallo parts all work just as well if not better. That's a testament to the work on screen.  I've always believed that determining that if a movie is a giallo or a slasher means answering a few questions: Do we care more about who the killer is than the killings themselves? Is there good music? And is there plenty of fashion? The answer to all of those questions is yes and I find it happily wonderful that the best two giallo-esque movies of the past decade — and the ones not slavishly bound to the conventions of the genre so much that they become pastiche — would be this film and Knife + Heart, two LGBTQ-positive films in a genre best known for gorgeous and fashionable women being killed in, well, gorgeous and fashionable ways.  That's not to say that this movie is all Bava lighting and dubbed dialogue. It's a movie onto itself, filled with high energy, hilarious dialogue and a creative team whose lack of experience surprised me, because unlike the majority of direct to streaming films that come to us, this feels like the kind of movie that I'd rush to the theater — well, you know, in any other timeline — to see.
/m/another_girl_2021	5a69dfe1-eed3-3f93-ab44-e77ab10d120d	2	2.1 I mean this felt terrible the whole time but I kept watching and it wasn’t tough . Does that make sense
/m/another_girl_2021	5a69dfe1-eed3-3f93-ab44-e77ab10d120d	5	Creative thriller with an ending that pays off.
/m/another_girl_2021	5a69dfe1-eed3-3f93-ab44-e77ab10d120d	4	Surprisingly good for an indie film.  Did not see the first one which might help.  Important message about the dangers of social media.
/m/another_girl_2021	5a69dfe1-eed3-3f93-ab44-e77ab10d120d	5	An examination of what happens when the painful journey inward required of all adults is replaced by a reaching out into the mirage of the Internet.
/m/another_girl_2021	5a69dfe1-eed3-3f93-ab44-e77ab10d120d	0.5	After the phrase "My mother made me take cheerleading, even though that represents everything I hate about America" I was done, I turned it off.
/m/another_girl_2021	5a69dfe1-eed3-3f93-ab44-e77ab10d120d	5	To watch a smart educated woman getting totally immersed in a texting dialogue with an imaginary friend is disturbing and makes you realize it could happen and it is probably happen every day all over the world. Different and interesting. I highly recommend it.
/m/another_girl_2021	5a69dfe1-eed3-3f93-ab44-e77ab10d120d	5	Scary truths for young women...wonderful acting by both Sammi and Peter!

/m/when_im_a_moth	5ea25a0a-7ac9-4ec8-8acd-bc664c0afb11	3.5	"A parable on the ambiguity of political narratives. Possibly an "un-biopic" of Hillary Rodham set in 1969 Alaska. Possibly a collective dream about a young woman with only the most abstract connection to the politician. Possibly both."  How can you not be fascinated after reading that?  In 1969, Hillary Clinton was just Hilary Rodham and she spent the summer after graduating from Wellesley by working her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez, which fired her after a few days of work and then shut down overnight when she complained about the unhealthy workplace. Then, she went to Yale Law School and this past adventure was forgotten as she entered the world of history.  Addison Timlin plays Hilary and the film is careful to never say whether or not she is the future First Lady and Secretary of State. Instead, she's just a young girl just learning to make her way in the world of men, even discovering how her speech works like a short sword against the males that she attempts to connect with.  Zachary Cotler and Magdalena Zyzak, who co-directed with Colter to write the script, also worked together on another challenging film, The Wall of Mexico. Just like that film, this one subverts the story that you expect and pushes you to confront your preconceived notions.  As the moth moves in the stages of its life, from egg to larvae, cocoon to taking flight, the path remains fixed and rigid. No matter what happens between Hilary and her temporary friends Ryohei and Mitsuru, men who live within the wreck of a ship left behind by the last tragedy that struck the town of Valdez, her life seems as if it already has been decided. Is the summer amongst the common people her last gasp at trying to change all that? Or her just realizing that she should know who the little people are before she begins to command them?  No matter how you feel about Hilary Clinton, I recommend that you watch this. There hasn't been a film like it in some time.
/m/the_seer_and_the_unseen	07554c61-3090-3d0f-8eb9-16039341fe2e	5	One of the most delightful, memorable documentaries I've ever seen. In fact, I can't believe this is a documentary.   A truly moving portrait of a wise and charming woman and a thoughtful essay on the meaning of value. A must-see.
/m/the_seer_and_the_unseen	07554c61-3090-3d0f-8eb9-16039341fe2e	5	Loved this brilliant, poetic film. Ragga, the elf whisperer, is a charming and wise woman whose story serves as a window into not just Icelandic's magical landscapes, but into the nature of economic exchange. This was quite a clever film that turns into a meditation of capitalism, actually, though through a delightful character story. Artfully and smartly done. And highly recommended!
/m/the_seer_and_the_unseen	07554c61-3090-3d0f-8eb9-16039341fe2e	3	"A magic realist documentary about invisible elves, financial collapse and the surprising power of belief, told through the story of an Icelandic woman."  Ragnhildur Jónsdóttir is a person who speaks on behalf of nature under the threat of great change. And she speaks to the past as well, a place that — well, we'll leave that up to you, dear viewer — may be still filled with elves and invisible forces that are able to still influence our modern world.  It doesn't matter if you believe it or not. You just need to watch this.  Ragga, as she is called, is a seer who communicates directly with a parallel realm of elves called the huldufólk that at least half of her native Iceland believes in. That means that businesses, individuals and even the government ask her to see where they should build and develop property. However, not everyone believes or listens to Ragga, so when a new highway begins construction across an untouched lava field near Reykjavik — and threatens an elven church within the rocks — Ragga fights to protect the homes of those who only she can see.  Director/producer Sara Dosa said, "When I first learned about Ragga, I not only thought that she was a delightful, strong and wise person who'd make for an inspiring protagonist for a film, but also that her story provided an unexpected conduit to exploring the belief in invisible forces: be they invisible elves or the "invisible hand of the free market," to call upon Adam Smith's original phrase. By juxtaposing these systems of belief, I wanted to make a film about what humans choose to see: the spirits of the land who beckon protection for the environment or the valuations of an economic logic capable of producing gross inequality, environmental destruction and that bankrupted Iceland (among many others). My hope is that the film can show the power of these unseen forces and reveal not just what is worth seeing but what is worth saving."  In her director's statement, Dosa really sets the tone for this film: "We can't see God, for instance, but so many of us believe God exists, and that belief has profound consequences on how many live their lives. The same is true of the forces animating markets, which are regularly taken as fact and the products of "natural laws," rather than understood as comprising a system of beliefs. Rather than state this in sentiment in academic language, our protagonist, Ragga Jónsdóttir, instead is the spirited conduit for this exploration. And, by juxtaposing these systems of belief, my desire ultimately was to make a film about what humans choose to see: the spirits of the land who beckon protection for the environment or determinations of economic value capable of bankrupting a nation. My hope is that the film shows these invisible forces that shape our world and transform our natural landscapes, revealing not only what is worth seeing but what is worth saving."  To Ragga, the invisible hand that guides the world of money seems just as foreign as you or I may see the world of magic. Sosa is uniquely able to tell the story of this juxtaposition, as she graduated from the London School of Economics' joint Master's program in Cultural Anthropology and International Development Economics.   We often see foreign countries as a strange place that we're afraid of exploring. Or we make fun of their unique customs. But perhaps by looking to these places, we can learn something new that can help the parts of the world that we inhabit. That's one of the many reasons why this film is worth more than just a look.
/m/the_green_knight	b9e9bad0-8233-4f4b-8b09-fcf7a61a3b33	4	Dreams happen in seconds this one plays out in hours. Its tantalising and eloquent along with artistic displays of emotion and imagery
/m/the_green_knight	b9e9bad0-8233-4f4b-8b09-fcf7a61a3b33	0.5	So slow-moving movie, so slow. It wants to make you think it has fresh ideas, when it doesn't. Zzzzzz.
/m/the_green_knight	b9e9bad0-8233-4f4b-8b09-fcf7a61a3b33	1	I was looking forward to this film but found the content complete dribble.  Seriously I could of had more fun with the projector turned off.

But beyond that it was full of stunning visuals and excellent acting in a setting that was both familiar and wholly new. I loved this movie.

This is what happens when a Director and Producer try to over think what they are trying to produce. Convoluted mess with no real thought at all. I feel a lot less intelligent after watching this stinker.
/m/the_green_knight	b9e9bad0-8233-4f4b-8b09-fcf7a61a3b33	0.5	A nonsensical vision quest ripe with anachronisms. It is filled with snippets of personal agenda messages that keep it from ever really arriving and obsessively stops to stare at them. It is plodding and very slow, yet still veers wildly between heavy-handed and cryptic, with little internal logic to maintain any narrative. The Green Knight in name only, it  has NOTHING to do with the Legend of the Green Knight; yet again, a film that just rips off the title for false advertising, "deconstructs" the premise, and other than being set roughly in a quasi-historical setting, fails to deliver. Instead it just meanders through its own message instead. The writer and the director should never work again on ANYTHING meant for entertainment, especially if it is an ADAPTATION of ANY existing work.
/m/howling_village	0bd8be9c-e061-339c-bdee-83a4dd23350d	3	Après un premier tiers très réussi, le film chute drastiquement en intensité et se perd dans un récit confus : voyage dans le temps, malédiction  fantôme et même loup garou.

/m/paw_patrol_the_movie	f7078318-72a5-3e88-a757-9d0eda546101	4.5	Great movie. Even as an adult I enjoyed it and it had my 6 yr. old  granddaughter enthralled. She even gasped a few times during some of the scenes.  Paw Patrol was on a roll!
/m/paw_patrol_the_movie	f7078318-72a5-3e88-a757-9d0eda546101	0.5	Why make The Paw Patrol Movie when we could have gotten Sonic the Hedgehog 2?
/m/paw_patrol_the_movie	f7078318-72a5-3e88-a757-9d0eda546101	2	Now before I write this I know what your thinking. Why is this guy reviewing a rated G movie and is about to talk trash on a kids movie? And I'll say you have a good point but I'll keep my complaints short. Anyway I like the idea of the paw patrol. Of course it doesn't make sense that puppies can act that the police and firefighters. How do you even train a dog to do that ? Yes I know again kids movie. But I would prefer to teach my child some logical sense. But I'll let them be to think about a puppy saving people. The best part of the movie 1000 percent is when the main human kid points out that they could afford the huge Avengers tower looking building with all the paw patrol merchandise they sell. He said quote they sell like hot cakes . To me that was hilarious because it's true. Paw patrol is literally everywhere. It's the new spongebob for Nickelodeon. So good for them. In the end this is a forgettable movie with no big morals to learn from but this is more of a distraction for the kids to do for an hour an 20 minutes. I was on my phone 80 percent of the time but at least it was a good distraction. If you have a kid and if they already like the show they'll definitely like this but  if they don't watch the show I don't know, maybe it'll be weird for them to track all the characters but they keep you up to speed on the characters. The animation was good, that's the best thing I could say about the movie. The characters are alright, it's a kids movie so what did I expect, nothing really.
/m/paw_patrol_the_movie	f7078318-72a5-3e88-a757-9d0eda546101	5	My kids and I absolutely enjoyed this movie.
/m/paw_patrol_the_movie	f7078318-72a5-3e88-a757-9d0eda546101	5	Fantastic movie. All my kids (3, 6 and 11) loved it. My son (3) is obsessed with it

/m/pvt_chat	ed00c2c3-2d9a-460c-aa8e-5f610bc48eae	2	Sadly the third act introduces the most interesting part of the story too late, and that was in the trailer, for what should have been the turning point and start of a clever interesting movie. Instead with get a wandering. Julia Fox is great and mesmerizing but sadly the cinematography and directing make it look like a bad student movie shot with 2 bucks and a few friends. The approach was interesting but wasted.
/m/pvt_chat	ed00c2c3-2d9a-460c-aa8e-5f610bc48eae	1.5	This movie is horrible.   It is a pseudo-intellectual, pompous soft core porn.  The only reason to watch this movie is Julia Fox.  Her talents and beauty transcend this vehicle.   If she was not in the film it would be unwatchable; however, the scenes she is in you can not help but be captivated by her presence and delivery.   I think the film was ambitious, but it fails because it does not understand its own identity.   It is porn disguised as art.   It is not art.
/m/pvt_chat	ed00c2c3-2d9a-460c-aa8e-5f610bc48eae	0.5	Honestly, its garbage.. Unless your some kind of art critic that feels the needs to mix words to fluff this up into something special its a waste of your time.
/m/pvt_chat	ed00c2c3-2d9a-460c-aa8e-5f610bc48eae	4	It's understandable that the movie has mixed reviews. The subject matter is offputting, the main character is pretty morally reprehensible & certain scenes are just uncomfortable to watch. That said, there's a lot of good visual storytelling, the performances are all super believable & I found it impressive how good the production quality is considering the small budget. I think its definitely worth a watch.
/m/pvt_chat	ed00c2c3-2d9a-460c-aa8e-5f610bc48eae	2.5	Great to see a movie about the sex industry that isn't just "awwww poor exploited woman." Look this might not be something feminists like but generally in this industry, the women hold the power and benefit from it, and it's usually the men who are exploited. It's refreshing to see a film that actually shows this even if the film overall is quite depressing and bland.
/m/pvt_chat	ed00c2c3-2d9a-460c-aa8e-5f610bc48eae	4	Over the last few years, New York City duo Josh Safdie and younger brother Benny Safdie have created their own niche brand of crime-thriller films. Most notably with 2017's Good Time and 2019's Uncut Gems. Both films are highly celebrated among critics and fans alike with the general consensus that the brotherly duo can expertly craft drama, comedy and crime whilst simultaneously creating of the most anxiety-inducing cinema in recent memory.  In the wake of the immense success of Uncut Gems comes a new film that could fit within the same high-intensity realm, from independent filmmaker and lead guitarist/singer of NYC art punk/post-punk band Bodega, Ben Hozie.  Credited as "A romance about freedom, fantasy, death and friendship", starring Peter Vack, and Safdie Bros. alumni, Julia Fox and Buddy Duress, PVT Chat focuses on an internet gambler living in NYC who becomes fixated on a cam girl he meets online. His obsession reaches boiling point when fantasy materialises in reality and he believe he spots her on the streets of Manhattan.  With its gritty, hand-held documentary-like approach to filming, PVT Chat showcases the mundane and isolated day-to-day life of online gambling addict, Jack (Vack). Sexually frustrated and looking for human interaction; the human touch, Jack frequents online sex chatrooms. During his interactions he meets Scarlet (Fox), a dominatrix claiming to live in San Francisco.  As part of her online work, Scarlet makes Jack her "slave" throughout the course of their online escapades, forcing him to be submissive and humiliate himself for his sexual gratification. Jack will mimic cigarettes being put out onto his tongue, pretend to inhale second-hand smoke puffed by Scarlet through the screen and even spank himself, all at Scarlet's demand. And in due course, Jack puts an actual cigarette out onto his tongue and it's 100% real folks, no special effects or camera trickery. Speaking from personal experience, I've done that once before as a dare and believe me, it ain't fun. Vack has some big cojones to really immerse himself into the character and the mindset of somebody who's a slut for punishment!  Jack quickly becomes infatuated with Scarlet, lying about his position in life to appeal more desirable not just to her but to the world. And in a stroke of luck, he believes he notices her one night whilst walking the streets of Manhattan. To her bemusement, Scarlet challenges Jack to take photo of her alleged doppelgänger. Jack decides to makes a deal with Scarlet, if he can get photographic evidence of her in NYC, she must accompany him on a romantic trip to Paris.  Taking many twists and turns throughout its 76-minute runtime, PVT Chat has the same level of sheer force that its [Safdie] contemporaries wield: the ability to grab a hold of your throat and squeeze until there's no breath left in you.  Peter Vack sets a career-best as "Blackjack Jack". Having recently loss his room-mate and close friend, behind on paying landlord rent but happy to spend hundreds of dollars on sex chatrooms, Jack leads a very bleak and depressing life. Whilst complicit in lying to Scarlet about his "big tech-creating opportunity", he'll cook himself instant noodles in his largely unfurnished, crummy NYC apartment. The desperation and longing for companionship is a deeply sad affair to watch.  Jack's obsessive crusade to prove that Scarlet lives in NYC and not San Francisco brings a Taxi Driver/The King of Comedy quality to PVT Chat. During the scene where he believes he spots Scarlet in the streets of Chinatown and the fanatical stalking begins, everything down to the shaky, (sometimes) first-person camera work is the epitome of that Scorsese, NYC grimy-type thriller.  In equal parts alluring and infuriating, Fox steals the show! Whenever Scarlet is on-screen, your eyes are laser-focused towards her. She's bedazzling. Like Jack, you're desperate to understand more about her and her shtick. Being a cam girl who prefers to keep her personal life more private, viewers are spoon-fed small mouthfuls about her to begin with, causing deep frustration of this elusive and desirable woman. The more the film progresses and her and Jack's relationship begins to blossom, viewers are eventually rewarded with ever so slightly bigger mouthfuls of information on Scarlet's background. However the more you learn, the less you wish to know. Her day-to-day life off-cam is equally as dejected as Jack's. Without giving away any spoilers, one gut-wrenching quote from Scarlet that – to me sums up her quality of life, is, "I make us money so you can do your thing".  In early 2020, Fox spoke with The Hollywood Reporter on being a real-life dominatrix for a six-month stint. "Then I got into the sex industry pretty young, doing S&M stuff". "Officially the job title was 'dominatrix'". "I had heard about another girl who was doing it and there was no sex and no nudity. It was all role-playing". With that level of genuine experience, newcomer and Uncut Gems sensation silences any noise that may have doubted her star potential. She's the real deal in Hozie's film!  Unlike a Scorsese or Safdie Bros. flick, Hozie's film focuses (a lot) less on crime and more on themes or loneliness, isolation, obsession and erotica. At its core, PVT Chat is a film about two people who long for intimacy in two completely different capacities. Jack is a sleazy loner with a compulsion to lie in order to make himself appear more admirable. Scarlet is a confident, predatory sex worker, displaying the darker side to online sex work whilst still being just as desperate as Jack to to link with people on a much deeper level. And its very pure, humane story of love, bonding and loss couldn't be more on the nose than the unprecedented times we're living through with the global COVID-19 pandemic still running wild.  With online sex work becoming increasingly more popular, PVT Chat could serve as both a positive and a negative look on the psychology behind "content creating" as well as the potential dangers for "content creators" and "content consumers" all through a nihilistic lens.
/m/pvt_chat	ed00c2c3-2d9a-460c-aa8e-5f610bc48eae	2.5	PVT Chat is a mumblecore drama that muddles its themes. Julia Fox was absolutely great. Peter Vack was also solid in his role. I liked the film’s low budget filmmaking. It made everything that happened feel more realistic. Sadly, the film just doesn’t add up to much. I felt very passive while watching it. It felt like I’m the film didn’t know best how to convey its themes. After it all ended I just felt empty and that I didn’t get much out of it. The film is also very graphic. That’s not a positive or a negative, just a heads up. Overall, this was a mixed bag. There are plenty of admirable parts but it just didn’t add to much. I can definitely say I can’t wait to see what Julia Fox does next. She’s very talented, and I hope she gets bigger roles in the future.
/m/pvt_chat	ed00c2c3-2d9a-460c-aa8e-5f610bc48eae	5	Really great film. Raw, gritty and textural - the low budget feeling adds to the film's effect and Peter and Julia are spectacular. While the characters live in this distorted online fantasy world, what shines through is the honesty of their desires. Feels like a different type of romantic comedy based in reality rather than standard romcom or indie movie tropes. It feels true, like real life. Some laugh out loud moments as well as heartfelt moments of intimacy. Definite must see!
/m/the_meaning_of_hitler	853c1bdb-8722-40cd-9266-881d349524bd	1	poorly accurate in history
/m/the_meaning_of_hitler	853c1bdb-8722-40cd-9266-881d349524bd	0.5	Ridiculous, stupid and insane like everything today. This should never have been made
/m/the_meaning_of_hitler	853c1bdb-8722-40cd-9266-881d349524bd	1.5	This movie does not say anything new or insightful about Hitler. There's a certain trendiness to the editing and visual style, but that just underscores the absence of purpose. It ends with the trite conclusion that the problem isn't Hitler, it's humanity.
/m/cryptozoo	b34337e6-acd2-41a0-bcd0-0984f875cbf0	1	Ugly to look at, boring to watch and preachy at the niveau of a 13 year old who tells you how evil Monsanto supposedly is:  Cryptozoo makes no use of the potential of it's premise and has nothing intelligent to say.
/m/cryptozoo	b34337e6-acd2-41a0-bcd0-0984f875cbf0	2.5	Rating: C+  "Cryptozoo is undoubtedly one of the most shockingly violent 2D animated movies I've ever seen… and I write this both as a compliment and a disclaimer to sensitive viewers. Dash Shaw delivers what might be one of Sundance's most divisive films both due to its visual content and its narrative/character choices. The voice work from the entire cast deserves praise, namely Lake Bell, but the characters everyone portrays are extremely hard to root for or even agree with their motivations. Despite the ending fixing this major problem, the entire movie revolves around a mission and a purpose that not only I believe it's wrong, but the main character should have also realized her dream was not going to work as soon as she explains it out loud. The hand-drawn animation is slightly confusing at times, but it elevates an overall tricky film to analyze. I'll take the essential messages concerning nature, animals, and even discrimination with me, and I hope everyone else does too."
/m/cryptozoo	b34337e6-acd2-41a0-bcd0-0984f875cbf0	0.5	The synopsis was intriguing and a still shot of colorful animation looked very interesting.  I went to see it at the Tallahassee Film Festival.  The introduction before the title frame was not enjoyable at all.  A guy sitting near me left.  After the intro, it jumped to something entirely different, but at least mentioned the Baku which was the main point of the synopsis.  Okay, it should be getting better.  Nope!  Groups of people started leaving.  I watched a little longer and it seemed to be a vehicle of idealogy more than a good story.  I had enough, and I left, too.  I am sorry that I drove 40 miles in rainy weather for such a disappointing film.  Save your time, there are much better movies out there.  I left out any spoilers, but the opening was just plain awful, and when it changed course after the title frame it just had no appeal to watch more.
/m/cryptozoo	b34337e6-acd2-41a0-bcd0-0984f875cbf0	3.5	The art style will divide the audience, but there is no doubt that Cryptozoo is at times wondrous. At times it's messy but overall it's message and direction works.
/m/cryptozoo	b34337e6-acd2-41a0-bcd0-0984f875cbf0	0.5	While some of the art is beautiful the stylistic choices and clashing styles ultimately make a muddy mess. The plot is so banal it's painful. The characters have less dimensions than a singularity. I wouldn't be surprised if it was written by the third hand account of a stoners dream as delivered by a child and reinterpreted by a sociopath. I can't believe I watched the whole thing, though I'm sure it has something to do with the brain cells I lost while watching it. Truly a piece of trash though very very occasionally charming in a schizophrenic way.
/m/cryptozoo	b34337e6-acd2-41a0-bcd0-0984f875cbf0	3.5	Cryptozoo is a very unique animated film. I absolutely loved the animation style. The creature design also stood out to me. The voice acting was strong all around. The story was mostly interesting. It gets off to a slow start, but then things start to pick up. The film gets better as it goes on, culminating with a fantastic final act. I was also a fan of the themes of the film. They’ve been done before, but never with such a unique animation style. Overall, this was a strange but rewarding watch. It’s not perfect but it’s definitely worthwhile. Not everyone will like this due to how weird it is, but I think everyone should give it a shot to find out.
/m/reminiscence_2021	9f0ff428-97ca-3e07-a336-31c3db5f67b8	1	Not even the talented cast could save this mess. It sounds too familiar of a movie. Although there are some nice visuals, most of the movie is just too boring to watch.
/m/reminiscence_2021	9f0ff428-97ca-3e07-a336-31c3db5f67b8	3	It's like a budget Nolan film.
/m/reminiscence_2021	9f0ff428-97ca-3e07-a336-31c3db5f67b8	3	Reminiscence (2021) is a sci-fi noir thriller and is a directorial feature film debut of Lisa Joy, the co-creator of Westworld alongside her husband Jonathan Nolan. She also directed one of my favourite episodes from Season 2. It is set in a not-so-distant future Miami where the world has been subject to rising sea levels wreaking havoc. Memory tech is a craze where one can relive their cherished moments from the past and Hugh Jackman's character is running a business of it alongside his friend played by Thandiwe Newton. Things go awry when a customer, played by Rebecca Furgeson, goes missing and Hugh's character takes it upon himself to find her. I was curious to check this out and sadly it was disappointing.  - The movie is competently made for the most part i.e the sets, the production design, the CGI, sound effects and music, the pacing, the cinematography, the acting, are all executed well enough that you get the feeling of a proper good looking and sounding movie. It's in the writing and story department where it falters and drags the entire experience down from being a good or even great one to a middling one at best.  - The movie mixes in different ideas and concepts, none of them new, and while on their own they are cool, when blended together with the story you get, it doesn't work nearly as well as there is a lack of energy and urgency that you don't really get throughout. You are experiencing the story play out and it's kinda OK but it never goes beyond that.  - There is superficial depth to the themes and ideas where the movie thinks it is being deep and poignant but you don't really get that feeling. It's just sorta there. Not to mention the fact that the entire plot hinges on a romance that was hardly developed so you don't get that connection which should hook you.  - Take out the competency in other elements and high profile actors and this would be bad but since those things are present, it goes up a few notches, so props to Lisa Joy for that at least and hopefully her next outing will be better. Rebecca Furgeson's beauty alone kinda pushes it one point above for me not gonna lie, it is what it is. Simply put, it was just OK. Disappointed cause it could have been a lot more. Maybe if Jonathan Nolan was helping with the script, that would have been the case, who knows. Not recommended but hey, if you are curious, give it a shot. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 6/10.
/m/reminiscence_2021	9f0ff428-97ca-3e07-a336-31c3db5f67b8	4	Reminiscence has great scenery, the story is intriguing throughout, Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Fergusson shine, but there were other thrillers this year I enjoyed more.
/m/reminiscence_2021	9f0ff428-97ca-3e07-a336-31c3db5f67b8	2.5	Reminiscence almost brought something fresh to the scene, blending climate change distopia and memory recall addiction into one narrative about a mysterious songstress that Jackman becomes obsessed with. The focal point gets lost on the opiate-like quality of the memory recall and we lose the plot and character development.
/m/reminiscence_2021	9f0ff428-97ca-3e07-a336-31c3db5f67b8	5	A trip down memory lane...  A man that succumbed to his emotions, his memories... A memory he held close, but was cut short... And then he seeked for answers... Answers he found... Which gave him closure... And held them dear...  Such a beautiful, powerful movie. Truly one of a kind
/m/reminiscence_2021	9f0ff428-97ca-3e07-a336-31c3db5f67b8	5	While I liked the film, I can comprehend why others didn't. Post-apocalyptic and dystopian are my favorite subjects and what is shown in the movie is a given after few decades. However, there are two independent streams or narratives that never seem to merge. One is a noirish element emphasized more than is needed, and the other is a slowly drowning city with magnificent visuals. However, when the narrator gives the overview of the climatic disaster, you feel like watching a documentary unrelated to the film. The lack of impactful background music not accompanying the compelling scenes of the ocean slowly gulping up the city, submerged houses/buildings, the lights blinking as the town comes to life in the evening incongruously makes you think you are watching a holiday brochure. It is like watching two movies simultaneously, and despite the powerful performances from veterans and a delectable Ferguson, the plot falls flat. Despite the misgivings, I think it would become a cult film as the years go by when the fiction turns into a sad and grim reality for the world's cities by the oceans. I will still give it five stars for the vision that the director exhibits.
/m/reminiscence_2021	9f0ff428-97ca-3e07-a336-31c3db5f67b8	1	While it wasn't terrible, it was really really boring....
/m/reminiscence_2021	9f0ff428-97ca-3e07-a336-31c3db5f67b8	1.5	This is one of those movies you try really hard to watch but realize it would be more interesting watch paint dry.
/m/reminiscence_2021	9f0ff428-97ca-3e07-a336-31c3db5f67b8	1.5	Great premise,  but it failed on what could have been great.
/m/notorious_nick	5dcc2733-9bdb-3a51-acc8-feb85980611f	4	This sports drama was really good. Cody Christian, Elizabeth Rohm, Kevin Pollak, Barry Livingston, and the rest of the cast did a fantastic job in this movie. This true story about a one-armed man named Nick Newell that worked very hard and never gave up on what he loved was inspirational, dramatic, and heartfelt. It's one of the greatest underdog stories ever. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's a must see.
/m/notorious_nick	5dcc2733-9bdb-3a51-acc8-feb85980611f	5	Inspirational!!!  My grandson has a similar arm and it is amazing accomplishment what Nick Newel has done. Broken down barriers. Unstoppable.
/m/notorious_nick	5dcc2733-9bdb-3a51-acc8-feb85980611f	3	Story is ok, storytelling not so.
/m/notorious_nick	5dcc2733-9bdb-3a51-acc8-feb85980611f	5	Loved this movie. Inspirational, exciting, heartfelt and based on a real MMA fighter. Perfect for putting a smile On your face and love in your heart. I really melted at the relationship that this gorgeous guy had with his hard working mom. They only have each other throughout most of Nicks young life and it really is special to see the connection he has with his mom. They take care of each other while supporting each others dreams. They both were willing to sacrifice their dream to make that of the others come true. This was a really feel good refreshing movie much needed during this time of uncertainty and negativity taking place all over the world. I highly recommend everyone take your friends and family to see Notorious Nick, puts a smile on your face and the reminder you are capable of making any dream you have come true. Make a goal for yourself and dont stop until you make that goal!
/m/notorious_nick	5dcc2733-9bdb-3a51-acc8-feb85980611f	5	Notorious Nick will have you on the edge of your seat, cheering and screaming at the top of your lungs! This film delivers on all aspects; it leaves you teary-eyed and motivated to get out of your comfort zone. This is the perfect family film.  Notorious Nick tells the true story of Nick Newell (Cody Christian), who is a one-handed MMA fighter. Nick starts off as a wrestler and faces multiple challenges, but pulls through, becoming a world renowned MMA fighter, known as Notorious Nick. With the support of his family, best friend and coach, Nick proves that sky's the limit.   This film is absolutely amazing. Hopefully the way it approaches disability in an empowering perspective will encourage more studios to do the same. Instead of Nick always being knocked down and seeing the negativity of his disability, he learns his strengths, never giving up, working to find a way to perform at his full capacity. He holds his own against famous mixed martial artists. He also encourages a boy with a similar disability to change his attitude. He believes in himself, even when he is the only one who does.  His mother is a great role model, inspiring other parents by always pushing Nick to succeed. The sheer determination between this mother and son duo empowers everyone. Nick learns how to fight inside the ring and out, even when he has to fight for his right to compete in the Light Weight Championships. He has to prove that - every competition where he has fought was legitimate, and he never backs down - determined to prove himself to the board and his opponent. Stay for the end credits for a chance to meet the real-life Notorious Nick and his coach. He talks about his journey and about how he's only just getting started.  The moral of this film is to never give up; fight for what you believe in; and believe in yourself. Nick always fights against bullies, discrimination, opponents and negativity. With his disability, he learns to compete in the ring, to be considered just as great as his competition. He proves himself worthy to everyone and to himself. Be forewarned that there is profanity and depictions of alcohol use.    I give Notorious Nick 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 15 to 18, plus adults. It is available in theaters August 6, 2021. By Heather S., KIDS FIRST!
/m/notorious_nick	5dcc2733-9bdb-3a51-acc8-feb85980611f	5	AMAZING Stunts, FANTASTIC Acting!! Thrilling. Heartwarming, GREAT Story! Loved it!
/m/swan_song_2021	ae23af9a-c99e-4cbb-b370-ad6f5128796b	3.5	Poignant moving story but too many cliches and stereotypical  characters. The main character says hullo to everyone and they are all so friendly and appreciative of him but the reality is that people would not be so friendly to an overtly camp queen even in 2021. Unfortunately he'd be more likely to cop a barrage of homophobic abuse.
/m/swan_song_2021	ae23af9a-c99e-4cbb-b370-ad6f5128796b	5	Adored this movie.   Feel good and feel sad movie of the year anchored by a fantastic performance from Udi keir
/m/swan_song_2021	ae23af9a-c99e-4cbb-b370-ad6f5128796b	5	I'm usually not into watching LGBT films but this was exceptional. If one were to look past the social issues and look at the inter-intrapersonal relationships it would be well rewarding.
/m/swan_song_2021	ae23af9a-c99e-4cbb-b370-ad6f5128796b	5	This was a terrific movie.  I give it five stars (out of five) for the great performances of Udo Kier and Linda Evans.  Kier's performance was incredibly strong---subtle at times, justifiably over the top at other times, and very funny with his comedic delivery of the script's funny lines.   Linda Evans was also a revelation.  She was a very good actress on Dynasty, but her performance in Swan Song's most dramatic scene brings a depth that I have not seen from Ms. Evans in any previous roles.  Her unseen presence throughout the film helps to carry to movie, as her beauty and grace are in stark contrast to the world that Kier inhabits.   The film is also realistic in its portrayal of AIDS in the 90's, and people's reactions to the disease.  It also accurately portrays the transition of gay culture from the gay bars of the 90's to the online, app-driven world of hook-ups and dating that are so prevalent in today's gay society, and in society in general, as the gay and the straight cultures have practically morphed into one. The film does have some moment where it is slow in its pacing, but the comedic scenes and the goal of the main character drive "Swan Song" to a satisfying, bittersweet conclusion.  Its originality and stellar performances are a welcomed departure from the tried and true, bigger budget movie releases that are so prevalent in Hollywood.  Overall, it is a film worth watching.
/m/swan_song_2021	ae23af9a-c99e-4cbb-b370-ad6f5128796b	3	Good story with good acting and mildly amusing at times. Overall though, I thought it was kind of slow.
/m/swan_song_2021	ae23af9a-c99e-4cbb-b370-ad6f5128796b	5	A delightful, sentimental film about a successful hairdresser whose lover dies of aids, and his friends and community turn against him. When his former best friend dies he is approached in the nursing home and asked to make her over for her open casket, what follows is an emotional journey to the funeral home, escaping his own nursing home to do so, with many turns and twists along the way. A well-acted and delightful film from start to finish
/m/swan_song_2021	ae23af9a-c99e-4cbb-b370-ad6f5128796b	5	Knowing nothing about the movie beforehand, I was blown away by the acting, the storyline, and how I was touched by Swan Song. A magical film. Udo Kier and Jennifer Coolidge give Oscar worthy performances.
/m/swan_song_2021	ae23af9a-c99e-4cbb-b370-ad6f5128796b	5	Beautiful, nostalgic, moving, gorgeous in every respect.  This is a movie to wrap your arms around and love. Udo Kier is nothing short of stunning in his unique and unusual role.  A master-acting-job.  Worthy of an Oscar (both film and best actor)!
/m/swan_song_2021	ae23af9a-c99e-4cbb-b370-ad6f5128796b	4	A funny and touching evocation of aging, in this case the aging of a flamboyant Sandusky, Ohio hairdresser who is lured from a lonely nursing home for one final job. Based on a real person, Udo Kier is marvelous in the role, wearing his thrift store apple green pants suit with Broadway panache. Grief and loss are always present as Kier conjures his beloved David, dead from AIDS these many years. Pitch perfect local scenes and local characters. And Kier wields More brand cigarettes so beautifully I almost want to try one.
/m/swan_song_2021	ae23af9a-c99e-4cbb-b370-ad6f5128796b	5	Todd Stephens did a masterful job of embracing profound loss, celebrating life despite feeling profound loss, creating a loving, complex and fabulous central character and most of all creating a film that enables the viewer to identify with humanity and all of its complexities. Kier's performance is breathtaking; he embodied the joys and sorrows of being human, with an honesty and tenderness that was profound. I am so grateful to all who contributed to this beautiful film.
/m/under_the_volcano_2021	2c9d06d1-7e39-4aa2-9c3c-f74111a77f52	5	AMAZING! Loved it. Highly highly recommended!
/m/under_the_volcano_2021	2c9d06d1-7e39-4aa2-9c3c-f74111a77f52	4	Would like to have seen more scenes of Plymouth but old footage must be hard to find. There was a lovely old pub in wapping with a tree growing through the roof of the dining room where they served huge lobsters. One thing that was not mentioned was the tax advantage in setting up the studio  which I would think was a deciding factor as there are plenty of other beautiful  islands. I lived there 1973 1974 my husband worked for the tax department  there and was partly instrumental in setting up a tax system that encouraged investment in the island as there were ver little employment opportunities for locals .
/m/under_the_volcano_2021	2c9d06d1-7e39-4aa2-9c3c-f74111a77f52	5	Loved this movie. Had no idea so much hit music was produced on the little island of Montserrat.
/m/under_the_volcano_2021	2c9d06d1-7e39-4aa2-9c3c-f74111a77f52	4	Surprisingly affecting. Come for the cavalcade of rock and pop icons and be enchanted by the islanders who contributed to the vibe of the paradise recording studio built by Sir George Martin. Because what else do you do when the Beatles break up?
/m/too_late_2021	4f6632ed-6bd7-47d5-9215-549d0dc3e63f	5	This was outstanding in every respect. The story is fresh, the script is tight and the acting is on point. One of the best of the year.
/m/too_late_2021	4f6632ed-6bd7-47d5-9215-549d0dc3e63f	3.5	Glad to see Alyssa Limperis get her own lead. Hoping even better in her future!
/m/too_late_2021	4f6632ed-6bd7-47d5-9215-549d0dc3e63f	5	Dry humor and more creeps than scares but surprisingly great for a no-budget indie.
/m/too_late_2021	4f6632ed-6bd7-47d5-9215-549d0dc3e63f	1.5	I really wanted to enjoy this movie. I was driven by the rating. I was let down. Acting is bad. Could have been funnier. When I say it’s dumb it isn’t because there is a grown man monster that eats people. But because it was a collection of unfunny follies that didn’t equal an enjoyable movie watching experience. I have doubts about Rotten Tomatoes after this.
/m/too_late_2021	4f6632ed-6bd7-47d5-9215-549d0dc3e63f	5	Witty dialogue, actors have good chemistry and the movie kept my interest all the way through.
/m/too_late_2021	4f6632ed-6bd7-47d5-9215-549d0dc3e63f	5	Enjoyable romp through the LA world of ambitious actors and stand-up comics. The actors had good chemistry, dialog was frequently hilarious and pace was perfect.
/m/too_late_2021	4f6632ed-6bd7-47d5-9215-549d0dc3e63f	5	It was fun to watch all the standup acts. The dialog was fresh, the action held our interest all the way and the cast was great!
/m/too_late_2021	4f6632ed-6bd7-47d5-9215-549d0dc3e63f	5	Funny and quirky - definitely worth a watch :)
/m/too_late_2021	4f6632ed-6bd7-47d5-9215-549d0dc3e63f	1	Not that scary and not that funny. This is one of those movies that’s like, wink wink it’s a metaphor, do you get it? Yes we get it. That’s all we get though.
/m/naked_singularity	c5a50f4d-9d63-4343-a262-e35d61f71d01	3	2.8 . Not the best but quick and watchable . For some reason I thought there was going to be a more sci fi element to this

/m/naked_singularity	c5a50f4d-9d63-4343-a262-e35d61f71d01	3	Could have done without the whole great reset concept. It distracted from the flow of the movie.
/m/naked_singularity	c5a50f4d-9d63-4343-a262-e35d61f71d01	3	Heist for good, haha modern Robinhood with a twist. The whole ride only engage in second gear in the hour mark, too long winding drama upfront.
/m/naked_singularity	c5a50f4d-9d63-4343-a262-e35d61f71d01	5	Great cast. Complicated plot... satisfying

/m/demonic_2021	fd7e0d10-1911-32d1-863e-25f386a50324	1	front to back, this movie is a deep dive into the trite Nd overly exhausted exorcism genre. This movie was...not good....at all. Really wish I had that 1.75 hours back.
/m/demonic_2021	fd7e0d10-1911-32d1-863e-25f386a50324	5	Местами картина выглядит прям вообще пушечно, особенно моменты симуляции, реально смотрится как то свежо прям, но есть конечно сюжетные баги. В целом фильм скорее понравился чем нет, впринципе стараюсь не пропускать фильмы этого режиссёра.
/m/demonic_2021	fd7e0d10-1911-32d1-863e-25f386a50324	1	This is a terrible movie.  It's slower and less engaging than anything in the Paranormal Activity never-ending franchise, which I loathed.  Nobody is releasing anything except excessive boredom and wooden acting.  It isn't scary.  It isn't even creepy.  I wish I had spent my $1.99 on a McDouble instead of renting this movie from Amazon.
/m/demonic_2021	fd7e0d10-1911-32d1-863e-25f386a50324	5	I absolutely loved this movie! What a genius way to portray demonic possession. I've seen every horror movie known to man and I am always looking for something different and this movie is definitely different but in a great way!
/m/demonic_2021	fd7e0d10-1911-32d1-863e-25f386a50324	1.5	Demonic could have been so much more, especially after what District 9 offered. It lacks suspense, scares and the story jumps around. We forgive but we devilishly expected so much more.
/m/demonic_2021	fd7e0d10-1911-32d1-863e-25f386a50324	0.5	Movie had great possibilities but non were taken. Performance of all actors were good... if this movie was directed by a newbie director I could have understand the inexperience behind the camera but it's directed by a guy who made one of my favorite movie called "district 9" & to me its unforgivable... its an absolute disaster..brutally boring, obviously predictable, editing needs to be sharp and atleast 20 mins needs to be cut down...  I hv no clue what the director learned from the movie other than torturing viewers .. I was angry at ridley Scott for removing neill blomkamp from his alien movie but after seeing this movie and very average direction I think it was a wise decision
/m/demonic_2021	fd7e0d10-1911-32d1-863e-25f386a50324	0.5	It's not 'so bad it's good', and that's the problem. It's just a completely boring, flat, genericly bad genre movie. Indistinguishable from a million equally boring other movies, completely generic down to the cheap, flat TV movie cinematography. Really a waste of time.
/m/demonic_2021	fd7e0d10-1911-32d1-863e-25f386a50324	1	'Demonic' is a disappointing science fiction horror film which despite great potential falls flat in every department.
/m/demonic_2021	fd7e0d10-1911-32d1-863e-25f386a50324	2	Although the ideas present in the movie were amazing, the screenplay does not hold up for the most part and the third act was not upto the mark !! Slightly disappointed !!
/m/demonic_2021	fd7e0d10-1911-32d1-863e-25f386a50324	0.5	No, I'm not being hard on it. It's absolutely terrible. Forget that it's full of unfinished ideas- it can't even finish its line to line dialogue or scene to scene transitions without you questioning absolutely implausible ideas. Literally watch any other horror.
/m/no_man_of_god	eaeb00dc-edf1-3df1-ad69-41903a32fd93	3.5	Elijah is a great actor
/m/no_man_of_god	eaeb00dc-edf1-3df1-ad69-41903a32fd93	4.5	This is one of the better Ted Bundy movies. Maybe the best, actually. I felt it was authentic, organic, and  Luke Kirby was easily the most convincing Ted Bundy so far. Having watched Bundy's real life interviews several times, I had to remind myself that I was watching an actor. He presented a splitting image of Bundy, down to his voice inflection and facial expressions.  Elijah Wood won me over yet again, because he made me forget that was even him.   There was something that felt a little too restrained, and at other times during the film, maybe too lighthearted. Overall: DEFINITELY worth watching!!
/m/no_man_of_god	eaeb00dc-edf1-3df1-ad69-41903a32fd93	4	Authentic and disturbing. This was an obviously heavy and bleak film, but also extremely interesting and well-acted by both leads. Definitely worth a watch
/m/no_man_of_god	eaeb00dc-edf1-3df1-ad69-41903a32fd93	4	Wood and Kirby, essentially a 2 man show, worked well together.  Both men were on point the entire movie.  With little to no scene changes or special effects this movie with these 2 actors was able to stand on it's own and captive me throughout.  It isn't a feel good movie its just a good movie.  I must also shout out to the director for sparing us what I thought was going to be the ending.  Movie stopped where it needed.
/m/no_man_of_god	eaeb00dc-edf1-3df1-ad69-41903a32fd93	4	Although the Ted Bundy story has been done several times, the performance given by Elijah Wood and Luke Kirby was genuinely excellent. The movie portrays the darkness of Bundy's soul in quite a frightening fashion. I would never really recommend this movie to anyone. Still, sadly the world we live in is filled with people like the sickened and evil soul that Ted Bundy had become before he was finally put to death, and most of those people are the current leaders of the world.
/m/no_man_of_god	eaeb00dc-edf1-3df1-ad69-41903a32fd93	5	A slowburning but gripping head-to-head which explored the complexity of the interviews between Bundy and his handler. Bundy was ably portrayed as a nuanced killer not quite clever enough to conceal his own scars but still able to justify his actions in his own mind.  Surprisingly watchable and with a genuinely poignant ending.
/m/no_man_of_god	eaeb00dc-edf1-3df1-ad69-41903a32fd93	4	No Man of God is a captivating chamber drama about the relationship that developed between an FBI agent and serial killer Ted Bundy in his final years. This is the type of small-scale, technically inferior, but still engaging drama that is effectively character and dialogue-driven. The conversations are very interesting to follow while the acting from both Elijah Wood and Luke Kirby was surprisingly terrific.
/m/no_man_of_god	eaeb00dc-edf1-3df1-ad69-41903a32fd93	3.5	Ok. Not great, but a good look behind the scenes of what was going on. A little slow at times.
/m/no_man_of_god	eaeb00dc-edf1-3df1-ad69-41903a32fd93	4	It is not really mindhunters but it has its own focus. The mind-blowing mindhunters series was focused on understanding what goes into their minds. But this film was a bit more focused on Ted Bundy himself. And it does fine with it.
/m/no_man_of_god	eaeb00dc-edf1-3df1-ad69-41903a32fd93	5	We've seen all the movie Teds, and Luke Kirby's pre-execution Ted is by far the best. He captures Bundy's look and mannerisms to a T, but his portrayal goes so much deeper than that.  Clearly the actor has a handle on the dark inner workings of the killer's mind, and that's no easy task! A lot has been done on Bundy, but Bill Hagmaier's story needed to be told! His insight into Bundy's psychopathy is unparalleled. Also, for years I've thought about Dobson's bogus interview and how it ate into the time of legitimate investigators looking for answers for grieving families. The interactions with the pompous TV therapist needed to be commemorated accurately on film. Dobson did do good work in the battle against child pornography; he just didn't do any good here. While pornography never did Ted any good, either, it didn't make him into the monster that he was. This film, so well acted, offers much-needed clarity to the character of a serial killer without being lurid. It also has some surprising things to say about faith, what it is, and what it isn't. Kirby deserves an Oscar for this performance!
/m/crime_story_2021	09273e2a-a5a5-3d8f-80da-e6a3950cf028	0.5	So so terrible, disappointing to see Dreyfus like that
/m/crime_story_2021	09273e2a-a5a5-3d8f-80da-e6a3950cf028	2	It was ok.  Both stars were a bit lackluster and not necessarily believable.  Kinda formulaic.
/m/crime_story_2021	09273e2a-a5a5-3d8f-80da-e6a3950cf028	1	Horrible. Anyone involved should retire from the biz.
/m/crime_story_2021	09273e2a-a5a5-3d8f-80da-e6a3950cf028	1	The WORST movie ever... Horrible dialogue, music score is even worse. The acting was atrocious so do not waste your time and money..
/m/crime_story_2021	09273e2a-a5a5-3d8f-80da-e6a3950cf028	3	story ok, production value low, Sorvino and Dreyfuss' performances are oscar worthy ! they save the movie from being a flop to making it watchable
/m/crime_story_2021	09273e2a-a5a5-3d8f-80da-e6a3950cf028	5	Great old-school fun - I don't know what the critics were watching, but they wrong, as usual!
/m/crime_story_2021	09273e2a-a5a5-3d8f-80da-e6a3950cf028	1.5	This was just horribly written and directed. I can't believe what I saw made the final cut-to-market. This film by Adam Lipsius should be a film school example of what NOT to do.  Firstly, this is the perfect example of how a score can make or break a film, and this has to be one of the worst. I'm used to the typical annoyingly loud, overbearing, non-stop and unfitting score in B-grade films, but this was a whole new level of annoying. At the start, I kept yelling at Dreyfuss to "answer the damn door!". But it was the score - a constant knocking sound. Throughout, you'll hear clanging, ringing, banging etc... was there even a composer in this production, or just some random tools in a garage being slammed around?  Then you have Lipsius' incoherent and convoluted story, with dialogue and scenes that will make you shake your head. Why did he shoot the bathroom door where Nan was if he loved and cared about her so much? Don't even get me started on the plot and technical issues, that made what was supposed to be a criminal underworld story, feel inept, unconvincing and boring as it gets. And that's a real shame, when this is supposed to be "based on true events", and you end up scratching your head and yawning by the end.  Next, you have the barely legible muddled dialogue of Dreyfuss, that when combined with his slow and poorly postured demeanor, I thought he was constipated throughout the entire film. Add in Pruitt Taylor Vince's character Tommy, and you have two geriatric actors trying to get through filming. Aside from their snail-paced movements (I'm sure blame falls on Lipsius' failure to direct his cast properly), the entire film's slow pacing, made the normally comfortable 98 min runtime feel endless. Even Mira Sorvino's performance seemed like it was her first ever acting gig (again, due to Lipsius' failure to direct his cast properly).  His (twitchy) camerawork and cinematography were just awful, and this film needed some serious editing. I really can't find anything redeeming about Crime Story. It's a very generous 3/10 from me (much better than the current 0% on Rotten Tomatoes), all going to the Oscar winners out of pity they'll have this mess on their resumes.
/m/behemoth_2021	15e62ddb-cd29-3f62-87e4-632c6a702c2a	3.5	Cool horror movie with lots of thrills & awesome FX!
/m/buckleys_chance	79be1067-1602-4952-8fa4-9d9f2e52d296	4.5	I just love this Australian movie.. well done excellent. I think this movie deserves a five star.
/m/buckleys_chance	79be1067-1602-4952-8fa4-9d9f2e52d296	1	One of the worst movies I have seen all year. Really poor direction, extremely bad acting (except for character Spencer's offsider Jules), corny and predictable story line, and generally very disappointing.  However the scenery was good. Expected a big name like Bill Nighy would be more discerning with his script,and choosing his directors. Don't waste your time and money.
/m/buckleys_chance	79be1067-1602-4952-8fa4-9d9f2e52d296	0.5	Well, that is an hour n half of our life that we will not get back! Terrible Australian? movie with references to ‘hogs', ‘barns', ‘gas'.... Dingos that bark like dogs??? Thank goodness for Kelton Pell, without him it really would have been a dog of a show ~ Save ya money and dont go.
/m/sparkling_the_story_of_champagne	23b28f76-75bc-41eb-99ed-a8d655e45b97	2.5	Sparkling starts off fine, giving a history of champagne and profiling the main producers in the Champagne region of France.  However, 45 minutes in it becomes a marketing piece promoting English sparkling wine!  Literally, the last half of the movie is propaganda for UK winemakers.  Barely a mention of Cava (Spain), Prosecco (Italy), or any other region.  It's so blatant I suspect this film was funded by the winemakers in England.  Watch the first half for a nice historical overview and then bounce.
/m/charming_the_hearts_of_men	c01e0576-5237-3b28-9575-5fe2d617d717	5	This is going to be a sleeper. Great thumbnail sketch of the early 1960's and what women and black people had to endure from the majority of white men in America. It was about the Civil Rights Bill in 1964 giving freedom to all
/m/charming_the_hearts_of_men	c01e0576-5237-3b28-9575-5fe2d617d717	5	Really enjoyed a well written script that cuts to the point of the story of including women in the Civil Rights Act. The actors did a great job!
/m/charming_the_hearts_of_men	c01e0576-5237-3b28-9575-5fe2d617d717	5	Beautifully shot.  Authentic production & solid performances.  A lovely film.
/m/charming_the_hearts_of_men	c01e0576-5237-3b28-9575-5fe2d617d717	5	A great story about how one congressman might have been persuaded by one interesting lady to include women in the equal rights bill.
/m/charming_the_hearts_of_men	c01e0576-5237-3b28-9575-5fe2d617d717	4	You'll like this if your a fan of suspense thrillers and horror movies BUT be warned some scenes are not for the faint of heart
/m/charming_the_hearts_of_men	c01e0576-5237-3b28-9575-5fe2d617d717	5	I enjoyed this movie. The history of civil and women's rights in the 60s.
/m/charming_the_hearts_of_men	c01e0576-5237-3b28-9575-5fe2d617d717	4	Terrific acting, and great story but they glossed over what should have been the climax.
/m/habit_2021	c393af65-c79c-363b-aedd-d78f3de2700d	0.5	awful, bad story, bad characters
/m/habit_2021	c393af65-c79c-363b-aedd-d78f3de2700d	0.5	Aims for fun exploitation, misses by a mile
/m/habit_2021	c393af65-c79c-363b-aedd-d78f3de2700d	1.5	Habit - 2021 (Action, Comedy, Drama) R - 1.5 out of 5 stars  Before I get into the review, this movie has a lot of trigger moments. The film has so many moments that feel like shock moments, just to be shock moments. Constant swearing, blasphemous content, drug use, and more liter this film from start to finish; I knew that going into the movie, though, so if you're going to watch this, do so at your own risk.  I wanted to point out why my reviews vary so much week to week. I pick the film I'm going to review before watching them; as you see, if you follow my social media accounts, I review other films as well, but I decided that I should review the movie I pick regardless of what I end up feeling about it afterward.  Janell Shirtcliff's first directorial effort stars Bella Thorne (The DUFF, Amityville: The Awakening) in a role you won't soon forget. Full of oneliners and many awkward moments, the film strives to be reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino (as advertised by the producers themselves.) I can't say they missed this mark, although Tarantino thrived off of shock and old-school exploitation style filmmaking which is pretty easy to duplicate.   At every turn, this movie tries to shock; it feels like it's a B movie that knows it's a B movie that is trying not to be a B movie. After watching all 29 Amityville films (yes, there are that many), I would put this solidly in the middle in terms of quality. That's not a good thing; some of those films were trainwrecks, to put it nicely. I feel like this film potentially could have a significant cult following. I just am not that target audience.  The film's best part is the eclectic cast; the casting is almost a parody of itself. It feels like every weird character in every strange film all thrown into one. Somehow they make that aspect work; it's a constant back and forth to see what the filmmaker throws at us next. The cast includes Andreja Pejic (The Girl in the Spider's Web,) Gavin Rossdale (singer from the band Bush,) Libby Mintz (Fired Up!, Modern Family,) Paris Jackson (Scream: The TV Series,) Hana Mae Lee (Pitch Perfect) and many others who combine to deliver some odd and drawn out dialogue with varying degrees of success.  I will say that I respect Bella Thorne for being herself; while she may try for the shock factor a lot, she started with many Disney caliber projects and created her personality after stepping away from those roles. Many Disney actresses have become even more successful after the fact (Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, Raven-Symoné, Lindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff, Zendaya, Britney Spears, to name a few) to varying degrees.  As I mentioned at the start of the review, please watch this at your own risk. It isn't for the light of heart at all. In my time seriously watching films, very few have made me question the content. I'm not easily offended by any means, but this one did have me asking; rather, it was a bit much just for the sake of it.  I believe that I'll be reviewing "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings" or the new take on "Cinderella" from Amazon for next week's review.  Where to watch:  Available on most VOD apps starting at $5.99 (Vudu, Amazon, YouTube, and many more.)

/m/habit_2021	c393af65-c79c-363b-aedd-d78f3de2700d	0.5	Um filme ofensivo não só em termos religiosos, que só existe para provocar e nada mais, têm uma história sem sentido e muito mal feito. Horrível!
/m/habit_2021	c393af65-c79c-363b-aedd-d78f3de2700d	0.5	Wow! That was a complete waste of $10 and 78mins of my life I can never get back. I'm stunned by how absolutely hard it was to watch, took me 2 days to finish it. The acting was legit the worst. I wish I could tell you one thing I liked about it…thought that one thing would be that Gavin Rossdale was in it but holy hell that just made it embarrassing and mentally painful to watch him be apart of something so beyond just bad but utterly pointless.
/m/habit_2021	c393af65-c79c-363b-aedd-d78f3de2700d	0.5	A waste of 80 minutes of my life! a failed intent of Tarrantino style that goes down the drained stinking through all the movie... I hope neither the directors, producers or actors will try again pleaasssse JC.
/m/habit_2021	c393af65-c79c-363b-aedd-d78f3de2700d	0.5	Me if I see Jesus: yo what up JC!  Bella Thorne as a theosexual. This has to be one of the dumbest movie of this year. I tried very hard to see this movie as a satire, but it's actually just stupid and nonsensical. Most of the time it's Bella Thorne going around saying "I love you jc" pretending to have a thing for Jesus. Ew like what the hell man. It's like watching those ecosexual communities where people try to have sex with nature. It's so gross and most importantly pretentious.  Since Thorne produced this movie, I guess she thought that she was being clever, but she was just being cringe. Her acting along with the rest of the cast were horrible throughout. The dialogues were unbearable to listen to.   Also, the movie tried to create a surreal and sexual atmosphere with the blurry and pink looks of the movie. There were scenes of characters getting high, which added more to the surrealism. I guess this made sense, but it doesn't cover how dumb the movie was.  Overall, it's cringe and annoying to hear Thorne screaming she wanted to do Jesus. Also, I said "I guess" a lot because I had no idea what I was watching. I'll never get in the habit of watching garbages like this. 0.5/10
/m/habit_2021	c393af65-c79c-363b-aedd-d78f3de2700d	2	Uneven pacing kills it. Characters are dull and violent. Never quirky or funny. Needs major editing.
/m/blood_conscious	732d2e2d-2125-3d09-a4f4-e167753fe089	2	Nice mood and some nice undercurrents, but they're ill defined. Wasn't sure if this was good or not, but the way it ends made me sure these undercurrents had no place to go. The writing turned out to be weak. A lot of promise but little payoff.
/m/blood_conscious	732d2e2d-2125-3d09-a4f4-e167753fe089	1	Poorly written, directed and acted. Little to no budget. Nonsensical choices made by the characters and not scary whatsoever.
/m/blood_conscious	732d2e2d-2125-3d09-a4f4-e167753fe089	0.5	Great actors, but I couldn't finish the movie. It was terrible!
/m/the_last_matinee	b3b1b430-5661-3069-96dd-3d4cfe9086b2	4	It's a slasher flick in the vibe of a classic 80's slasher with a gialo paint job.   In other words, it's everything I love about early horror, minus the exhausting "who dunnit" element of gialo films. Just a beautifully stylistic slasher! MORE PLEASE
/m/the_last_matinee	b3b1b430-5661-3069-96dd-3d4cfe9086b2	5	A total neon horror, giallo gore-fest with kills so stunning and gore so good it physically made us gag. We haven't had a guttural reaction to a horror film like that in quite some time.
/m/queen_of_the_beach	f4835590-f6af-3fdf-9d3e-f538dbec69c8	5	A gritty, honest portrayal of a child laborer's life and her journey to achieve her dreams, Queen of the Beach is a touching documentary film highlighting a global issue in an emotionally-sensitive, thorough, and unique way.  Christopher McDonell is a Canadian filmmaker on a month-long project in India, following some missionaries from his church on their trip. He makes a quick stop at Anjuna Beach in Goa, where he meets nine-year-old Shilpa, a child laborer who is the sole breadwinner in her family. Tenacious and witty, Shilpa instantly forms a bond with McDonell and he returns three times over the next seven years as Shilpa's "brother," visiting her village and learning more about her tribe, the Banjaras', way of life. He makes it his mission to help Shilpa realize her childhood dream of attending school in her small village in Karnataka; over the course of the film, both Shilpa and Chris must overcome several obstacles to reach this goal.  This is one of the most engaging documentaries that I've come across; Shilpa and her friends are vibrant, sweet individuals with layered personalities. Her smile lights up the screen and there's never a dull moment; McDonell's sprightly narration ensures that the pace of the film never drops even when they face some dead-end challenges. Since McDonell poses deep, personal, and tough questions to Shilpa, her friends, and her family, viewers come away from the film feeling like they really know her and her world. Even though the film was shot over the course of seven years, footage taken in 2009 does not feel drastically different from footage taken in 2015; the production quality of this documentary is spectacular throughout the 100 minute duration.  Queen of the Beach is all about making your dreams come true and never giving up even when life throws you a curveball. One thing to watch out for in the film: some mentions of pedophilic activity that occur on the beach at night, and McDonell catches some of this on film. Thematically, this film is for teenage audiences and older as it deals with child labor.   I give Queen of the Beach 5 stars out of 5 and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults. Queen of the Beach premieres August 15 (Indian Independence Day) both on digital and on demand from Under the Milky Way Productions. By Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST!

/m/the_suicide_squad	42f2f1e9-670e-44db-80b9-7aaab25985b1	2	Nowhere near as funny as it thinks it is, which is a statement that can be applied to ALL of Gunn's films, but still a massive improvement over Ayer's abomination
/m/the_suicide_squad	42f2f1e9-670e-44db-80b9-7aaab25985b1	5	focused on what you want to tell, the R rating gives you the freedom to create a fun, gory, and heartfelt story.
/m/the_suicide_squad	42f2f1e9-670e-44db-80b9-7aaab25985b1	3.5	Small moments sometimes carry a movie. This movie had many small moments that I latched onto. I loved most of the Rat Catcher parts and all of the story of Polka Dot Man. Parts of King Shark really hit. James Gunn really knows how to get you invested in characters. I recommend this movie to those who know the genre and like DC.
/m/the_suicide_squad	42f2f1e9-670e-44db-80b9-7aaab25985b1	4	The opening 15ish minutes of this film should get a best picture nom
/m/the_suicide_squad	42f2f1e9-670e-44db-80b9-7aaab25985b1	4	Fun & Action & Gore. Just my cup of tea. Didn't expect to love certain characters as much as I did. Some scenes are a bit cringe but overall the movie delivered on his promise.
/m/the_suicide_squad	42f2f1e9-670e-44db-80b9-7aaab25985b1	5	I want to start by saying this is my favorite movie of all time so some people probably won't agree with me, which is totally fine. I will start with the pros, 1. It's the best d.c movie imo, and in the following reasons I will explain why it is my favourite. 2. It is a gory bloodbath superhero movie. 3. It has some pretty funny and humorous scenes. 4. Not only is it a superhero/supervillain movie it has the dumbest of supervillains and anti heroes, dumbest doesn't mean bad, Infact i loved every character. 5. It has a fantastic cast, Idris Elba, Margot Robbie, John Cena, Pete Davidson,etc. Personally I don't really think there was a bad thing, I had some very minor nitpicks. But honestly I love this movie.
/m/the_suicide_squad	42f2f1e9-670e-44db-80b9-7aaab25985b1	4	Much improved on the first outing I just wish it was named different as it was confusing enough for a comic book fan.im guessing it was totally lost on the general public!
/m/the_suicide_squad	42f2f1e9-670e-44db-80b9-7aaab25985b1	2	There were a lot of elements that seemed to be done for the sake of being spontaneous and humorous, and most of it didn't work. I get that the movie leans on the gory and ruthless side, but most of it was unnecessary to the storytelling of the movie. It was all over the place. Not to mention, a lot of unnecessary character deaths too. Although, I must say, the aesthetic of the film was absolutely stunning.
/m/the_suicide_squad	42f2f1e9-670e-44db-80b9-7aaab25985b1	4	Oh. Well that was a huge, an extremely huge and maximum madness. Incredible ride from the beginning until the end, when you practically have no idea what to expect as the moviemakers are able to kill all the characters in first five minutes and then just replace them by new ones. And yes, I probably should have checked the PG rating, because unlike other superhero movies there's everything pictured, body parts are flying around all the time, one massacre follows another and no, I didn't quite expect that :'D Actually I don't even know what exactly I expected, because whatever you start to think and theorize, it changes completely in few minutes. As I said, it's a total madness, but it works just perfectly.
/m/the_suicide_squad	42f2f1e9-670e-44db-80b9-7aaab25985b1	5	James Gunn es un genio. Sangre, mucho humor negro, referencias, personajes con carisma y un buen soundtrack. Esto es mejor que la película del 2016. A ver como nos trae la tercera película. Con mucho amor.
/m/you_will_die_at_twenty	856b9d55-2a15-3535-beac-e71f8fd37a9b	5	The movie is very well made and shows a side of Sudan and the location of the village of Al-Gezira is rarely seen by outsiders. It portrays the culture and way of life in the remote and isolated Sudanese villages.  Beautifully captured panoramic scenes and an intriguing storyline that evokes mixed reactions depending on your beliefs, religious or otherwise.
/m/rising_wolf	7d4d9b3b-bd22-4031-8c9b-23492a443d1b	5	As far as limited location films got his is one of the best of them. It's unique. It's the first sci-fi I'm aware of like it. Slow at the start but kicks of and gets more interesting. This is an Aussie sci-fi so expect it to be a little weirder than American sci-fi - enjoyed it and a surprise if anything
/m/rising_wolf	7d4d9b3b-bd22-4031-8c9b-23492a443d1b	0.5	The whole movie could have been done in 5 min. Absolutely no plot and the ending is as open as a barn door. Not worth watching.
/m/whirlybird	737f322f-3715-42b8-a6e4-d64cbb1d934f	4	Very thorough, easy to follow and interesting story about a man pursuing breaking news stories to the exclusion of everything else.  And what happened to his family life and his life as a result.  A bit long and well worth watching.  As an aside, if you saw the O J Simpson footage, this movie is about the man that was on his trail first and provided camera footage of the event.
/m/whirlybird	737f322f-3715-42b8-a6e4-d64cbb1d934f	5	Excellent relationship film with the backdrop of the major news stories in Los Angeles as told from a live helicopter by a husband & wife team. A must see!
/m/for_madmen_only	b8b0fff3-073e-4138-8083-239fa17188db	5	An absolutely hilarious ride.
/m/pig_2021	602b5245-75da-4d19-bc21-0d4632e3c32b	2.5	I don't get it. I'm gonna go to film school then revisit cause something must have gone over my head
/m/pig_2021	602b5245-75da-4d19-bc21-0d4632e3c32b	4.5	The film writing is brilliant. it's certainly broody but Nicholas Cage shines in this role. He does a terrific job in  drawing in the audience in to feel for his pain, to care for his plight.  The chemistry with Alex Wolff (Amir) feels believable and real. The story goes a direction I didnt' expect and found that inspiring. well done to co-writer director Michael Sarnoski & co writer,Vanessa Block.
/m/pig_2021	602b5245-75da-4d19-bc21-0d4632e3c32b	5	Nicolas Cage quests for his truffle pig and finds catharsis.  Director Michael Sarnoski's indie drama Pig (2021) is poignant with its human empathy and features an adorable pig! Sarnoski's direction is a slow burn, but you will likely cry or at least feel genuine sympathy for these hard worn characters. Sarnoski's style lulls you into a sense of the familiar, but Pig is not a revenge thriller, it's a straight drama about a man seeking solace after his wife died and he became a hermit in the woods. Isolation is lonely, but that pig made him feel alive and loved.  Nicolas Cage is resonant as the hermit hero and former gourmet chef Robin Feld. Cage says so much with a few hurt expressions and gentle words. His several speeches about humanity, taste, cuisine, fatherhood, and love are profoundly affecting. Pig is honestly Cage's greatest dramatic acting and his best acting since Moonstruck and The Cotton Club. I'm glad he took Pig seriously and never overacts in that uniquely impressionistic way he often does. Cage is very talented and demonstrates how he can be subtle and sincere in every moment of Pig. You are constantly waiting for him to explode in anger or seek vengeance, but he merely exists and forgives. Life is too short to waste on wallowing in pain for Robin. I loved Pig primarily because of Cage's earnest and nuanced lead acting.  Alex Wolff actually steals the show for me as the hilarious hipster truffle merchant Amin with his love of classical music as a display of superiority. I loved how Wolff portrays this unloved kid making his own business, trying to pretend to be tough and chic, trying to make a friend, reconnecting with his father, and finding a way to let go of his mother. Wolff accomplishes so much within his funny lines and heartfelt stares as he understands this lost chef more than he could have ever known.  Adam Arkin is excellent as the cruel, distant father to Amin with an emotional center. Gretchen Corbett is likable as the stern truffle hunting boss Mac with her immediately likable frankness and fair concern for Robin's truffle pig. David Knell is fantastic as the astonished Portland chef Finway with his broken dreams of an English pub in his city as you see this pain of a lost dream in his eyes. October Moore is quite moving in her brief cameo as Helen the baker as she reconnects with Robin. Nina Belforte is good as Charlotte too. I just loved the cute little pig, even if it's only in the film for a few short scenes.  Vanessa Block and Michael Sarnoski's writing is quite poignant, leaving you satisfying, destroyed, and renewed much like Cage's character at the end of Pig. The pig is really just a metaphor for his dead wife's companionship as you realize by the end each character just had to find a way to say goodbye on their own terms. Pig is about farewells, maturity, cuisine, friendship, perseverance, and closure. I love all the short monologues about lost loved ones, a finely cooked meal, or one's aspirations in life. Pig's script is lovingly crafted.  Editor Brett W. Bachman keeps the story moving with sharp cuts in time to skip unnecessary travel and get us right to the next conversation. His style may be too graceful and gentle for some looking for a faster pacing, but I was enthralled by every minute of Pig. It keeps you thinking and feeling for 91 brief minutes. Patrick Scola's cinematography is lovely with lush forest backdrops in gorgeous wide shots, to the stark and depressing Portland cityscape. I love all the tender close-ups that hold on people while they grieve.  Tyler B. Robinson's production design brings modern Portland to life in all its vegan restaurants and hipster indie culture. You feel how insufferable and desolate this supposedly thriving metropolis wants to be known for, but isn't quite. Gwen Hopman-Damon and Katherine Isom's set decoration is all warmth and natural furnishings for a relatable homespace. Mike Ugoccioni's visuals look real and that's high praise for any CGI artist. Composers Alexis Grapsas and Philip Klein write gentle melodies and serene musical passages for Pig. I love the classical music throughout the background too as well as the final folk song.  Raymond Park, Demetri Evdoxiadis, and Amanda Zohar's sound design is beautiful and minimalist for Pig. From ambient forest noises to the pig's snorting and oinks, Pig places natural sounds above all else with a realistic atmosphere. The cooking scenes are so tranquil like walking through a calm forest. Jayme Hansen's costumes look cool from Cage's rags to Wolff's slick hipster garb. Nicolas Cage looks terrible in all his aging, rustic, bruised, and bloodied appearance from make-up artists Pamela Warden, Claire Brooksbank, and Amber Arpin.  In all, Pig is a sweet and touching film that really surprised me with its authentic taste.
/m/pig_2021	602b5245-75da-4d19-bc21-0d4632e3c32b	2	I was concerned about the lead in the movie, because I don't find Cage sympathetic.  As it turns out he's not suppose to be.  Consequently I didn't care much for his story or the pretensious/artsy telling of it.   It was boring.
/m/pig_2021	602b5245-75da-4d19-bc21-0d4632e3c32b	4	A quirky story well told. A homage to experience, if not wisdom, and to food.   A good turn by Nicholas Cage, he of some hits and many misses.
/m/pig_2021	602b5245-75da-4d19-bc21-0d4632e3c32b	0.5	Slow, meaningless. At one point in the movie Rob need to find a name/person and goes to an underground "fight club". It just felt totally disconnected from story. No, like all Cage movies. Flip or flop. This was a flop.
/m/pig_2021	602b5245-75da-4d19-bc21-0d4632e3c32b	4	amazing film and one of the best Nicholas Cage movies I've seen in years
/m/pig_2021	602b5245-75da-4d19-bc21-0d4632e3c32b	3.5	Pig is a fascinating, interesting film that I feel doesn't quite follow through on its promising start. Robin lives in a cabin deep in the Oregon forests with his beloved pig. The pig is an expert truffle forager and gives Robin a living as Amir comes from Portland to buy his truffles. One night though Robin is assaulted and his prize pig is abducted. Robin is naturally distraught as the pig is not just a source of income but a friend and companion. He sets off to Portland to try and track his pig down, which leads to a variety of events that give us an indication of Robin's past and why he now leads the solitary life that he does. I have never been a great Nicolas Cage fan but he does a good job here as the pained and hurt Robin. There's plenty to digest in this film and it is always interesting but I felt it ran out of steam before the end.
/m/pig_2021	602b5245-75da-4d19-bc21-0d4632e3c32b	3.5	Deep meaning and feeling. A bit melodramatic though and certainly has it's slow moments.
/m/pig_2021	602b5245-75da-4d19-bc21-0d4632e3c32b	0.5	no justice, no closure, just a slowly paced movie about sadness, stupidity, and greed.  I understand what the movie wants to say, but i'd never watch it again.
/m/enemies_of_the_state	b4bb020f-68fc-417e-b25e-39fcbdbe72ef	5	People can have many perspectives until the problem becomes their own. From that point on reactions take identical approaches. So we can't judge the entrapped.  Who is strong enough to stand against the colossus of states. Should we question? Is keeping secrets truly the loyalty? Isn't revelations of truth a way to express true strength and greatness of a nation?  This is not a regular one-sided documentary but rather a spectacle of colliding theories and information chess game between govt and DeHart family.  Justice is a inevitable either by law or nature.
/m/lorelei	7ed31993-5670-46a9-867e-a95d99bdec2b	4	Jena Malone and Pablo Schreiber play some of the most believable characters I've seen in a while. It's a gritty family drama with a strong currently of restoration and rebuilding....but in a way that avoids cheese or schmaltz.
/m/lorelei	7ed31993-5670-46a9-867e-a95d99bdec2b	3.5	Exceptionally strong performances from Pablo Schreiber and Jena Malone highlight this family drama that treads over familiar and at times predictable territory.  Despite these flaws it manages to offer enough warmth and poignant  moments to lift it's set up.  Schreiber plays a man who emerges from prison after 15 years.  He settles back in with his former girlfriend, Lola (Jena Malone) who now has three children.  His attempts to adjust into a Dad-like role leads him to withdraw.  But when Lola herself takes off he is forced to make that giant step without even knowing how.  Worth watching for it's incredible real acting alone.
/m/lorelei	7ed31993-5670-46a9-867e-a95d99bdec2b	3.5	Thanks to five great performances Lorelei connected.  Pablo Schreiber plays a recently released convict who reconnects with his High School sweetheart, played by  Jena Malone.  While the slow burn family melodrama isn't for everyone, it's so rare we have three kids that can act and have this much depth.  Amelia Borgerding, Parker Pascoe-Sheppard, and Chancellor Perry each are important to the film.  It's wonderfully shot by writer and director Sabrina Doyle who gets blue collar life.  Schreiber and Malone are must watch characters.  If you like movies it's hard not to enjoy the lived in feeling of this picture.  When the focus is on the family, 'Lorelei' thrives.  It's not perfect, but it brought tears and joy and that's pretty great!  Final Score: 7.2/10
/m/lorelei	7ed31993-5670-46a9-867e-a95d99bdec2b	5	I think "Lorelei" shared a fresh perspective on how you can always get a second chance at life no matter what. Very hopeful story.
/m/lorelei	7ed31993-5670-46a9-867e-a95d99bdec2b	5	This movie proves that you don't need a big budget to make a good movie if you have a good screenplay and good actors.  This film gives you lots to think about in terms  of the themes of family, second chances and redemption.  Definitely not a formulaic story, plus the three kids are all amazing.
/m/lorelei	7ed31993-5670-46a9-867e-a95d99bdec2b	3.5	Nu are nimic super dar Pablo si Jena is bine
/m/lorelei	7ed31993-5670-46a9-867e-a95d99bdec2b	2.5	The scenes involving the kids are incredible. All other scenes are mediocre at best. A ton of potential, sadly unrealized.
/m/lorelei	7ed31993-5670-46a9-867e-a95d99bdec2b	3.5	The acting was superb making the characters believable. The pacing - a little slow, but held my interest until the last third of the film. The ending seemed quick and contrived. I understood the choices but again, seemed as a quick wrap up. I didn't like the way they came about. Overall - nice to watch a real film again.
/m/lorelei	7ed31993-5670-46a9-867e-a95d99bdec2b	4	Realistic — so true for many people in our rural communities
/m/sweat_2020	fe1f32d2-b5bd-4e63-ae38-5fcf769de2c1	4	Sweat works with the art of empathy, the one with which director Magnus Von Horn and star Magdalena Kolesnik work and the empathy they get the viewer to feel about the central character, a woman who sees herself deshumanized by the public she works for, a public that donesn't allow her to feel lonely or to experiene human sensations.
/m/sweat_2020	fe1f32d2-b5bd-4e63-ae38-5fcf769de2c1	5	This movie is like Black Mirror but without the killing Ipads.
/m/sweat_2020	fe1f32d2-b5bd-4e63-ae38-5fcf769de2c1	4	Very good performance. The movie brings thoughts about the modern aspect of celebrities.
/m/sweat_2020	fe1f32d2-b5bd-4e63-ae38-5fcf769de2c1	3.5	Moving and intriguing to see how von Horn orchestrates a major life theme today - the painful unconscious fears about lovability seeping out beyond superficially glamorous personas and lifestyle patterns of living out your life online, as the lead female character does. The plasma TV is indeed far too big for the room in which people gather - is part of our humanity dominated and flattened by screen-based, online living? The scenario with the bleeding, beaten up guy being sick all over the hospital reception window and floor seems to represent invisible forces stemming from wounds that are ultimately impossible to suppress. Blood and sick on the sequinned dress tarnishing the glittering appearance of pleasure. The tv interviewers' and sponsors' reactions of ikkiness and wish to disassociate symbolise a wider unease with being emotionally honest - which means a messy departure from the narrow script of achievement no-one can ultimately live up to - about psychological difficulties of living in today's surface-obsessed world...Close human connection involves risk and trauma, but, as the woman's action in helping the guy get treatment shows, is a reality deal we cannot afford to massively compromise on in the name of fame and success if we are going to stay fully human and compassionate about each other. Look forward to seeing how von Horn's oeuvre evolves further..
/m/john_and_the_hole	92194f23-d7eb-43f2-984c-ac4678864a84	3	Rating: B-  "John and the Hole is yet another ambiguous entry in this year's edition of Sundance, but this time, it actually comes close to satisfy me. Ignoring a particular storyline that I don't fully understand yet (second viewing required), Pascual Sisto's direction and Nicolás Giacobone's screenplay leave too many pending questions to my taste, but I can't deny some of them generate quite an interesting debate within myself. Either I'm just scratching the surface of something greater, or the underwhelming, uneventful, basic developments of intriguing situations are nothing more than exactly that. The phenomenal performances from everyone involved (and I genuinely mean everyone), the exquisite camera work, and the addictive score all add to the incredibly suspenseful atmosphere that kept me invested until the very last second. Still, that ending… I don't know."
/m/john_and_the_hole	92194f23-d7eb-43f2-984c-ac4678864a84	1.5	This was a huge let down.
/m/john_and_the_hole	92194f23-d7eb-43f2-984c-ac4678864a84	2.5	While the premise and tone of this movie sets your expectations high, it ultimately doesn't go anywhere. This movie is the rendition of a treatment without any plot or structure. There are loose ends everywhere and ultimately no consequences.
/m/john_and_the_hole	92194f23-d7eb-43f2-984c-ac4678864a84	5	This movie is getting so much hate! Must be doing something right! I think all the haters are the ones that end up in the hole, unaware of their inner selves...
/m/john_and_the_hole	92194f23-d7eb-43f2-984c-ac4678864a84	1	Made an account to say how much I hated this movie.
/m/john_and_the_hole	92194f23-d7eb-43f2-984c-ac4678864a84	4.5	I'm still thinking about it which in my book is always a sign of a good movie.
/m/john_and_the_hole	92194f23-d7eb-43f2-984c-ac4678864a84	1	Let down of an ending. Kept watching this to make sure the family had him committed.... Don't waste your relaxing Sunday on this.
/m/john_and_the_hole	92194f23-d7eb-43f2-984c-ac4678864a84	1	John and the Hole is a holy mess of intriuging premise taking every onfocused turn possible to make it a insufferable waste of time.
/m/john_and_the_hole	92194f23-d7eb-43f2-984c-ac4678864a84	3.5	Minimalistic but terrifying at the same time.
/m/john_and_the_hole	92194f23-d7eb-43f2-984c-ac4678864a84	2.5	John and the Hole is an incredibly strange watch. The film has a very intriguing setup. I liked all of the actors, and I really liked how this was filmed. The film is rarely boring, and makes you ask questions as you watch. But the film’s ambiguity is both a blessing and a curse. It keeps you thinking throughout the film. But the film is also so ambiguous that you struggle to come up with any answers. Nothing really gets resolved, and then the film just… ends. It’s very underwhelming. Overall, this was very polarizing. A lot of stuff was interesting, but it just didn’t come together as well as I wanted it to. If the film was slightly less ambiguous I might’ve given this a more positive review, but unfortunately the film just left me divided.
/m/never_gonna_snow_again	e3c12c72-887e-484d-87b4-60d57f9b2914	3.5	Interesting film, I enjoyed it more than most other virtual movies the past year.

/m/never_gonna_snow_again	e3c12c72-887e-484d-87b4-60d57f9b2914	4	A true story of a superhero who delves into improving the lives of environments. An almost surrealism that must be considered as a true masterpiece
/m/never_gonna_snow_again	e3c12c72-887e-484d-87b4-60d57f9b2914	2	This movie should have been much better than it was.  The theme of a masseur witnessing lives in a wealthy neighborhood is very promising,  and these scenes were very well done.  However,  the movie then seemed unwilling to pursue it seriously, instead opting for sentimentality and a silly magical realism that was incoherent even by the standards of that genre.  In the end, it was childish and unserious.
/m/never_gonna_snow_again	e3c12c72-887e-484d-87b4-60d57f9b2914	3	When an enigmatic massage therapist/hypnotist from the Chernobyl area of Ukraine shows up in an upscale Polish gated community, he miraculously attends to the healing of an assortment of residents with varying physical and emotional needs. But who is he really, especially in light of his special powers that make him seem like a subdued but otherworldly superhero? That's the gist of this atmospheric tale from directors Malgorzata Szumowska and Michal Englert, which seamlessly weaves drama, science fiction and delightful humor in a modestly intriguing story, thanks in large part to the fine lead performance of Alec Utgoff. However, despite an engaging premise, captivating back story and colorful supporting characters, the film's deliberate ambiguity gets stretched quite thin after a while, leaving viewers wonder exactly where this film is going, with a concluding payoff that's somewhat less than satisfying. As a vehicle that seems quite self-satisfied with itself for its beautifully filmed but nevertheless cryptic nature, the filmmakers have left the audience somewhat in the dark with some of their meandering, underdeveloped and unexplained narrative choices. The result is a film that probably should have gone through an additional round of script changes and final edits before being released, alterations that would have made for a much more satisfying picture.
/m/mandibles	ab28f264-62c7-44c1-894a-f79c715492a4	0.5	I've seen horrible, terrible movies like carnosaur, the blob, critters, that one horrible movie about a Mormon guy refusing to bang a cutie Polynesian girl, and some other terrible piles of sh*t, but this one is in the realm of terrible beyond salvation and also somehow praised by some pretentious douchebags who claimed "oh it's so experimental", blegh, what a waste of an hour and some minutes if I could go back in time I would punch myself for exposing myself to this hot garbage.

Made me physically cringe like I was watching highschool play out again... But it also was kinda choppy and had some very weird scenes and story choices. I liked the spots where there was some lessons being learned but that only took up a small portion of the movie. Most of the movie was your typical fish out of water humor and some weird  interactions among the characters. Just an odd ball movie that I couldn't get into totally.

/m/the_exchange_2021	7c686e87-0e8d-3f04-b4a0-0aa75da79f09	5	I thought it was a heart warming little film! Loved Brenda and Stephane! Cute moments and some good laughs.
/m/the_exchange_2021	7c686e87-0e8d-3f04-b4a0-0aa75da79f09	5	A great summer flick.
/m/how_it_ends_2021	3b957c52-890e-4562-81d5-edb192b0762f	1	What a vapid, typical format movie.  A couple obligatory car chases, a shoot out or two and I thought I'd be spared the sex scene, but nope popped that crucial tidbit in at the end.  This thing doesn't even qualify as an apocalypse movie.  Poorly researched, loads of loose ends and it never does enlighten the audience its held hostage for almost two hours what really even happened.  Frustrating.  Don't even waste your time on this dud.
/m/how_it_ends_2021	3b957c52-890e-4562-81d5-edb192b0762f	3	Rating: B-  "How It Ends is an inoffensive, light, entertaining character-study that ultimately accomplishes its goal of being a fun introspection on the protagonist's life. With the use of a generic plot device, Daryl Wein and Zoe Lister-Jones create a simple yet repetitive narrative featuring dozens of famous cameos in a non-stop sequence of walking in the middle of an empty street until a new character shows up to offer yet another funny moment. Nevertheless, it contains more heart and soul than what's at the surface. Lister-Jones and Cailee Spaeny carry and elevate the entire movie on their shoulders, delivering two impressive performances that I just couldn't take my eyes off. Despite the obvious tendency to be just an amusing, innocent film, the main character is someone everyone can relate to, which definitely makes the movie much more compelling. Doing something that people regret later is an inevitability of life, but making amends with it shouldn't be left to an extreme chance or to the very last moment when everything is about to end… and this is a message I can get behind."
/m/how_it_ends_2021	3b957c52-890e-4562-81d5-edb192b0762f	0.5	I made it to 22 minutes. The end of the world is just a background excuse for extremely annoying people to walk around the hollywood hills musing on their uninteresting and unrelatable "problems". Don't know how it made it to the % it did, it has no redeeming features
/m/how_it_ends_2021	3b957c52-890e-4562-81d5-edb192b0762f	3.5	This was a surprisingly good little small comedy. Zoe Lister-Jones was good as usual, and the cast of weird characters encounters were all great!  If you enjoy little comedies with dry verbal humor, give it a shot! Some may find it boring but I definitely did not.  Well now that I actually made an RT account because Out of Death was just so terrible, I guess I start reviewing movies haha.
/m/how_it_ends_2021	3b957c52-890e-4562-81d5-edb192b0762f	0.5	Oh man is this ever bad. You won't make it through the first thirty minutes. Dreadfully stupid and unfunny.
/m/how_it_ends_2021	3b957c52-890e-4562-81d5-edb192b0762f	4	I paid to stream "How It Ends" even though the review I read advised to wait until it was free. I'm not mad about it. I actually really liked this movie. I think this movie will be one that people either, get and love, or don't at all and hate. I guess I got it. Even though the majority of this film is kind of light and quirky, there are some really poignant moment's and conversations in it that I very much resonated with. Especially between Liza and her younger self. Along with some very funny moments, especially if end of world sarcasm type of humor is your thing. After the last year and a half, I feel like this was a film that we all needed.
/m/how_it_ends_2021	3b957c52-890e-4562-81d5-edb192b0762f	3	She wears acid washed mom jeans through the entire movie. I just can't.
/m/how_it_ends_2021	3b957c52-890e-4562-81d5-edb192b0762f	5	Loved it! So many stars and such a fun, random story about the last day on earth.
/m/how_it_ends_2021	3b957c52-890e-4562-81d5-edb192b0762f	1.5	How It Ends felt like it never ended, drifting from one meaningless conversation to another, Zoe Lister Jones makes the end of the world one where everything is very surreal for its own good, and a pretty long chore to get though.
/m/how_it_ends_2021	3b957c52-890e-4562-81d5-edb192b0762f	5	I liked this movie. I guess I got it. lol
/m/twist_2021	051a7b59-d11a-414e-b3d0-4cb2d18cd058	2	Twist lives up to its title as a modern-day retelling of Oliver Twist, with Michael Caine as Issac "Fagin" Solomon, Rafferty Law as Twist, Lena Headey as Sikes, Rita Ora as Dodge, Noel Clarke as Brownlow, Jason Maza as Bedwin (Clarke and Maza co-produced the film), Franz Drameh as Batesey, Sophie Simnett as Nancy "Red" Leigh, David Walliams as Dr. Crispin Losberne, Dominic Di Tommaso as Tom Chitling and Leigh Francis as Warden Bumble.    The world of Twist is less about pickpockets and more about the world of art theft, parkour and graffiti, so it's definitely a much more modern update, right?  This was directed by Martin Owen, who also made L.A. Slasher, Let's Be Evil and Killers Anonymous. It has the feel of Kingsmen or Now You See Me and if you liked those movies, you'll like this. If you're a stickler for the classics, you surely will not.  Raff Law is, of course, the son of Jude Law and this is a nice way to introduce him to audiences. And it's filled with needle drop songs you obviously know, so there's that was well. It was a pleasant enough way to spend an afternoon, to be fair.
/m/twist_2021	051a7b59-d11a-414e-b3d0-4cb2d18cd058	1.5	Terribile rivisitazione moderna del celebre romanzo di Dickens. Le sequenze di azione sono a dir poco imbarazzanti, girate talmente male da far sembrare il film un progetto di qualche studente senza budget. Le performance attoriali dei ragazzi poi sono di un livello infimo, cosi come la sceneggiatura e quasi tutto il film. Probabilmente un film più adatto ad un pubblico giovane e poco esperto che può divertirsi con qualche accenno di parkour e con un goffo tentativo di creare suspense.
/m/twist_2021	051a7b59-d11a-414e-b3d0-4cb2d18cd058	1	The best thing is the duration. The idea would be right but the interpretation is horrible,and the introduce the topics of the society erasing a natural plot.
/m/twist_2021	051a7b59-d11a-414e-b3d0-4cb2d18cd058	2	A re-imagining of the classic Oliver Twist tale which heavily features free-running! As usual the final plot review is hurried and confusing.
/m/infinitum_subject_unknown	f0b57b6c-04cb-457a-8ab2-445a92038952	1.5	Tedious. Not worth the time.
/m/infinitum_subject_unknown	f0b57b6c-04cb-457a-8ab2-445a92038952	1	If you get past the first 90% the last 10% is also just as annoying.
/m/infinitum_subject_unknown	f0b57b6c-04cb-457a-8ab2-445a92038952	0.5	95% of this movie is watching the protagonist run around confused. Then re-watching her run around confused because she's in a time loop, but literally nothing interesting happens the whole time. Then watching her drive around confused. Then she watches some DVDs confused. And then the "climax" is a spoken explanation that isn't 1/10 as clever as it thinks it is. This is just a bad, pretentious, indulgent student film.  Wish I could take away even the one star I gave it for the fact that it features Ian McKellan prominently in the credits when he has literally 35 seconds of screen time.
/m/infinitum_subject_unknown	f0b57b6c-04cb-457a-8ab2-445a92038952	0.5	What a complete waste of my time.
/m/infinitum_subject_unknown	f0b57b6c-04cb-457a-8ab2-445a92038952	2	While the premise had potential, the ideas in the movie never really materialized into anything. Even the actual "quantum science" behind the premise is a little lack luster
/m/infinitum_subject_unknown	f0b57b6c-04cb-457a-8ab2-445a92038952	2	I'm not sure if I missed something vital with the practically inaudible lines from the disembodied voices and walkie talkie or if the movie just didn't have any answers to begin with. As far as i could tell though, nothing was explained beyond the initial vague and quickly obvious premise. It got increasingly disjointed, then ended. Could have been good. Wasn't.
/m/infinitum_subject_unknown	f0b57b6c-04cb-457a-8ab2-445a92038952	2	The movie has a neat idea but does a bad job at explaining it. The ending is as dissatisfying as all the things we only get to hear, but never to see.  Important lines are almost inaudible, as they are overlayed with glitchy noises or come out of the world's worst walkie talkie.  Also the movie looks very low budget. It's better than your general direct-to-DVD movie, but not by much.  In the end it's frustrating to think what the movie could have been with a bit more budget and some better writing.
/m/infinitum_subject_unknown	f0b57b6c-04cb-457a-8ab2-445a92038952	5	Excellent concept, like a step by step thru quantum physics.
/m/infinitum_subject_unknown	f0b57b6c-04cb-457a-8ab2-445a92038952	0.5	Pointless waste of time for the audience and the people who created it.  Zero story. Zero character development. Just absolutely pointless.
/m/infinitum_subject_unknown	f0b57b6c-04cb-457a-8ab2-445a92038952	0.5	Worst movie EVER!!!!!!!!!
/m/night_drive_2021	29a01354-c48d-319d-a4d3-91037853f05c	4.5	The charm wears bit thin in the middle; and there's a bit of a shark jump with some stupid dialogue, but then it takes off and rolls into a solidly executed thriller with some nice twists and exciting overtones. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
/m/night_drive_2021	29a01354-c48d-319d-a4d3-91037853f05c	3	Slightly amusing thriller about the weird ways a uber driver is trying to survive the night. AJ Bowen delivers a solid performance with a movie that might take too much time to flesh out its premise, but does deliver some nice surprises.
/m/night_drive_2021	29a01354-c48d-319d-a4d3-91037853f05c	0.5	worst movie i ever saw.  no story, total waste of time.
/m/night_drive_2021	29a01354-c48d-319d-a4d3-91037853f05c	3	If you watch it with someone, it has you talking, but it ain't no Primer, put it that way.
/m/american_traitor_the_trial_of_axis_sally	4a2a2ffc-ba80-303e-bc22-dec47d66f526	2	Interesting story, but oof the movie was really bad. Really hope this is not the future of Amazon Prime movies.
/m/american_traitor_the_trial_of_axis_sally	4a2a2ffc-ba80-303e-bc22-dec47d66f526	2.5	NEVER take a commercial film at face value form Hollywood. They always change it for dramtic effect. Among some of the the most perverted films, The Untochables with Sean Connery, and The Immitation Game. This movie is a mild perversion compared to those but painted Sally as harmless when she was much more NAZI than in the movie. If it was more fact based, I would have given it a higher rating as the  acting was so good.  When I watch a movie "Based on a true story", I always go read the history to see what Hollywood did to the "True Story"
/m/american_traitor_the_trial_of_axis_sally	4a2a2ffc-ba80-303e-bc22-dec47d66f526	0.5	This movie treated a willing participant in Nazi Germany as a sympathetic victim with fictitious details and scenes such as Axis Sally getting raped by a Nazi. It's a ridiculous movie and not worth the watch.
/m/american_traitor_the_trial_of_axis_sally	4a2a2ffc-ba80-303e-bc22-dec47d66f526	3.5	I liked the movie. The message, carried most ably by Pacino, completely overshadowed the movie-making trappings that are usually the stock and trade of Hollywood critics. There is a lot of complaint about Meadow Williams performance but I thought she was cast well as a vulnerable, unremarkable, abused war "survivor." These are folks that are usually seen as opportunists rather than victims and get their heads shaved. If I had sat on the jury today I would have let her go; however, I doubt I would have done so at the time - and that was the message of the movie for me. Show trials are likely to be unjust and in the dint of history they are often overturned.
/m/american_traitor_the_trial_of_axis_sally	4a2a2ffc-ba80-303e-bc22-dec47d66f526	0.5	Wow, what an awful movie. Two redeeming qualities, Thomas Kretschmann, who is always outstanding and Carsten Nørgaard, another powerful actor. The lead actress, Meadow Williams is beyond terrible, even her lip syncing is out of sync if that's her singing (I couldn't find details on who sang the songs). Oh yea, the singing is also pretty bad. Meadow's real life beau, Swen Temmel, has a role and is equal to Meadow's performance, in other words, bad. Al Pacino is, well, Al Pacino, but saddled with an awful script, phoning in the part - think And Justice For All on Xanax. In summary, "Warning Will Robinson, danger…."
/m/american_traitor_the_trial_of_axis_sally	4a2a2ffc-ba80-303e-bc22-dec47d66f526	0.5	This movie lost me at a about a minute and a half in.  I listened for a few more minutes to be sure I was giving it a fair shake when I heard a male character refer to a "skill set".  I've lived a long time and never heard that term used until this century.  While that was a linguistic anachronism of the script, the same actor delivering the line pronounced "axis" as "access".  You know, as in "Access Hollywood", and I daresay this movie didn't venture much further than Hollywood in terms of atmosphere or realism.
/m/american_traitor_the_trial_of_axis_sally	4a2a2ffc-ba80-303e-bc22-dec47d66f526	0.5	My god, as a lifelong Pacino fan: how the mighty have fallen. Apart from the terrible, terrible acting, and the flat script, it was really, really hard to watch a effing Nazi (and yes, read up about her she was a Nazi) laugh her way out of the court. Yes, it did happen in real life, but why glorify a Nazi?! As far as her "torture" in the hands of Goebbel, well I refuse to believe it. You make the bed you sleep in. What a pathetic excuse for a movie!
/m/american_traitor_the_trial_of_axis_sally	4a2a2ffc-ba80-303e-bc22-dec47d66f526	0.5	Miserably bad acting, most particularly from Pacino, who mailed in another one.
/m/american_traitor_the_trial_of_axis_sally	4a2a2ffc-ba80-303e-bc22-dec47d66f526	1.5	A very flat courtroom movie.  As expected, the entire movie was a setup for Pacino's final speech in his closing argument  Perhaps, many years ago he might have had the energy and verve to pull off the performance.  Now, there is only the shadow of the potential of the performance that might have salvaged the movie.  From a historical perspective, the subject matter should have been left to the documentarians.
/m/american_traitor_the_trial_of_axis_sally	4a2a2ffc-ba80-303e-bc22-dec47d66f526	1	One of the worst movies I've seen.
/m/the_loneliest_whale_the_search_for_52	725ba4f0-5029-3d69-9828-51832777775b	2.5	The 52-Hertz whale is a fascinating story of an animal that may be the only of its kind, but Joshua Zeman's documentary in which he makes himself the star (at times) is an absolute mess.  Filled with B roll and whale footage that isn't 52, it's lingers between a nature doc and tangents that don't fit.  The players searching for the whale are genuine, as is the quest, but the footage used is at best confusing and at worst disingenuous.  If you're interested in the whale and it's backstory give it a shot, but this could have been done in an hour and feels unnecessarily stretched to 97 minutes.  You will get some really great insight, but again it's muddled by another Werner Herzog wannabe.  Final Score: 5.3/10
/m/the_loneliest_whale_the_search_for_52	725ba4f0-5029-3d69-9828-51832777775b	4	The search for connection is something that we all understand, not only as a social practice, but also as a personal and collective need. So, when we hear about an individual who is unable to fulfill that requirement, we're often saddened by this deficiency, regardless of whether this circumstance involves a human or some other creature. Such is the case for a believed-hybrid whale that sings its songs on a unique frequency, making it fundamentally unable to communicate with its peers and causing it to labeled as the ultimate social outcast. This has thus led to the emergence of a mythology sentimentally celebrated in story and even song, all backed by an abundance of empathy for this loner of the deep, a creature that has come to be known as "the loneliest whale." The search for this elusive cetacean provides the focus of filmmaker Joshua Zeman's captivating new documentary, which shares the story of this solitary specimen and the long-shot expedition launched to find it. The film generally tells the tale in a beautifully filmed and engaging vehicle, though it has unfortunate tendencies to slip off into tangents that are awkwardly introduced and to insert annoying, somewhat self-aggrandizing observations from the director/narrator, intrusions that needlessly impede the flow of the narrative. Nevertheless, this offering also draws a number of relevant and pertinent parallels between the human condition and that of the lonely whale and its kindreds, metaphorical parables that we had all better heed if we hope to save the whales -- and ourselves.
/m/the_loneliest_whale_the_search_for_52	725ba4f0-5029-3d69-9828-51832777775b	3.5	Interesting enough to watch but ultimately a little light on the actual whale we all wanted to see. Full review on vanessasnonspoilers.com
/m/the_loneliest_whale_the_search_for_52	725ba4f0-5029-3d69-9828-51832777775b	5	Wow!!!! I had no knowledge of anything about whales before going into this, but is was an absolute emotional rollercoaster. The cinematography was also beautiful. Makes me want to go out on the ocean....
/m/the_loneliest_whale_the_search_for_52	725ba4f0-5029-3d69-9828-51832777775b	5	A stunning must-watch for any nature lovers.
/m/the_loneliest_whale_the_search_for_52	725ba4f0-5029-3d69-9828-51832777775b	5	Very well done.  I really enjoyed it.
/m/the_loneliest_whale_the_search_for_52	725ba4f0-5029-3d69-9828-51832777775b	3.5	I really enjoyed this movie. It had great photography and told an interesting story. I just wished it had done a better job of explaining how whales respond to the song of another whale of the same species and how they believe there could be two '52' whales.
/m/the_loneliest_whale_the_search_for_52	725ba4f0-5029-3d69-9828-51832777775b	5	We have so much work to do. Studying and protecting whales. humans are so dumb.
/m/the_loneliest_whale_the_search_for_52	725ba4f0-5029-3d69-9828-51832777775b	4	intriguing to learn about the human interaction, etc with Whale
/m/the_loneliest_whale_the_search_for_52	725ba4f0-5029-3d69-9828-51832777775b	5	Loved the enthusiasm and dynamic energy of the scientist and crew from beginning to end. The thrill of the chase spurs the audience to become encapsulated in the mystery itself, finding joy in every revelation and setback. For a project outside of his usual wheelhouse, Zeman brilliantly fuses empathic tones of awareness for these beautiful creates with the fascination that comes from chasing a great mystery.
/m/settlers_2021	8e24a5e7-ad6d-3192-be4a-42faa05597e5	2.5	Nothing like Mars here, the slow, long-winding pace just makes me sleepy. Never settle with the settlers
/m/settlers_2021	8e24a5e7-ad6d-3192-be4a-42faa05597e5	1	It started out interesting then quickly got boring. Oh and they kill a pig. And then it was slow, slow, slow, it was such a waste of time and budget.
/m/settlers_2021	8e24a5e7-ad6d-3192-be4a-42faa05597e5	5	I loved it. I don't understand how so many people hated it but who cares. To me, this is one of the best films of 2021. Minimalistic, smart, melancholic and suspenseful. Two thumbs up.
/m/settlers_2021	8e24a5e7-ad6d-3192-be4a-42faa05597e5	4	A slow-burn, unforgiving sci fi western.    It fizzles out towards the end, mainly because the reproductive drive of Jerry that ultimately proves fatal is not very well established. I do commend, however, the attempt at pushing serious themes like revenge, abuse and colonialism all within an extreme scenario that seems to push all characters towards the inhumane.   It is doomed to be less than appreciated by moviegoers accustomed to epic finales,  closed endings and manichean characters.
/m/settlers_2021	8e24a5e7-ad6d-3192-be4a-42faa05597e5	1	If you took the set, actors, budget, and just started over with a completely different story, you could make a great movie. This movie is terrible. I love low-budget, "cerebral" sci-fi. It's low-budget at least.
/m/settlers_2021	8e24a5e7-ad6d-3192-be4a-42faa05597e5	2	Despite its solid cast and production design, it's a movie full of plot holes and an ending that will leave you scratching your head.
/m/settlers_2021	8e24a5e7-ad6d-3192-be4a-42faa05597e5	5	Do not listen to the crap others tell you. THIS MOVIE IS AN ACTUAL BANGER. Why so?  While it may be a little disturbing, it brings an incredible storyline out to the world. As a fan of many awesome sci-fi films, such as Interstellar, Geostorm and Oblivion, I can clearly state that this movie has a completely different and unique view of everything. While bringing apocalyptic signs and marks to what could've happened in the past, it feeds you an interesting storyline of a child going through many traumatic events, while standing strong.  The actors are amazing, the storyline doesn't die off and many unexpecting things happen during the film. I absolutely suggest everyone to watch the film to open their field of view to all characters and see everyone's point in the story.   Remember, it's just a film. A film, that stands out from the rest by its courage and boldness.
/m/settlers_2021	8e24a5e7-ad6d-3192-be4a-42faa05597e5	2	Dull sci-fi/drama that starts out well, but loses grip with quickly by removing the interesting main players for some rather contrived relationship/stockholm syndrom type nonsense.
/m/settlers_2021	8e24a5e7-ad6d-3192-be4a-42faa05597e5	1	Pointless tedium. Fifteen minutes of not very interesting story spread out of nearly two hours. Purely self-indulgent student movie.
/m/settlers_2021	8e24a5e7-ad6d-3192-be4a-42faa05597e5	4.5	Nuanced, plausible, directed with flair and with a string cast, Settlers is an intruiging SF drama about the human condition. Harsh but poetic.

The plot, filled with foreboding, kept you guessing until the very end. Many will probably find the end unsatisfying, but I like how it did not adhere to formula.
/m/the_nest_2021	db84622c-efaa-3a0f-97d2-62da87fd0d42	3	The film's unresolved ending, which was like the ending of the TV series "The Sopranos," is the reason for my 3-star rating. Unlike The Sopranos, there is not enough depth to the film to warrant such an ending. It felt like the director lost interest or focus and just stopped. The characters and the threads their stories contribute to the film's overall story are compelling and deserve better.
/m/the_nest_2021	db84622c-efaa-3a0f-97d2-62da87fd0d42	3.5	A mother's reality erodes around her as she struggles to fathom the entangled web of her daughter's separation anxiety brought on by parasitic creatures within a stuffed bear in The Nest, a super creepy atmospheric film that will trigger your ‘oh this is going to be strange' alarms straight from the offset.  Written by Jennifer Trudrung and directed by James Suttles, The Nest (also known as The Bewailing) has a great cast (including genre favourite Dee Wallace as Marrisa) and a fantastic performance by Maple Suttles as ‘Meg' ‘The Nest' is a beautiful film to watch and listen to (with a very haunting score by Neil Lee Griffin ( Dusk Series) which will keep those nerves on the very edge. To review The Nest is a tricky one, especially without spoilers but lets just say that after watching this film, you wont ever feel the need to pick up a bear at a yard sale. Just don't!!! Don't do it!  So if you like your films creepy, atmospheric and one that will get under your skin, do check it out! Even more so if you have a child who perhaps….might just be behaving a little differently than they used to.
/m/the_nest_2021	db84622c-efaa-3a0f-97d2-62da87fd0d42	5	This is an absolute masterpiece of horror, shat from the brain-butt of David Cronenberg. A sister piece, I believe, of Mike Flanagan's Absentia(2011).  I fear that many will look at the teddy-bear aspect and make the mistake of approaching this film as camp. I think folks look for reasons to laugh off truly great horror, because they are afraid of being afraid.   What is so remarkable about this work is that the fear is driven (more than any horror film I have ever seen, I think) by the most masterful acting. "I need you to be my queen."   I shudder now at the memory of my first viewing, 2 days ago. And I hope I will dream about it tonight. Like I did, so long ago, after defying my parents and watching The Brood. Because I LOVE nightmares.
/m/the_nest_2021	db84622c-efaa-3a0f-97d2-62da87fd0d42	0.5	Entertaining a bit but after watch until end Queen come at the ending scene further how doesn't the parasite born without Queen that a stupid movie is it from toys??
/m/the_nest_2021	db84622c-efaa-3a0f-97d2-62da87fd0d42	1	awful. i like the premise, but this is not good.
/m/the_nest_2021	db84622c-efaa-3a0f-97d2-62da87fd0d42	2	Creepy but not by any means original premise and not bad ending, but a laborious slog getting there. Fifteen minutes of plot turned into an hour and a half of mega-boredom.
/m/the_nest_2021	db84622c-efaa-3a0f-97d2-62da87fd0d42	3	A film that offers more to the parasite horror movie sub-genre than it will be given credit for. Largely to blame is the title's sluggish nature and blown-out run-time.  There is a lot at play when it comes to the human side of The Nest and for that, it deserves to be seen.

/m/the_nest_2021	db84622c-efaa-3a0f-97d2-62da87fd0d42	1.5	Wow, this is one seriously slow, pointless, boring film. The plot was aimless for so long, the music was relentless, and the payoff could not save the first 90 minutes of this movie. The performers did a fine job, and the film looked okay, it was just really boring, and rarely creepy or scary.
/m/midnight_in_the_switchgrass	88b0531c-4e20-316e-a907-defe093d0645	5	The villain is known to the audience, almost instantly, nevertheless, there is no way to tell the outcome of this story (even though the hope for the best does't let go along the way). The screenplay can always go otherwise. Personally, I loved the way it ended, as we had enough of dark stuff for the past couple of years. Good old boys are on the watch... Just felt bad about that little girl as her world collapsed and she had no clue of what was up... Well, her mother looked adequate, so luckily they both manage to get over... Great cast, great act, following Emile Hirsch since Alpha Dog - lots of changes. Just don't be a snob. Get a couple of beers or something else up to a preference and dive in
/m/midnight_in_the_switchgrass	88b0531c-4e20-316e-a907-defe093d0645	1.5	This crime movie was terrible. Megan Fox, Bruce Willis, Emile Hirsch, Lukas Haas, and the rest of the cast did a terrible job in this movie. The plot of the movie was tedious and pathetic. Everyone in this movie underacted and there should've been a better plan to try and capture the serial killer. If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't waste your time. You'll hate it.
/m/midnight_in_the_switchgrass	88b0531c-4e20-316e-a907-defe093d0645	5	Loved it. Riveting. On the edge of my seat the entire time. Great story line,...Great acting all round. I have no F- ing idea why the low tomato meter and low audience score. Oh well. Great mystery-Thriller !!!!!
/m/midnight_in_the_switchgrass	88b0531c-4e20-316e-a907-defe093d0645	2	I don't really get how it happens...when you have some good talent that doesn't read the script. Bruce is a cop that's phasing out, and Fox is hungry to catch some killers. The antagonist is a religious weirdo that captures and kills girls.
/m/midnight_in_the_switchgrass	88b0531c-4e20-316e-a907-defe093d0645	1.5	Little slow at times and I was expecting to see Bruce Willis in a star roll but was less than impressed. It feels like he is in these past two movies to give them some credibility but he really doesn’t do much for the story line. Disappointing
/m/midnight_in_the_switchgrass	88b0531c-4e20-316e-a907-defe093d0645	4.5	Megan Fox. Her best movie of the year.
/m/midnight_in_the_switchgrass	88b0531c-4e20-316e-a907-defe093d0645	2.5	Not worth the price we paid to watch but I've seen worse.  Colson Baker (aka MGK) can act, he was very convincing.  Meghan Fox has gotten better over the years.  Bruce Willis just looked tired.  The overall story screenplay was not written or directed well so the story got a bit lost.  It's okay to watch if you just saw everything else and are COVID bored.
/m/midnight_in_the_switchgrass	88b0531c-4e20-316e-a907-defe093d0645	1	Just a brainless murder mystery story with some truly lousy acting from most of this usually capable cast, that tries to be edgy by placing its story in the south, but just brings out memories to better crime movies from the past like ´The Onion Field or Texas Killing Fields´.
/m/midnight_in_the_switchgrass	88b0531c-4e20-316e-a907-defe093d0645	0.5	Bruce Willis was not in this movie. He's terrible. And we would have watched it even without him on the cover.
/m/midnight_in_the_switchgrass	88b0531c-4e20-316e-a907-defe093d0645	0.5	Save yourself the hour and 45 minutes. Knit a sweater, go for a walk, give your dog a bath, or go get a tooth pulled. Any of those things would be more entertaining.   Besides the fact that the movie itself was terrible, the acting was atrocious.   It gives a whole new meaning to ‘disaster movie'
/m/ride_the_eagle	ebaaba7e-ca5c-3567-a0af-b82e9bdcf0e9	2	Started watching the movie expecting it to be a bit more stupid then it was. Only issue is they overdid the emotional parts making it very boring to watch. Slept through the middle part of it, easy to catch up on at the end. Good movie for the feelings but it's worse then a science class in high school for boringness.
/m/ride_the_eagle	ebaaba7e-ca5c-3567-a0af-b82e9bdcf0e9	3	3.1 Jake Johnson never disappoints in delivering and easy and enjoyable movie
/m/ride_the_eagle	ebaaba7e-ca5c-3567-a0af-b82e9bdcf0e9	2	While "Ride the Eagle" had a few good moments and laughs, it was off kilter in not having a coherent plot line that held together. I guy has been estranged from his mother most of his life and suddenly he's going to take life instructions - and some pretty crazy ones - that she left to him on a video before she died?! Didn't work for me.
/m/ride_the_eagle	ebaaba7e-ca5c-3567-a0af-b82e9bdcf0e9	1	PG-13, I think not!  I am not a prude but I disagree with the rating for this movie.  Based on the preview it looked like a sweet and funny movie.  The excessive use of the F word, phone sex dialog, and J.K.Simmsons' character going into detail about the taste of his recently deceased gf's vagina was cringey.  None of it added any value to the story and it would have been better without it.  We made the mistake of watching it with our 16yo son.  It was an uncomfortable watch for all of us!
/m/ride_the_eagle	ebaaba7e-ca5c-3567-a0af-b82e9bdcf0e9	3	Funny, unique funny, and charming at points. Okay movie, but nothing great.
/m/ride_the_eagle	ebaaba7e-ca5c-3567-a0af-b82e9bdcf0e9	0.5	Good premise, but cannot be kept afloat by script or film. Too many dead zones zzz Cut movie length back to about 1/4 and story would not be lost at all.  Susan Sarandon tries with lots of f* words to make us chuckle. She looks as tired as that ruse.
/m/ride_the_eagle	ebaaba7e-ca5c-3567-a0af-b82e9bdcf0e9	3.5	This is a fun take on how new age families deal with the impending death that chases all of us.
/m/ride_the_eagle	ebaaba7e-ca5c-3567-a0af-b82e9bdcf0e9	1.5	Decent idea but amateur execution. One of the slowest movies I've ever seen. Felt like an eternity, kept looking at my watch every 10 minutes thinking at least 30 minutes must have gone by. For a film under 90 min, ouch, find something more engaging.
/m/ride_the_eagle	ebaaba7e-ca5c-3567-a0af-b82e9bdcf0e9	2	I wanted so bad to love this movie. It's my kind of movie. Even my mom is known as Honey. But, this movie was just lousy. Even with Susan Sarandon as the brilliant mom. Sad that such a great story couldn't have been told better.
/m/ride_the_eagle	ebaaba7e-ca5c-3567-a0af-b82e9bdcf0e9	5	Sad, funny, and heartfelt. Loved it!
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_two	d8036259-7dea-3847-aa2e-c88fda77e9ca	5	Tenia miedo que después de la gran primera parte esta me decepcione pero por suerte no fue así. Mantiene el mismo ritmo de la primera en todo momento, de las mejores que saco dc en los últimos tiempos. Por mas películas así, incluso aunque tengan que dividirlas en 2 partes como en esta ocasión.
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_two	d8036259-7dea-3847-aa2e-c88fda77e9ca	4.5	The follow up to part one, released just a month afterwards, is out and is set to finish off the story of The Long Halloween. I was a huge fan of the first film and it intrigued me, played with my expectations, was beautifully animated, and smartly written. The credit scene for that filmed proved to be very important to the intro to this film so I'm glad I watched it. I'm not going to waste too much space with the introduction. I watched these both back to back and it's obviously a continuing story.  One of the things I loved most about the first film was that the characters were given intriguing arcs to them, especially Harvey Dent and his wife Gilda. We see the strain on her from Harvey being busy all the time and there's hints of aggression or something more going on with him. Batman had his first failure as a detective which resulted in someone's death. It was all very well handled and written. This movie continues with the holiday murders and Bruce under the control of poison ivy as seen in the credit scene. More murders are carried out and when Catwoman finally is able to break him free from poison ivy, he resumes his investigation. It's revealed that his father once saved the life of Carmon Falcone, who most of the deaths have been linked to his crime family. This gives us hints that maybe the Wayne family wasn't as all good as they were imaged to be. Perhaps Bruce isn't doing what he's doing to protect the image of what they stood for, instead to accomplish the image they strove for. As for Harvey, in the midst of the murders, he's dealing with his own demons and during the hearing of one of the Maroni members, things go wrong. After agreeing to testify for immunity, Dent is accused by Maroni of being Holiday and Maroni throws acid in his face. Dent is hospitalized but escapes and is picked up by Falcone's men. Dent kills his guards and flees into the sewers, where he is nurtured by Solomon Grundy. It's there where the voices in his head become more clear, as he stated with his double head coin in the first film that "two heads are better than one", he has now become Two-Face. This unfortunately leads me to my only issue with the movie and that's the involvement of the other Batman villains. Personally, I didn't really need them in the film as much as they were. It wasn't like they were bad because they certainly weren't. Everyone was animated well, voice acting was great, I just thought this story would've worked better with the focus solely being on who's already involved with the story. I like Joker's involvement in the last film but in this one with the other villains, I felt derailed the script a bit. There were still some shocking turns in the story and the way things progressed was very well handled.  I particularly loved the ending of the film and how the killer was revealed as well as who it was. I made a guess late in the second film who it was and I was right but of course had no idea what the motive could've been. The way the movie revealed its killer and their motive was nothing short of fantastic. One of the things so many whodunit's get wrong and lazy is who the killer ends up being. Most recently Knives Out did it very well, though that film made it too obvious as to who it was, but gave the killer a good motive. This one in particular stands out as one of the best that I've seen personally. The scene itself and how it was made was also excellent. No music whatsoever, just dialogue with silence in the background. A lot of scenes in both of these films are like that which I really appreciate. It makes this story as a whole feel more grounded and personal and when we find out what the motive was, the personal aspect of it shines above all. Like with Batman Hush, the inclusion of so many Batman villains made the movie feel bigger than it realistically should have felt. Only it was just in bits and pieces. The final confrontation in particular was fantastic and a certain subplot wrapping up was well handled. Afterwards is where the reveal happens and I absolutely loved it.  Though overall I liked Part One better on its own, but as a whole story, this was an excellent tale. One of the better Batman one's that I've seen for sure. It may not reach the overall level of quality of The Dark Knight Returns and Under the Red Hood, but it's still a solid story. I encourage anyone, even if you're not a big fan of comics to give it a watch. Of course, if you love and know Batman your experience will be a lot better, but even for casual fans it's a solid story. Oh, and the credit scene confirms that Superman: Man of Tomorrow and Justice Society: World War II are connected with this story. This is shaping up to be the next DC Animated Universe of movies after the events of Justice League Dark: Apokolips War and I'm very excited for what's to come. I'm going to give Batman: The Long Halloween Part Two, an A-
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_two	d8036259-7dea-3847-aa2e-c88fda77e9ca	3.5	The second part of this adaptation suffers from a lot of unnecessary diversions with Batman's rogues gallery, the detective story is placed on the backburner for much of the runtime and the climax becomes excessive and unfocused with too many characters involved. This padding raises the question of why the story was stretched over two 90 minute movies when a single two to two-and-a-half film would have been tighter. The central mystery remains compelling and some much needed emotional weight is added by looking at the relationship between the Wayne and Falcone families, but its solution becomes less and less important as other elements take over, something that didn't happen in the comic despite its diversions. Taken together The Long Halloween 2-parter is a solid adaptation, bolstered by high production values, but with a few teaks could have been even better.
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_two	d8036259-7dea-3847-aa2e-c88fda77e9ca	5	This is one of the best movies ever it has action suspense and a good reveal of the killer it does what killing joke doesn't it adapts a graphic novel well.
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_two	d8036259-7dea-3847-aa2e-c88fda77e9ca	5	Love this movie! Ackles was wonderful as Batman and the ending was a surprise.
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_two	d8036259-7dea-3847-aa2e-c88fda77e9ca	4.5	A solid ending to a great new Batman storyline.
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_two	d8036259-7dea-3847-aa2e-c88fda77e9ca	0.5	Spoiler alert!!!  -  The script goes off script.  The idiot (re)writers decided to change the original, and infinitely better storyline, with one of their own.  I am just so glad I didn't pay to rent, or God forbid, buy this without seeing it first.   Here are the problems: 1)  Three different times other characters tell Batman that he's not a very good detective, and once Batman tells Alfred that he didn't know he would have to be a detective  -  Batman's origin is from DC (Detective Comics) and he is touted as the "World's Greatest Detective".   2)  The antagonist is shown to be a man both in height, build, and athleticism - Turns out the rewrite flips the script and decides that it's a woman.  A frail, skinny, and short woman! 3)  Batman, the guy whose motto is "Justice, not vengeance" decides to allow the woman, who has killed around a dozen people over the course of the last year, to destroy evidence that would ultimately find her guilty, but also takes her word for it that she's not going to kill again because "It's over." - Just stupid. 4)  There are multiple ambiguous characters that are included, but literally add nothing to the story.  In fact they detract from the story for the sole purpose of attempting to be clever in misdirecting the viewer to some other antagonist - Huge fail. In all this was a terrible rewrite, and should be sent to the dumpster along The New Mutants.
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_two	d8036259-7dea-3847-aa2e-c88fda77e9ca	1.5	Part 1 was enjoyable I did enjoy it. But Part 2 screwed up I mean really Gilda Dent NO! In the comic it was Alberto not Gilda this has to be one of the most biggest screw ups DC Comics Animated Movies have produced!
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_two	d8036259-7dea-3847-aa2e-c88fda77e9ca	4.5	The mystery of the Holiday killer continues  Part Two picks up 3 months after where Part One left off  Batman hasn't had any luck tracking this murderer's whereabouts and bodies keep piling up  Poison Ivy has been hypnotizing Bruce Wayne and Mad Hatter and Scarecrow have escaped Arkham Asylum  The trail seems to be going cold solving these killings and Batman is running low on suspects  All we get is what we take, is justice a double-sided coin, is there only innocent and guilty for all, when will the sins of the fathers stop following us, is the good guys winning worth it? This second part of the comic adaptation is bigger and better with higher stakes, more characters, and quite the sad twist once the Holiday killer is revealed  Everything ties back together in more corrupt ways  The middle does kinda sag a bit with all the familial connections but the piecing of the puzzle pieces is worth the viewing  There's impressive character development to go with the comic booky elements  The Dark Knight shines again with a worthy animated feature full of mystery, intrigue, violence, death, and unmasking true monsters
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_two	d8036259-7dea-3847-aa2e-c88fda77e9ca	5	the dreary year comes to an end and yes, it was Gotham gloomy......and a glorious Knight
/m/here_after_2021	3bd9173d-2307-3a6e-acdf-1e64bbb3957e	1.5	I really wanted this movie to be good...  but it was so bad....    bad in ways that it is painful to watch.
/m/val	40bf904f-7f47-4049-83aa-74e34986bf6d	3.5	You kinda want to play the saddest song with the smallest violin, for a movie star born into a wealthy family... but... at the end of it, with all the self made footage, the documentary is an interesting look about the man behind the actor. And to be an A24, magically gains half a star more.
/m/val	40bf904f-7f47-4049-83aa-74e34986bf6d	5	Movie Rating:  10/10
/m/val	40bf904f-7f47-4049-83aa-74e34986bf6d	4.5	Val (Amazon Prime) is a documentary about Val Kilmer and staggeringly well done.  The vast majority of the film is made up of the footage Val shot himself from childhood onward of just about everything.  It is movie about acting sure....but becomes more about the power of faith and art than the movies.  Many of the "faith made" movies of the last few years could learn a lot from this one.  It has its faults as it a story told with little push back and very narrow view (it would have been interesting to have others push back a little.  It is joyful, silly, nostalgic, and sad and one of the better movies of the year.  4 1/2 stars out of 5.
/m/val	40bf904f-7f47-4049-83aa-74e34986bf6d	4	An intimate look at Vals life, and the great journey itself.
/m/val	40bf904f-7f47-4049-83aa-74e34986bf6d	4.5	Val - 9/10. Val Kilmer is the focus of this documentary that compiles home footage that he and his son have captured over the years. Compiling his life story and throwing some gut wrenching moments in the process, the documentary follows Kilmer as he struggles to cope with his throat cancer and also trying to reconcile with how his career has gone for the most part. A touching and tough documentary to watch, it offers fans of the actor and fans of filmmaking a different and interesting take on how movies and Hollywood work. Whats very insightful about the documentary is that we see so much revealed by the actor. His inspiration for making the film is to make a movie about acting, yet, makes a movie about a person who wants to do things his way. He lives and does things in a way that most people won't understand. Many have short sighted and called him mercurial or hard to work with, when really he's just a person whose ambition is to give his best. Its an eye opening doc for anyone unaware of what he has gone through the last few years. An amazing and great documentary and insight into a talented actor!
/m/val	40bf904f-7f47-4049-83aa-74e34986bf6d	4	One of the best autobiographical documentaries I've seen. This is the definition of introspection. I was never a huge Val Kilmer fan despite his being in some movies I like.  This documentary uncovers a side of him that's truly fascinating, intriguing, and enigmatic. It's a profound meditation on the human condition, something nobody on this planet is immune too.
/m/val	40bf904f-7f47-4049-83aa-74e34986bf6d	5	Val Kilmer is one of the best actors of his generation. His portrayal of Doc Holiday and Jim Morrison are two of the greatest performances on film.  So great you can't even imagine anyone else playing those parts. He did a great job with this self reflective deeply interspective documentary of his life. Val doesn't cut any corners and it shows the good, but also the bad..warts, tragedies and all. This documentary will make you appreciate Val Kilmer even more. One of the things that really make this documentary even more sincere and special is that his son is the narrator. That's pretty darn cool.
/m/val	40bf904f-7f47-4049-83aa-74e34986bf6d	5	Very powerful film worth every minute.
/m/val	40bf904f-7f47-4049-83aa-74e34986bf6d	5	Val Kilmer has a story to tell worth telling.  I enjoyed seeing the various footage of different times in his life. His early life and seeing his talent at such a young age was really fascinating.  It did make me sad seeing him say that he felt embarrassed at times like he is selling his former self to fans at comic cons and such, but honestly as a 90's kid I would disagree.  I feel like fans don't expect him to be anything but what he is, and we are there in humble gratitude for the movies that are a part of our cinematic history.
/m/val	40bf904f-7f47-4049-83aa-74e34986bf6d	4.5	Must see!  Incredible documentary.  Very enjoyable and entertaining!
/m/a_dark_foe	a8f7424a-3d8c-3312-a22a-d439dff976a5	4.5	I'm positive this movie will haunt me for days or even weeks. I am also sure it will keep people debating about for some time to come. For me, it is a well-done film that was emotionally pulverizing for me as viewer as it was for the characters.
/m/a_dark_foe	a8f7424a-3d8c-3312-a22a-d439dff976a5	1.5	Hot garbage. So terrible I stopped watching around 45 minutes in.
/m/a_dark_foe	a8f7424a-3d8c-3312-a22a-d439dff976a5	4.5	A Dark Foe packs a punch! With every murder more disturbing than the previous one, no one prepared me for the shocking poetic justice at the end.
/m/a_dark_foe	a8f7424a-3d8c-3312-a22a-d439dff976a5	2	Once again, I got duped again by woke reviewing. This movie isn’t the worst thing ever made, but within 5 minutes you’ll see that Oscar Cardenas’ performance is reminiscent of Tommy Wiseau’s in the room. Is he wearing a wig? Has he acted before? Has he ever held a gun? Is he trying to hide his accent? What is happening?!! Be wary when a producer puts himself in a movie.
/m/a_dark_foe	a8f7424a-3d8c-3312-a22a-d439dff976a5	0.5	Don’t watch this movie!!  Good reviews are fake! It is not even a bad B movie.
/m/a_dark_foe	a8f7424a-3d8c-3312-a22a-d439dff976a5	0.5	It is ridiculous that this has a 98% rate rotten. Goes to show how reliable this site is. The movie is pretty bad. Stiff acting. Poor dialogue. Really bad script.
/m/a_dark_foe	a8f7424a-3d8c-3312-a22a-d439dff976a5	4.5	A good neo-noir, stylistic film. Plot was a little slow starting of but really picked up into something big. Ending was good too
/m/a_dark_foe	a8f7424a-3d8c-3312-a22a-d439dff976a5	5	Intense and thrilling... A Dark Foe really does have everything you would want from a thriller.
/m/a_dark_foe	a8f7424a-3d8c-3312-a22a-d439dff976a5	4.5	Really entertaining and a well made independent movie
/m/a_dark_foe	a8f7424a-3d8c-3312-a22a-d439dff976a5	4	Good pop corn thriller. Loved the gore and plot twists that go back and forth.
/m/rose_plays_julie	c761f885-5054-35a8-af02-12efcd96b5e5	1	This film was one of the worst I've gone to see in the cinema this year, attempted art is a fair description I feel, slow paced, boring with an over use of moody music, solemn landscapes and characters staring into the distance.  Everybody in this film lives in an impossibly upper middle class world, from the student that can just jet off to London on a whim, to the actress who gave her up as a baby who lives in a London Mansion, and on to the rapist archeologist father who again lives in a Mansion but this time in Ireland.  Finally the ending was an atrocity, to take away the control from the female and give it to the male seems ridiculous at this point, you may as well take all the power from the female characters and tell them to get back into their place as the male character makes the final decision and controls the end narrative.  I cant recommend this one and will avoid it like the plague when it inevitably appears on our RTE screens regularly over the next few years as they try and claw back their investment money.
/m/rose_plays_julie	c761f885-5054-35a8-af02-12efcd96b5e5	2	American audiences, for some reason, cannot get enough drama in their lives nowadays.  A quick run through the broadcast and cable ranks, and even the streaming options out there serves well to support that statement.  The same applies in looking at all the dramas that fill the cinematic realm, too.  To that end, Film Movement did its part this past July to give American audiences their drama fix when it brought the independent drama Rose Plays Julie to DVD.  Originally released in 2019 in Ireland and the United Kingdom through Desperate Optimists and Samson Films, the movie is an interesting though imperfect presentation that ultimately would be a good fit for Lifetime Movie Network's lineup.  That is due in large part to its story, which will be discussed shortly.  While the story is interesting, its pacing proves extremely problematic.  This will be discussed a little later.  The background information provided by Film Movement and the movie's co-directors in the DVD's packaging works with the movie's story to give it at least a little more interest.  It will also be examined later.  Each item noted is important in its own way to the whole of the movie's presentation.  All things considered, they make Rose Plays Julie worth watching at least once.  Desperate Optimists/Samson Films' 2019 drama Rose Plays Julie is a good option for American audiences who just cannot seem to get enough drama in their lives.  It is an especially good selection for audiences who are loyal to Lifetime and Lifetime Movie Network.  That is proven in large part through the movie's story.  The story in question centers on young Rose (Ann Skelly – The Nevers, Red Rock, Kissing Candice) as she goes down the proverbial rabbit hole in search of her birth parents.  The story opens with Rose knowing the identity of her birth mother, but not that of her birth father, nor the circumstances under which she was conceived.  When her birth mother, Ellen (Orla Brady – Star Trek Picard, Fringe, Into The Badlands) reveals those circumstances, it sends Rose over the edge so to speak.  She learns the identity of her birth father – Peter (Aiden Gillen – The Dark Knight Rises, Game of Thrones, Maze Runner: The Death Cure) – and takes on a heavy plan.  As Rose and Peter get to know one another, Peter proves to be every bit the despicable figure that Rose imagined as he tries to rape her, not knowing she is his daughter.  He does not know because of the act that she takes on to find him.  One should digress here, Rose is so disgusted by Peter prior to his attempted rape of her that she had decided she was going to do something drastic (what she plans to do it pretty unsurprising, but at the same time, she cannot be blamed for wanting to do him in).  When she ends up not killing Peter, someone else does.  It does not take a genius to know who does.  To that end, how it happens will be left for audiences to learn for themselves.  Given, Peter deserved what he got.  At the same time though, it is all so formulaic.  It is, again, everything that audiences expect from a typical Lifetime and Lifetime Movie Network presentation.  That is not to say that it is not worth watching.  Thanks to the actually believable work of the movie's cast, audiences will actually find themselves remaining engaged and entertained, even though they know what is coming.  To that end, the story does make this movie worth watching at least once.  While the story featured in Rose Plays Julie makes the movie at least somewhat appealing, the story's pacing detracts greatly from that appeal.  The movie's run time is listed at one hour, 40 minutes.  The thing is that because of the pacing, which drags almost consistently throughout the movie, that run time feels so much longer.  What it is that makes the pacing move so slowly is difficult to pinpoint.  Maybe it is the general lack of any musical backing to help establish much emotional connection from scene to scene.  Maybe it is all of the exposition from scene to scene.  Maybe it is both of those items or something else altogether.  Regardless of what ultimately causes the pacing to drag so consistently, that problem ultimately makes watching the movie extremely difficult.  If not for the ability of the story and the cast to keep audiences engaged, that issue would be the proverbial last straw for the presentation.  Luckily, there is still one more aspect in this movie's domestic presentation that keeps it from being a complete failure.  That aspect is the background provided about the movie in the DVD's packaging.  Co-Directors Christine Molloy and Joe Lawlor point out in their comments in the movie's notes, that the movie was originally made with the intent to examine the impact of rape on victims beyond just the emotional and psychological.  Understanding this, it makes the story timely, especially what with the matter of abortion being in the headlines so much lately.  The duo adds that it just so happened that the MeToo movement just started to take hold in the U.K. as the movie's production neared its end.  So in other words, this movie was not part of that movement.  That actually makes suspension of disbelief easier.  That ability of audiences to not feel preached at in turn leads to more insurance of viewers' engagement and entertainment.   The added note by Film Movement that the company chose to bring the movie to American audiences because of its psychological nature will resonate with audiences, too.  Again that avoidance of any promotion of preachy-ness even in these notes means that the attention was placed on the movie's intrinsic value.  Once more, that audiences do not received any of that sense of being preached at means even more that they are likely to remain engaged and entertained.  Keeping that in mind along with the interest generated through the Co-Directors' comments and through the story itself, the movie ultimately proves to be worth seeing at least once.  That is even with the issue of the movie's pacing taken into account.  Film Movement's domestic presentation of Desperate Optimisits/Samson Films' Rose Plays Julie is an intriguing addition to this year's field of new domestically-released independent movies.  Its intrigue comes in part through its story.  The story follows a young woman who is driven to the brink of committing a heinous act as she learns the circumstances surrounding her conception and birth.  The serious matter that is approached here is what makes it so engaging.  The work of the movie's cast is even more so to credit to keeping viewers' attention.  Without their work, the sad reality is that the movie is otherwise just another movie that would fit so well on Lifetime and Lifetime Movie Network's daily lineup.  The movie's pacing hurts its presentation even more.  That is because it drags throughout the movie, not just at points.  Luckily its negative impact is not enough to make the movie a complete failure.  The background information shared in the DVD's packaging helps establish at least some more appreciation for the movie.  Together with the serious nature of the movie's story and the cast's work, that information gives audiences just enough to make the movie worth seeing at least once.  Rose Plays Julie is available now on DVD through Film Movement.

/m/rose_plays_julie	c761f885-5054-35a8-af02-12efcd96b5e5	0.5	Plodding pace with an unlikable protagonist makes for a film that's barely watchable. Rose has no personality and from what little we're shown, she's thoroughly unpleasant which translates into a "who cares" scenario.  She, like Promising Young Woman, cant connect the character with human traits we can relate to, thus we just don't care, can't root for her or hope for  her. I endured to the end but with maybe 10 minutes left said to myself; "Life is too short to waste on bad movies." Click.
/m/rose_plays_julie	c761f885-5054-35a8-af02-12efcd96b5e5	2	Disappointing on all fronts, plot, characters, mood, believability. All just vaguely depressing.
/m/rose_plays_julie	c761f885-5054-35a8-af02-12efcd96b5e5	1	I watched my daughters bedroom paint dry earlier today. Turns out, that was too exciting, so I saw this movie.
/m/my_heart_cant_beat_unless_you_tell_it_to	b8b31f3a-6b99-4ef6-81bb-331d6e80bb22	1	Big waste of time and blood.
/m/my_heart_cant_beat_unless_you_tell_it_to	b8b31f3a-6b99-4ef6-81bb-331d6e80bb22	0.5	absolutely atrocious. the build up was NOT worth for the ending to be such a let down. no suspense, no scary nor did this movie need any cognitive skills to watch it. unbelievably boring.
/m/my_heart_cant_beat_unless_you_tell_it_to	b8b31f3a-6b99-4ef6-81bb-331d6e80bb22	5	Minor spoilers !! First off, the movie looks visually pleasing, the cinematography is just splendid. I did not know what it is going to be about, my subconscious assumed it's going to be your typical horror flick, but gladly it was much more than that and I enjoyed every second of it. Its a slow burn and its about this kid(teenager) who happens to be a vampire. Being a vampire, is actually portrayed as a sickness here. He needs blood and cannot go outside during the day. The whole movie follows his brother and sister struggling to arrange bodies for him on blood of which he can feast upon.  For a vampire flick, this is a really mature film. Its about how far one can go who for their family. The sickness is actually a metaphor for a real life terminal illness where the patient and his family, both suffer. The patient dies day by day, but there's not much you can do except be there for them.  At the end of the movie, the kid demands to be killed, almost similar to the mercy-kill that happens in real life. Besides treating the audience as intelligent, the movie pleases us with really tensed sequences.
/m/my_heart_cant_beat_unless_you_tell_it_to	b8b31f3a-6b99-4ef6-81bb-331d6e80bb22	3.5	It is an interesting movie, not really horror movie, but filled with monsters.
/m/my_heart_cant_beat_unless_you_tell_it_to	b8b31f3a-6b99-4ef6-81bb-331d6e80bb22	4	Slow and creepy, very thankful the film didn't feel the need to explain itself because I felt like that raised the scariness levels. I wasn't really sure of what was happening, in a good way, so much mystery.  Although for such a slow film it did a great job at keeping me at the edge of my seat.
/m/my_heart_cant_beat_unless_you_tell_it_to	b8b31f3a-6b99-4ef6-81bb-331d6e80bb22	1	I know I'm going to be called a pleb for not liking this movie, but it's just not good. There are some good performances, but the script relies on you not wanting to be called a pleb. I mean, it's a slow burn, which isn't normally a problem, but there's not pay off. The acting is good, but there's no real character development or outstanding arch to make it worth watching. It's an indie film that offers you nothing more than being able to say you like it and call anyone who doesn't a pleb. I keep coming back to that because it's the only reason I can see to justify it's RT Critic's Score. I was a big defender of "Only Lovers Left Alive" because it was an original take on the vampire film genre. Well, the problem with this movie is it's basically the same take, but without any reason to like it. I could see watching this movie as a high mark on the resume of anyone involved, but I can't see watching it as a lover of film. It's not original, there's no reward for slogging through it, and in the end it there's nothing to it that you can really credit it with that makes it worth watching.
/m/my_heart_cant_beat_unless_you_tell_it_to	b8b31f3a-6b99-4ef6-81bb-331d6e80bb22	5	Beautifully acted, but less of a horror film and more of a drama with a lot of gore.
/m/my_heart_cant_beat_unless_you_tell_it_to	b8b31f3a-6b99-4ef6-81bb-331d6e80bb22	1.5	Boring and lacking in all areas.
/m/my_heart_cant_beat_unless_you_tell_it_to	b8b31f3a-6b99-4ef6-81bb-331d6e80bb22	3.5	It's bleak, moody, evocative and I loved it. I love movies like this that don't need much dialogue to convey the message. However, it leaves too many questions unanswered. Why was he a vampire? Why aren't his siblings vampires? How can they just be killing people off and not create any suspicion? Why did the brother react in such a stupid way when he found the young guy in the house?
/m/my_heart_cant_beat_unless_you_tell_it_to	b8b31f3a-6b99-4ef6-81bb-331d6e80bb22	4	Grossly entertaining and Painfully educating !! You are doomed when you can't give up. Movie's tone of visual sets our mind on the grief collected by each individual sibling to their existence. The indefiniteness of three siblings is skillfully portrayed by the cast. I think story represent much common and painful dilemma. I think the blood thirst of Thomas represent a problematic addiction and how it eventually devour their already sad and hardly surviving family.  Jessie represt the motherly figure who don't stop at nothing to provide and keep the fam together also the one who sacrificed all herself in her mission. Dwight is the one who is shoved the man of the house responsibility upon himself who is living in-between the reality and fantasy. Thomas tbeingnthe needy and fragile. And tragically as inevitable it is the fragile and worn-out meet the destined ends creating the way out for the dreamer and wayfarer. Afterall sticking to the mid avenue is the way.
/m/stalker_2021	f168f030-6037-36ed-a685-8dfc5f477834	2	Difficult to review without spoilers so I'll do my best. The film's plot is extremely similar to a movie called Derailed with Jennifer Aniston. The villain is a borderline omniscient Mary Sue character that makes no mistakes, has no emotions, and whose motivations exist only to facilitate the plot of a movie. None of the characters behave in a way actual people would in these circumstances, and every scene seems utterly false as a result. Every character behaves exactly as the villain wants and expects them to, making the film feel like a deranged power fantasy of its writer.
/m/stalker_2021	f168f030-6037-36ed-a685-8dfc5f477834	3.5	Andy (played by Vincent Van Horn)  moves to LA after a romantic breakup and following a bar room encounter with Sam (played by Christine Ko) takes a drive home  by an Uber style driver. Roger (played by Michael Lee Joplin), the driver then encounters Andy the following day and strike up a friendship, which we the audience know wont end well for one of them as Roger gives off the ‘creepy' vibe straight from the off.  Andy does the polite thing and totally ignores the creepy angle  and agrees to meet Roger to further their friendship (big  mistake isnt it!!)   One of the many things I love about Stalker is that it doesn't hide the creepiness of Roger and the film is better for that option. It reminds us that there are creepy people out there and we aren't always shocked when they turn out to be a little unhinged.  When Andy's blossoming connection with Sam continues, Roger pretty quickly turns somewhat jealous, and obsessive and sends text after text to Andy, and doesn't like that Andy's attention is elsewhere. But it goes beyond text, and some scenes showing how Roger uses modern technology to enter someones lies, ir a little jarring and will make you think about the security in your own life.   I love these sort of films, and whilst Stalker isn't a subtle hidden meaning type of movie, it doesn't need to be, and Stalker is all the better for that. the film is a tight, perfectly paced thriller with the great leads in the cast (especially Christine Ko) , and the filmmakers make great use of the LA landscape. Quick side note, the film used to go under the title of ‘Blinders'   I highly recommend the film if you want to put your feet up, and escape into a psychological for 90 mins.
/m/stalker_2021	f168f030-6037-36ed-a685-8dfc5f477834	3	This movie was alright. Pretty twisted! 7/10 hated the ending tbh
/m/stalker_2021	f168f030-6037-36ed-a685-8dfc5f477834	4.5	This is creepy AF. I loved it. Really makes you think twice about people. You just never really know who someone really is. Great acting, dialogue, story.
/m/stalker_2021	f168f030-6037-36ed-a685-8dfc5f477834	4.5	A thriller and a horror! Won’t go into the horror part, but it is not throughout and not very bloody. But the thriller part grabbed me for sure. The actors and the writing pull you in. Loved the guy from Austin. And his dog. Scared of the driver guy. Well-written and directed, never a dull moment!
/m/stalker_2021	f168f030-6037-36ed-a685-8dfc5f477834	3.5	A tad bit WAY too sadistic for me, though I appreciate the small nuggets of comedy sprinkled throughout.
/m/the_man_who_sold_his_skin	60db03e1-acfc-32c7-8452-108c73f8f2a2	4.5	One of the best movies of the last few years.
/m/the_man_who_sold_his_skin	60db03e1-acfc-32c7-8452-108c73f8f2a2	3	Never uninteresting, but not deep, this film missed a great chance to pick a lane and instead took the middle of the road.  The narrative either has to be the struggle for the girl, or the law angle which develops.  Melding that and the artist's sudden change of mood and it's hard to wonder what this could have been.  Layered with fine performances it's generally polite to look at except for one out of place scene.  Take it or leave it for sure!  6/10
/m/the_man_who_sold_his_skin	60db03e1-acfc-32c7-8452-108c73f8f2a2	4	How to tell a story that deals with a work of art that uses the skin of a human being as a canvas? Well director Kaouther Ben Hania found a formula to tell this story that sounds quite bizarre at first if it wasn't partially based on the real story of the Belgian artist Wim Delvoye who did it. In the script for this film as well as to add to the dramatic value of the story we meet two lovers in Syria in 2011 - just before the war. Raqqa Sam Ali (played by the excellent Yahya Mahayni) and his fiancée Abeer (the beautiful actress Dea Lianne) who are madly in love until an incident separates them forcing Sam Ali to flee to Lebanon in order to escape prison in Syria. Time passes and Sam Ali begins to adapt to life in Beirut but keeping in touch with Abeer, who is favored by his family and the political situation in Syria getting worse, marries a man with a lot of money who takes her to Brussels, Belgium. Poor and without much hope of finding his love again Sam Ali attends some clandestine art events in Beirut because as a refugee he cannot be identified with the penalty of being deported. And in an artist presentation he meets two people who will completely change his life the internationally known artist Jeffrey Godefroi (the equally excellent Koen De Bouw) and Soraya Waldy (Monica Bellucci in an interesting appearance) as an art dealer. In this meeting, Jeff proposes to Sam Ali that he is able to free him from the limits imposed by the refugee situation in which he lives with wide freedoms and can even travel to Belgium and meet his lover Abeer. The price will be a contract in which Sam Ali grants his back being tattooed with a work of art by Jeffrey as well as being available to him when necessary to display it in the art gallery. Reluctant Sam Ali eventually accepts and that life-changing choice is what the movie is about. With some amazing and provocative scenes we discreetly experience the sensation that the director manages to subtly place us inside Sam Ali's life. I don't recall feeling such an effect in recent times with such delicacy that we clearly understand the benefits Sam Ali comes to experience as well as his deepest afflictions. This is all without ever falling into the obvious or empty. In one of the many interesting scenes in this movie is an auction of artwork at which Sam Ali is eventually sold. The intensity and temperature raise so much at this particular moment that if you're not enjoying this movie too much you'll change your mind on this mesmerizing scene. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best International Feature Film 2020. This film surprised me because everything I expected didn't happen and it was positively surprising and I congratulate director Ben Hania for exceeding my expectations. Well done.
/m/the_man_who_sold_his_skin	60db03e1-acfc-32c7-8452-108c73f8f2a2	4.5	Great narrative, strong acts, smart cinematography and good music selection.
/m/the_man_who_sold_his_skin	60db03e1-acfc-32c7-8452-108c73f8f2a2	4	Despite its weaknesses, it still carries its weight as an art film
/m/the_man_who_sold_his_skin	60db03e1-acfc-32c7-8452-108c73f8f2a2	3.5	As the reviewers have written this movie is collaboration of money and art.  However the art is a tattoo on the back of a Syrian refugee.  As serious as the subject of abused refugees is there are some very human and some very funny aspect of a living man whose back becomes an exhibited work of art and is even sold to a collector and then auctioned! In all this story is a love story and seems to never find happiness.
/m/the_man_who_sold_his_skin	60db03e1-acfc-32c7-8452-108c73f8f2a2	3.5	The Man Who Sold His Skin is a film that had a great premise, but not a particularly good execution. In ideas and themes, it's very strong. The central acting performance is excellent as is the film's cinematography. But the second half dragged, it became rather repetitious and ultimately it would have been much better as a short rather than a feature movie.
/m/the_man_who_sold_his_skin	60db03e1-acfc-32c7-8452-108c73f8f2a2	4	This film, which was Syria's entry to the Oscars and made the shortlist, centers on Sam Ali, a refugee who agrees to have his back tattooed as a form of art in exchange for money, freedom, and a visa to Europe, where his girlfriend is betrothed to a member of the embassy. While uneven in its execution, the film works best as a commentary (and perhaps even satire) on the question of art and its commodification (as well as the commodification of Sam). Sam exchanges his back for his freedom, but he comes to realize that he is trapped in a different kind of hell. It is one of those films that I enjoy, one that stimulates thinking and challenges convention. The cinematography is beautifully done and is itself, in many places, a work of art. I also really liked the score. Thumbs up for a thought-provoking film that is well-acted and kept me engaged. I liked this one as well as some of the others on the Best International Feature list.
/m/the_man_who_sold_his_skin	60db03e1-acfc-32c7-8452-108c73f8f2a2	3.5	It is beautiful, images and a perfect aesthetic, but the script is tiring because little explored the real reality that the character should face, but it is a good film.
/m/the_man_who_sold_his_skin	60db03e1-acfc-32c7-8452-108c73f8f2a2	3	Oscar nominated foreign film about a Syrian refugee (can't go one Oscar season without at least one film touching on the Syrian conflict) who winds up selling his skin to an art project in Europe.. deals with the issues of artistic expression and exploitation of refugees as well as a rather unbelievable love story. While the film has interesting ideas the ending is a bit too pat and unbelievable and the film itself isn't quite up there with the other contenders.
/m/meander	fd285a4b-fd5c-3c77-98e0-212c2b2d8681	5	My new favorite movie. I want a number 2.
/m/meander	fd285a4b-fd5c-3c77-98e0-212c2b2d8681	2	This movie reminds me of Cube from 1997. Not a film a liked to watch to the end. Maybe I got it wrong, I just saw the high ratings.
/m/meander	fd285a4b-fd5c-3c77-98e0-212c2b2d8681	3	The suspense in this film is quite effective. What isn’t effective is the sudden shift of plot the last 10 minutes of the film.
/m/meander	fd285a4b-fd5c-3c77-98e0-212c2b2d8681	3	Crawl and crawl and crawl  A new French sci-fi mystery where a woman is caught in a series of tunnel with multiple traps.  The movie started out slow, and this really requires some patience before things started to pick up. Honestly, the traps were not too scary like in similar movies. Then, when the twist started, it wasn't too surprising because this was done countless times before. The development of the main character was again, pretty typical, and was supposed to tie to the story. However, it really didn't make a lot of sense and felt cheesy.   There were still things that worked in the movie. Even though the progression was slow, there were still intense scenes that kept me on the edge. The clean camera work and some gores elevated the horror aspect and helped with the scenes.  Overall, it's a mystery that is done better before. 5.5/10
/m/meander	fd285a4b-fd5c-3c77-98e0-212c2b2d8681	2.5	Strange mix of torture porn and otherworldly, symbolic, alien, whatever. It comes out pretty well at the end, not bad, but the mix is incongruous at best.
/m/meander	fd285a4b-fd5c-3c77-98e0-212c2b2d8681	2	French cinema's greatest strength lies in its success to always disappoint. You'll get to the end and ask, "what was the point of all this?"
/m/meander	fd285a4b-fd5c-3c77-98e0-212c2b2d8681	3.5	Half saw. Half cube. Half pig. Did I mention she climbs through a few loose sphincters  during her voyage?
/m/meander	fd285a4b-fd5c-3c77-98e0-212c2b2d8681	2	Even putting aside the rickety tinfoil sets, this isn't a great film. There is some tension in a few scenes but by and large it's poorly paced, underexplained and has very little in the way of payoff or character development.
/m/meander	fd285a4b-fd5c-3c77-98e0-212c2b2d8681	0.5	Very boring and slow. Makes no sense.Theres no explanation for what happens or why, the ending leaves it up to you for interpretation.  I can't believe people are giving this movie more than 3 stars.
/m/meander	fd285a4b-fd5c-3c77-98e0-212c2b2d8681	2	The movie has a very fun concept that is held back by one thing: the acting.  Just because there isn't much talking in this film, they decided to replace it with constant (!) moaning, panting and whining.  Otherwise it's a nice experience that has clearly drawn inspiration from the Cube movies.
/m/silent_night_2021	ab4abd05-de92-49a8-a313-3e11dd971d32	1	Right from the start I had difficulty hearing the distant dialogue over the loud score. I'm guessing writer, producer and director Will Thorne has never heard of boom mics. Then we have the casting of Bradley Taylor as Mark, who was monotonic, straight-faced, stale and boring, especially compared to his side-kick. I felt he didn't want to even be there. I'm sure part blame goes to Thorne for failure to direct his cast properly. Then we have the slower than a snail-paced 93 min runtime that felt like 3 hours. The story was bland, boring and nothing new - at all, except for the "sidekick" (without giving away any spoilers), of which was ridiculous to begin with. Don't get me started on the plot and technical issues. This film might have been bearable if it was a 15-20 min short, with better directing.

/m/first_date_2021	035db5f2-412d-4e8d-b44d-c955d7a75bb9	1	Plot was terrible and not enough action for me!
/m/first_date_2021	035db5f2-412d-4e8d-b44d-c955d7a75bb9	5	Manuel Crosby is a creative warrior. I loved this film. It's not for everybody but its the type of movie that becomes a cult classic with movie fans because it breaks all the rules. There are alot of tonal shifts in the movie that give it a manic feel to it that I found very entertaining. I loved the two leads. The rest of the cast did a amazing job in the antagonist role. Some classic scenes and dialogue in this movie. This movie goes from some very sweet teen romance scenes to full blown cocaine cowboys in a drop of a hat.  It's wild, manic and very entertaining. You have been warned.
/m/first_date_2021	035db5f2-412d-4e8d-b44d-c955d7a75bb9	5	I loved this movie, it was a funny, suspenseful, action packed movie. This movie obviously didn't have the money it should've but it did amazing with the tools it was given
/m/first_date_2021	035db5f2-412d-4e8d-b44d-c955d7a75bb9	5	First Date is one of the best Comedy Caper films I've seen in a long time! The characters are diverse and Interesting and the dialogue and action sequences are definitely compatible with some of the best films out there that are made on a much bigger budget! Definitely a must-see!
/m/first_date_2021	035db5f2-412d-4e8d-b44d-c955d7a75bb9	5	Fun movie and great cast. Perfect Friday night movie at home.
/m/first_date_2021	035db5f2-412d-4e8d-b44d-c955d7a75bb9	2.5	First Date is an ambitious but ultimately flawed film. I really liked what the film was trying to do. I liked the vibe it was going for, where everything gets crazier and crazier as the film went on. Unfortunately, I wasn’t too crazy for the execution. The film’s low budget is very evident, with some distractingly poor shots. I liked the lead and the romantic interest, but the other acting is pretty inconsistent. The tone is all over the place, but the screenplay has some good dialogue. Overall, I liked what the film was going for more than the film itself. You can definitely see some talent from the filmmaking team, even if it doesn’t pan out here. I’m curious to see what writers/directors Manual Crosby and Darren Knapp do next.
/m/censor_2021	c179934f-803d-4117-9a12-cc75c4da4163	2	Started off interestingly with an intriguing central character, then went really silly.
/m/censor_2021	c179934f-803d-4117-9a12-cc75c4da4163	2	Censor. Hmm. Where to start. Well. It's a well made movie, nice visuals, strong acting as to be expected from our protagonist who is a very talented up and coming force. However, the press have gone feverishly OTT for this one as typically found in many of the UK movies who are backed by Film4 or BBC or any other UK movie body. The problem unravels when watching this movie that you realise very quickly it is an emperors clothes scenario. It really isn't what it has been made out to be. It's average. Bordering on mediocre. So much so I almost fell asleep. Which for me is not the norm. Yes it has a great actress but the story is an empty vessel. The execution is weak. If you dig a little you'll see Kim Newman is an exec. Kim Newman is a film critic! Dig further Kermode interviewed the director and attended set during production before his startling five star recommendation. The movie business is as we all know one of the darker businesses and sadly this movie capitalised on every trick way from actually writing a decent story to attempt to assure its success. Which is why the movie has flopped. Big time.
/m/censor_2021	c179934f-803d-4117-9a12-cc75c4da4163	4.5	Niamh Algar is the electrifying centerpiece of this original, very creepy film. There are more than a few things to unpack here, but it's well worth it; it's a creepfest on many levels, not the least of which is personal loss, guilt, and grief, which all touch home like a hatchet to the heart. There is real emotion in the madness. There is also ridiculous irony and a few really good laughs. This film has it all.
/m/censor_2021	c179934f-803d-4117-9a12-cc75c4da4163	3.5	Surreal but not to the point of incoherence or a heavily muddied storyline. Remarkably, this intense and eye-popping piece of heady cinema is also the debut of a new filmmaker unaccompanied by a large budget.
/m/censor_2021	c179934f-803d-4117-9a12-cc75c4da4163	2	Wanted to like this more (love the idea of a horror movie about a horror movie censor) but it is ultimately too muddled, trapped somewhere between a homage and an arthouse deconstruction.
/m/censor_2021	c179934f-803d-4117-9a12-cc75c4da4163	0.5	Terrible compared to American videos  Not worth the $9 and a wasted date night Honestly leave it on the shelf, buy any other movie. (Boring and convoluted, kinda waste of time)
/m/censor_2021	c179934f-803d-4117-9a12-cc75c4da4163	5	Astounding originality with intriguing choices in every cut.  Welsh director Prano Bailey-Bond's indie psychological horror mystery Censor (2021) entertained me with fascinating direction in every scene. Bailey-Bond's direction features a haunting atmosphere of neon glowing England in the 1980's with shockingly violent and gory footage from old banned horror films in England called Video Nasty. This was a real phenomenon of grotesquely bloody and vicious horror movies that Bailey-Bond recreates England's general public outrage over the overly absurd horror movies of the time. I found Censor to be riveting and not scary in a jump scare startling me kind of way, but rather stressful and unnerving as tension builds, suspense tightens, and your mind wanders to what horrors may come.  Irish actress Niamh Algar is spectacularly engaging as the lead actress of Censor in her portrayal of a slowly unraveling censor of horror films named Enid Baines. Algar brings a serious gravitas, natural charisma, gentle presence, and haunting aura to Censor. Her haunted looks are breathtakingly beautiful, while her hurt eyes bear the unbearable weight of trauma, loss, and guilt. Her every movement and dialogue feels touched by an unspeakable terror she cannot handle. Algar is so refined and subtle with her words, body language, and glances that speak volumes to how uncomfortable, uncertain, and upset her character Enid feels. I hope that Censor is the breakout star making role for Niamh Algar. She's simply superbly nuanced and enchanting as Enid in Censor.  Irish actor Michael Smiley is excellent as the scumbag producer pervert Doug Smart. He's a fantastic allusion to Harvey Weinstein and other abusive creeps in the movie industry with his taking of every woman's glance and presence as an opportunity for his unwanted advances. Talk about an unsettling and disturbing performance. Sophia La Porta is gorgeous as the redhead actress Alice Lee in the trashy horror flicks within Video Nasty's domain. Her frightening looks and screams are the stuff of Scream Queen legend. Adrien Schiller's creepy director performance as Frederick North is so oddly commanding as he controls the power dynamic of the finale film shoot sequence.  Prano Bailey-Bond and Anthony Fletcher's writing is wonderful as they blend social commentary of critiquing the mania over these movies, satirizing Margaret Thatcher's iron fisted conservatism, with a sympathetic dive into psychological guilt over past trauma. Bailey-Bond brings a feminist lens towards sexism and harrassment in the workplace as nearly all the men in her censorship office find the main character Nina prudish, attractive, and hit on her. Her feminine perspective on how sleazy male producers can be to the sexual violence towards women by male horror directors is biting commentary on the film industry.  Prano Bailey-Bond is certainly a director to watch out for after her delightful strange and thought-provoking arthouse horror picture Censor! Her direction has these brilliant choices like the raw, fuzzy horror film footage cutting hard to the crystal clear modern film imagery for startling visual contrast for the audience. I really appreciated how much she clearly loves inventive filmmaking. I'm stunned by her innovative choice to have the old square aspect ratio of the black bars all around the screen for the horror pictures from the 80's to the striking widescreen aspect ratio for the contemporary scenes. Her direction for the finale that blends the film set reality with repressed memories of the past blending together by virtue of the screen closing in on the actress is quite genius, honestly. I've never seen anything like Censor.  Mark Towns' editing is pretty cool and stylish. I cannot imagine how difficult it was to splice together montages of all the bloody bits of Video Nasties with old fuzzy filters and color correction. Censor is a brisk and delightful 84 minutes that flies by like nothing. Annika Summerson's cinematography is gorgeous with all these breathtaking close-up and medium shots focused on Niamh Algar to constantly show her strained mental state. The wide shots are neat, especially as things shift from still or slowly panning shots to handheld video footage. Censor features so many vividly imaginative shots, perspectives, and framing that you cannot look away from the impending horror.  Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch's score is composed to sound like pounding 1980's synths that are so in vogue again now. I loved the music in Censor and would happily hear more synth heavy horror scores from Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch. Saffron Cullane's costume designs look like 80's trench coats and dark suits with an authentic aesthetic. Ruth Pease and Rebecca Powell's make-up is excellent as you believe people appear natural in the movie's reality, while the movie segments look like film make-up artistry. All of Paulina Rzeszowska's seedy looking production design, Philip A. Brown's ethereal art direction, and Bronwyn Franklin's dingy set decorations create a dreary atmosphere for Censor. I appreciate István V. Molnár, Danielle Dunster, and Mark Epstein's grisly, low budget visual effects for the horror segments in Censor.  In my opinion, Censor is easily the best horror film from 2021 as it's impeccably made for such a small budgeted movie, creatively directed, and provides a riveting performance from the lead actress Niamh Algar. I hope Censor grips you!
/m/censor_2021	c179934f-803d-4117-9a12-cc75c4da4163	3.5	Slow at first. It has a hefty style. A couple of “oh damn” moments gave it the extra half star. I bet I’ll like it more when I watch it again in a few years.
/m/censor_2021	c179934f-803d-4117-9a12-cc75c4da4163	3.5	After years of retro-influenced horrors trying to emulate the giallo aesthetic, Censor is a welcome addition to the genre. Prano Bailey-Bond's directorial debut is a stylish, thought-provoking homage to the exploitation flicks of the '80s. Whereas Niamh Algar delivers an incredible performance that aptly captures the psychological turmoil of her character. Similar to other social horror critiques produced by the BFI including In Fabric (2018) and His House (2020), Censor will likely be divisive amongst fans of the genre. Its methodical pacing moves along with a dark psychological pulse, slowly building towards a bloody climax that blurs the line between reality. However, it stylishly captures the historical paranoia caused by exploitation cinema and the relationship between art and real life. In many ways, the historical context mirrors contemporary cancel culture and should urge others to revisit several genre classics.
/m/censor_2021	c179934f-803d-4117-9a12-cc75c4da4163	4	In the 1980s, British film-censor Enid starts to lose her grip on reality, as she watches a film that reminds her of the disappearance of her sister. Very well acted and eery.
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_one	8856446c-957e-39c4-9a7e-2122cfaa18d2	4	Pretty awesome adaptation of a truly great Batman story. Some of the villains feel a little shoehorned in, but I don't care, this is the kind of fan service I can get behind. I wish this could get a love action adaptation of the same quality.
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_one	8856446c-957e-39c4-9a7e-2122cfaa18d2	1.5	Spoiler Alert. You can't make the main villain a 200 lbs man whenever he's wearing a mask, one capable overpowering Batman, and then "big reveal" him to be an 80 lbs woman with no combat training, and not turn the whole thing into a farce.  Also the reason for her taking revenge seemed too over the top. The Roman would have just forced a marriage before the baby was born. The whole story is dumb.  And the Rogue's gallery seemed shoehorned in.  The one thing I liked about it was Catwoman. It made me very sad to hear Naya Rivera passed, I would have liked to watch many Catwoman features starring her.
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_one	8856446c-957e-39c4-9a7e-2122cfaa18d2	5	Excelente nivel de esta película, incluso superior a las de dc en general que ya de por si son muy buenas. Y no es solo por la historia que te atrapa sino que el estilo de animación y la ambientación general se lucen.
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_one	8856446c-957e-39c4-9a7e-2122cfaa18d2	4.5	I've heard from people who've reviewed the films and read the books that Batman: The Long Halloween is one of the best Batman stories ever told. That it's up there with The Dark Knight Returns, A Death in the Family, and The Killing Joke. Two of those three adaptations were developed into magnificent movies in the DC animated movie slate that began back in 2007. Three films in total because one was a two part story just like this edition was. I was intrigued by the trailers for this movie and knowing it's a story that made Batman "the world's greatest detective" Having not read the book, I went into the film with the basic knowledge that it's another Batman animated flick. For the most part, these animated films from DC have been smash hits. Some of them have been top tier in DC films as a whole, the majority are good, and a select few are rather bad. With the consistent track record and usual great reviews, I went into this film and part 2 very excited. I could've watched them each when they came out but on top of being busy with life, I decided to watch them both back to back and I'm glad I did. I'm not going to dive into spoilers because this is a great movie with an excellent murder mystery and I think people should go into it blind like I did.  Right off the bat what I love about this film and part 2 is the animation and how thick it's all drawn. I don't know how, but it just feels like there's more details put into the character designs and it makes them all stand on their own. These are all low budget straight to Blu-Ray/Digital films and not all of them are up to par with animation. Some are better looking than others and this is easily some of the best animation that has been featured in these films. So The Long Halloween is centered around a mysterious killer who commits several murders over the course of Holiday's year round. They use an untraceable weapon, leave behind little clues, and strike fast and efficient. Another thing is all of the victims are in the Falcone and Maroni families, who are two rival gang families. It becomes a consistent basis, that a member or multiple are murdered on a holiday with the weapon left behind at the scene, alone with a decoration of the holiday that it's on. For instance on a Thanksgiving day murder, there's the weapon and a turkey leg left next to the victims. A young Batman teams up with Commissioner Gordon and District Attorney (DA) Harvey Dent to try and solve the murders. After Batman and Catwoman discover a warehouse containing the Falcone family fortune stuffed away, Harvey Dent burns it down and in retaliation, his home is bombed by an unknown assailant. Batman chases the suspect down, and after failing to get sufficient evidence that links the man to the bombing, he and Gordon let the man go. Gordon mentions to Batman, "You need to learn more about being a detective." That line will prove to be important later. This film's narrative does what any good murder mystery would do and plays with out expectations as to who the killer could be. We even get a few shots of the killers' eyes in some of the murder scenes, so you end up paying attention to certain characters eyes as the film goes on to see if there's a similarity to it. Which is a good way to distract your audience and keep details hidden from them, with their focus being on something else. One character is heavily hinted as being the killer, and through one brief flashback after a certain word is said, Batman assumes it to be this person. There are definitely things that could back this character up to be the killer, but when the moment comes and they're confronted by Batman, we find out so much more. On top of that, when the story takes an upside down turn, we see Batman's first failure as a detective. The ending itself was very shocking and will prove to be even more shocking when other details are revealed in part 2. I absolutely loved the way the film ended and there was even an important credit scene which tied right into the beginning of part 2.  As for issues, I think my only real issue was the fact that this movie moved around very fast between holidays. Like a murder would happen and there might be an action scene with other Batman villains, then the next scene begins and you can either tell the environment is different or someone will mention the holiday. Christmas and New Years were obvious because of snow and big crowds, but when it came to be Thanksgiving time, it would literally be playing out like a normal scene and then someone would mention that it's Thanksgiving. What was so weird about this way of editing was that it would happen right after an impactful scene, then the big time jump takes away the significance of it. Like I'm glad they didn't do anything like fading the camera out then back in over and over because they would get repetitive. It just came off as rushed for me.  Beyond that, this was an absolutely solid movie and a great first part to the story. One of my biggest problems with two part stories is they often don't stand on their own as a movie, and purely as set up. This movie did it all right and stood on its own as a great movie, while having a shocking ending to show the audience there is more to happen. Also the important credit scene gave us all the setup we as an audience needed because if I didn't watch it, then I sure as hell would've been very confused at the beginning of part 2. Seek this one out on Blu-Ray or streaming where it's available because I absolutely loved the film and thought it's one of the best movies of the year and one of DC animations best. I'm going to give Batman: The Long Halloween Part One, an A
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_one	8856446c-957e-39c4-9a7e-2122cfaa18d2	3.5	A strong detective story with plenty of atmosphere, but little depth beyond this. The Long Halloween is not slavish to the comic it adapts but captures the feel of the source material, if not quite matching its tension. Tim Sale's unique style sadly isn't replicated but there are some beautiful backgrounds and the characters emotions are clearly intelligible. The first film of DC's previous two-part adaptation, The Dark Knight Returns: Part 1, worked as a stand-alone due to the episodic nature of the comic, the same cannot be said for The Long Halloween, its whodunnit story makes this film incomplete and hard to judge on its own. It does choose a good place to end but frustratingly puts a key piece of set-up of the second part in a mid-credits scene, make sure you stick around for it.
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_one	8856446c-957e-39c4-9a7e-2122cfaa18d2	5	This is one of the best movies ever it has action suspense and a good reveal of the killer it does what killing joke doesn't it adapts a graphic novel well.
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_one	8856446c-957e-39c4-9a7e-2122cfaa18d2	0.5	Bad everything. Animation, acting, writing, directing. Everything. Just awful. And that's just the first 5 minutes.
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_one	8856446c-957e-39c4-9a7e-2122cfaa18d2	4	Traços ruins e gráficos dessa nova geração não me agradam ainda, mas a história além de apresentar um batman despreparado para todas as situações, tem uma história que te prende e deixa na curiosidade de quem é o "Feriado/Holiday"
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_one	8856446c-957e-39c4-9a7e-2122cfaa18d2	5	A must see for anyone who is a fan of the character or the og comic book.
/m/batman_the_long_halloween_part_one	8856446c-957e-39c4-9a7e-2122cfaa18d2	4	The Caped Crusader in another one of his many animated entries  Warner Bros. Animation adapts the comic storyline Gotham has fallen into ruin This story has Batman/Bruce Wayne track down a killer targeting his victims on Halloween night  James Gordon and district attorney Harvey Dent aid in the investigation  Carmine Falcone might be tied to the murder  Other villains like Joker, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, Mad Hatter, Scarecrow, and Solomon Grundy might have a connection to Batman's suspicions  As each holiday passes the mystery to the killings keeps deepening and Batman asks Calendar Man for his insight  Wayne never imagined the Batman would have to be a good detective yet the world will need what Batman needs to be as well as himself  A good first chapter to this two-parter with solid animation, superb voice acting, exciting action, and a good caper mystery  The animators really respect the source material and the artistic vision that goes along with it
/m/gaia_2021	32ef569c-962f-43e8-ad2b-c027c4a3f898	3.5	It was alright. The visuals are cool, the evil is a fresh villain, and story-wise it stays pretty interesting. However it does drag at times, and the conclusion is a bit telegraphed.
/m/gaia_2021	32ef569c-962f-43e8-ad2b-c027c4a3f898	0.5	The idea  was good but the final product  was a disaster
/m/gaia_2021	32ef569c-962f-43e8-ad2b-c027c4a3f898	0.5	Utter garbage. It tried WAYYY too hard to be "artsy", the characters behave in completely nonsensical ways (yes I realize it's a horror movie and that's what characters do in horror movies), and the bizarre choices of camera movements are more distracting than anything.  Why have the camera upside down? To indicate a character's disorientation? That's just lazy and film school 101.  I have no idea how so many professional critics found this movie enjoyable.
/m/gaia_2021	32ef569c-962f-43e8-ad2b-c027c4a3f898	3	Don't listen to the people who said the movie went slow, I have seen much slower.   Think the director lost it in the 2nd act with his vision tho.  Overall an original movie BUT they completely stole the artwork (clickers) from last of us game. Not sure if people worked on this movie worked on the game.
/m/gaia_2021	32ef569c-962f-43e8-ad2b-c027c4a3f898	2.5	The film has good visual ideas and attempts a decent go at the atmospherics, but personally it doesn't quite deliver. Maybe the director couldn't execute a vision that was planned, or maybe he didn't have the tools to do so. It tries to be in the same ball park as films like Without Name or They Remain, but instead comes off as an independent artsy type movie.
/m/gaia_2021	32ef569c-962f-43e8-ad2b-c027c4a3f898	2.5	It's a shame the movie is such a slow burn with a great part of the second act with not much happening thrilling enough because there is definitively an interresting premise and on original approach in what it is dealing with. Has some visually striking moments and ideas but falls short of making all this really engaging and effective.
/m/gaia_2021	32ef569c-962f-43e8-ad2b-c027c4a3f898	3	Another indie eco-horror released this year. A bit ago I watched In the Earth, and it was one of the worst and seizure-inducing movies this year. Gaia was a significantly better tho, in both visual effects and story.  As with most eco-horror, the experience was like taking mushroom and tripping the entire time. This movie was overloaded with creative and breathtaking visual effects. I was often enthralled, especially the long scene where the main character was in a long trip. The designs and looks of the creatures in the movie was also good, although the camera was a bit shaky and unclear when they appeared.   Story-wise, it wasn't anything new. The main theme was about nature claiming back its place. The movie was also a environmental commentary on human since the Industrial Evolution. Still, there was a pretty good twist to the story, and I enjoyed it at the end. However, the story didn't always come together logically. It felt like the movie focused too much on the visuals that the it pushed the borderline over to style-over-substance.   Overall, an okay horror despite great visuals. 6/10
/m/gaia_2021	32ef569c-962f-43e8-ad2b-c027c4a3f898	3.5	This was strange film and yes I played the last of us but still really strange film
/m/gaia_2021	32ef569c-962f-43e8-ad2b-c027c4a3f898	0.5	Anyone who likes this movie is a weirdo man. The story talks about a new virus living under the earth and this crazed scientist worships it with his young son. The scientist preys on this young kid and then the movie turns away from the entire plot just to focus on sex scenes with this predatory chick on this young innocent kid (this is the first girl he's ever seen). The biggest waste of time. So much potential turned rotten, more than all of the trees and all of the poor souls this disease infected. Zero stars if I could.
/m/gaia_2021	32ef569c-962f-43e8-ad2b-c027c4a3f898	2	the only thing good about "gaia" was its visual depiction of rotten corpses, engulfed and entangled with nature. the ONLY thing. oh right, and it stole the aesthetics of the fungi-creatures from "the last of us" - that's plagiarism right?
/m/long_story_short_2021	5b4343e6-1a76-4d52-8041-3b9f80f76bb6	3	Un argumento que podría haber dado para un poco más de narrativa, pero que acaba siendo entretenido. Comedia romántica con twist sci-fi palomerita.
/m/long_story_short_2021	5b4343e6-1a76-4d52-8041-3b9f80f76bb6	0.5	Its redeeming feature is representing how time in you life goes quickly but otherwise its a bit like watching a film in fast forward. Like the Guardian review says, its almost like the writer didn't have time to write the script properly. The film is basically the main character running around like a headless chicken whilst the other characters are confused.
/m/long_story_short_2021	5b4343e6-1a76-4d52-8041-3b9f80f76bb6	5	I loved every minute of this movie. Groundhog Day is one of my all time favourites so I loved that the premise of this film was based on the same concept that we should live life to the fullest, be the best version of ourselves every single day and never put off or procrastinate. It struck a chord with me. Superb casting, acting and characters. Just an all round sweet movie and I love Rafe Spall. YOLO !!!
/m/long_story_short_2021	5b4343e6-1a76-4d52-8041-3b9f80f76bb6	5	If Ground Hog Day was mixed up with a time machine, this is what you'd get.
/m/long_story_short_2021	5b4343e6-1a76-4d52-8041-3b9f80f76bb6	5	Saw this movie twice.  Second time was even better.  Awesome acting.  Movie with a good heart.
/m/long_story_short_2021	5b4343e6-1a76-4d52-8041-3b9f80f76bb6	3.5	Lawson's clever screenplay is anchored by winning turns from Rafe Spall and Zahra Newman and should satisfy most rom-com tragics - if only he'd handed over the directing reins to someone a little more adventurous. A touch of Michel Gondry type inventiveness wouldn't have gone astray.
/m/long_story_short_2021	5b4343e6-1a76-4d52-8041-3b9f80f76bb6	5	They say "Rom-Com are toxic". They are sometimes. But this one is the opposite and has an important message behind it. The message that we all know but don't care enough. This will remind you that. The characters chemistry is perfect and the actors are so good at their roles, Rate Spall, Zahra Newman and Ronny Chieng. This is such a beautiful, funny with emotional film. You won't regret it.
/m/long_story_short_2021	5b4343e6-1a76-4d52-8041-3b9f80f76bb6	5	Didn't expect to cry at this amazing movie, the small cast really made it memorable!
/m/long_story_short_2021	5b4343e6-1a76-4d52-8041-3b9f80f76bb6	4	An excellent little romantic comedy that plays around with time to make the important point that we shouldn't waste our lives focused on the things that don't matter most to us. Rafe Spall, who is onscreen 100% of the time, holds the whole movie together and keeps it moving with very witty dialogue mostly with his wife and best friend. It's a short movie that is paced well and remains engaging, despite getting a bit too obvious in its message at the end. A good date movie.
/m/long_story_short_2021	5b4343e6-1a76-4d52-8041-3b9f80f76bb6	5	Loved this movie.  Great to see an Australian comedy at the cinema.  Very well done.  Would highly recommend.
/m/werewolves_within	774d15b4-5735-4e00-868f-8b39ac2574f3	3	I had hoped to like this better.  It wound up being quite boring.  I'm glad I only paid a buck to see this on iTunes.
/m/werewolves_within	774d15b4-5735-4e00-868f-8b39ac2574f3	3.5	It's not a monster movie. You never really see the monster. Its more of a mystery/suspense comedy.  But it was good
/m/werewolves_within	774d15b4-5735-4e00-868f-8b39ac2574f3	1	I logged into rotten tomatoes for the first time ever just to warn viewers that this is a horrible movie.  First time in awhile I've been unable to finish a movie.  Not funny, also not scary.  Seems to be trying to make itself camp with the goal of attracting a cult following.  Judging by the other reviews, it may be succeeding.  But if you enjoy quality films, this is not one and you'd be better off just going to sleep (it may help with that - one good thing you can say).
/m/werewolves_within	774d15b4-5735-4e00-868f-8b39ac2574f3	1.5	Painful script, noisy characters. My brain is still bleeding.
/m/werewolves_within	774d15b4-5735-4e00-868f-8b39ac2574f3	2	O filme tem lacração e ideologia de gênero do começo ao fim. O protagonista até que manda bem , mas o resto fica difícil de engolir.
/m/werewolves_within	774d15b4-5735-4e00-868f-8b39ac2574f3	4.5	A sublimely silly, scary, witty and hilariously optimistic - this is a near perfect horror-comedy - that’s not only good because of a strong script, director and supporting cast, but the magnificently talented Sam Richardson.
/m/werewolves_within	774d15b4-5735-4e00-868f-8b39ac2574f3	3.5	Was overall a very decent film, however the ending left a lot to be desired. Should have been a character study on how people respond in a crisis
/m/werewolves_within	774d15b4-5735-4e00-868f-8b39ac2574f3	2.5	Looks like they had a blast filming, sets and editing and soundtrack are all on point, but the "plot," the script, the overacting are constant cringe, and not in a good way.
/m/werewolves_within	774d15b4-5735-4e00-868f-8b39ac2574f3	3.5	Werewolves Within is a smart, witty film that mostly entertains in its snappy running time. Based on a video game the film is a mixture of comedy and horror and succeeds mainly due to a vibrant cast and some witty dialogue. Finn is a Forest Ranger newly asigned to Beaverfield, a small town in rural New York. He comes to a town divided by a proposed pipeline. He is introduced to the residents of the town by the local postal worker. And the residents are a strange mixture indeed. But when a dog goes missing and the generators in the town are mutilated it leads to suspicion of a strange creature lurking in the town. A snowstorm then leads to most of them being snowed in in the local Inn. There paranoia runs wild with suspicion close behind. Eventually it leads to the idea of a werewolf running wild. The cast really makes this film, especially the super talented Sam Richardson. There are many funny moments as the tension ramps up. The only thing that holds the film back is that it is nether completely hilarious nor convincingly scary. But it's a fun film full of smart, fun moments.
/m/werewolves_within	774d15b4-5735-4e00-868f-8b39ac2574f3	0.5	Acting and writing are bad. It's chaotic, overly gimmicky and predictable. It borrows from many genres but fails in all the categories.
/m/spirit_untamed	62bbd28a-37b1-34ab-82a5-a22561b8f5b9	3.5	Well done and enjoyable movie for the family to watch about a spirited little girl and her love for horses following the loss of her mother. Can't wait for the sequel
/m/spirit_untamed	62bbd28a-37b1-34ab-82a5-a22561b8f5b9	0.5	It's an incredibly annoying and baffling bore that should never have made it to the big screen.
/m/spirit_untamed	62bbd28a-37b1-34ab-82a5-a22561b8f5b9	5	A good movie was ruined by reviews The production team should seek compensation from the reviewers  1. The work of Xiao Ma Wang has been correctly displayed in the TV series. I am very sure 2. The movie should have a different style to become a sequel (parallel universe) The classic secret of the first movie. In order not to be destroyed, one must have a different view of the parallel universe This must be a good movie. If you read the comments of the judges and miss this opportunity, you lose.
/m/spirit_untamed	62bbd28a-37b1-34ab-82a5-a22561b8f5b9	3.5	Me: Even if it's not completely on parr with Stalling of the south this movie still had some great sprite  My Fennekin ( Fenn ): obviously you have to watch the show to like it better but to us it stand up very well on its own My Piplup: especially when we really liked the show Me: We watched it together with my mother & is was great even with a predictable story & a few miss fires in the animation this movie still has great spirte with beautiful Animation  My Eevee ( Sofinea ): great voice acting  My Piplup: and a epic finale  My Fennekin ( Fenn ): obviously you need to watch the show to get invested in the movie but for a Netflix from dreamworks it's still solid on its We don't think everyone would think the same but it's at least harmless and still have some spirite from both worlds  My Pikachu: we're gonna give it a 7
/m/spirit_untamed	62bbd28a-37b1-34ab-82a5-a22561b8f5b9	5	I took my 6 year old granddaughter and she loved it.
/m/spirit_untamed	62bbd28a-37b1-34ab-82a5-a22561b8f5b9	5	Very cute and perfect for a young age
/m/spirit_untamed	62bbd28a-37b1-34ab-82a5-a22561b8f5b9	5	This version is much kid-friendlier than its original counterpart- the original was traumatizing for my daughter due to the scenes of horse abuse. Spirit Untamed is a family friendly film that will sweep its horse loving audiences away with good plot, good morals and a good paced storyline that is easy to follow for viewers of all ages without boring adults. Great job!!
/m/spirit_untamed	62bbd28a-37b1-34ab-82a5-a22561b8f5b9	1.5	WHAT THE HELL!? The original Spirit movie is such a masterpiece but this, this is a total flop.
/m/spirit_untamed	62bbd28a-37b1-34ab-82a5-a22561b8f5b9	3.5	My girls (ages 4 and 7) were absolutely gripped. Plot was a little thin and characters undeveloped. But this is good, positive storytelling simple enough for younger audiences to follow, and with decent enough animation to keep grown-ups entertained too. Would recommend.
/m/spirit_untamed	62bbd28a-37b1-34ab-82a5-a22561b8f5b9	5	We took our granddaughter and her friend for her 10th birthday.  Both girls ride horses, so they loved it and so did we.
/m/the_evil_next_door	21089513-a701-4f44-a2bc-2348c2e635d5	4	The majority of these reviews are far too critical of the movie. I liked that it didnt have an absurd amount of jump scares, and it didnt have cheesy effects that make me hate most scary movies. The plot line was pretty average as far as scary movies go.. stepmom tries to save her son from an imaginary evil in the house and the dad doesnt believe her/thinks she's crazy, but she wasnt. It was done well, and the acting was on point
/m/the_house_next_door_meet_the_blacks_2	223bd3c4-bebf-3b74-98e1-3cebb7ad8cca	5	that I can tell you pure humor the best you are going to see
/m/the_house_next_door_meet_the_blacks_2	223bd3c4-bebf-3b74-98e1-3cebb7ad8cca	5	I laughed the entire time,thought it was hilarious.
/m/the_house_next_door_meet_the_blacks_2	223bd3c4-bebf-3b74-98e1-3cebb7ad8cca	1	Bloated.....annoying ...... boring
/m/the_house_next_door_meet_the_blacks_2	223bd3c4-bebf-3b74-98e1-3cebb7ad8cca	0.5	Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever watched.
/m/the_house_next_door_meet_the_blacks_2	223bd3c4-bebf-3b74-98e1-3cebb7ad8cca	1.5	Should've stuck with the purge. This was such a fail imo and I think the director knew as well. The amount of thrown fan service at the end to distract the viewer from how bad the ending was is blatantly obvious. I understand that this is a "Scary Movie" type of film, but dang. The quality serverely dropped from the first, character dialogue going all over the place, scenes that mean nothing and had no humor what so ever, along with the fact that the special effects barely matched the actors, which is strange because these actors are actually talented. Rest in all the pepperoni and salami Meet the Blacks series, you were kinda okay.
/m/the_house_next_door_meet_the_blacks_2	223bd3c4-bebf-3b74-98e1-3cebb7ad8cca	5	This movie was freakin hilarious. The cast was awesome and the comedy was better then part 1..... If your not into ignorance and stupidity... keep scrolling, otherwise, the house next door is a must watch
/m/the_house_next_door_meet_the_blacks_2	223bd3c4-bebf-3b74-98e1-3cebb7ad8cca	5	if you like raunchy movies see it
/m/the_house_next_door_meet_the_blacks_2	223bd3c4-bebf-3b74-98e1-3cebb7ad8cca	5	The movie was funny from beginning to end.
/m/the_house_next_door_meet_the_blacks_2	223bd3c4-bebf-3b74-98e1-3cebb7ad8cca	5	Funny-some jokes will go over many heads but overall good cast/film.
/m/the_house_next_door_meet_the_blacks_2	223bd3c4-bebf-3b74-98e1-3cebb7ad8cca	3	Now listen, 😂 this movie is just so ridiculously silly that you can't help but laugh. you either keep looking at it or say hell naw from the beginning. The question is how did they get all these great comics to sign on for this. It's a little spoofing of other movies and that is hilarious also. it's purely comedy with a little taste of scary. With this cast of characters you get exactly what you think, pure foolishness. Epps and Kat Williams are just ridiculously silly saying all kinds of things. A feel good laugh movie.
/m/great_white	152caa65-5215-32bb-b35c-dfc8573bdd9f	0.5	Terrible. Typical shark movie - ie sharks not acting as the do in real life, characters doing extremely stupid things, people swimming underwater past where the oxygen would last in their lungs, etc. Also, extremely dragged out - you see a couple attacked by a shark early on, but then you're halfway into the movie before you even see another shark. Drags on after that. Waste of an hour and a half.
/m/great_white	152caa65-5215-32bb-b35c-dfc8573bdd9f	4	The movie makes a mix of every shark movie we've seen so far. It's not that original, but it gives what it promises.
/m/great_white	152caa65-5215-32bb-b35c-dfc8573bdd9f	3	Expected bad CGI and poor acting from this unfamiliar cast but was pleasantly surprised. Don't expect anything spectacular. This is a decent entry into the world of shark movies that moves along fairly quickly.
/m/great_white	152caa65-5215-32bb-b35c-dfc8573bdd9f	3.5	It's dumb, but it's fun if you like crazy shark attack movies.
/m/great_white	152caa65-5215-32bb-b35c-dfc8573bdd9f	1	Absolutely awful, the acting consisted of looking at each other in various ways. Really really bad. Felt sorry for the sharks! They acted better!
/m/great_white	152caa65-5215-32bb-b35c-dfc8573bdd9f	0.5	This movie is one of the worst releases this year.  Quality special effects from the syfy channel and not from a Netflix production, too bad.
/m/great_white	152caa65-5215-32bb-b35c-dfc8573bdd9f	0.5	Disaster of a movie and predictable from the outset. Here's the facts.. You can NOT get an android phone as waterpooof as that to last that long under water, Also the scene where they use a dead mans thumb print to unlock the phone is IMPOSSIBLE! - Dead skin cells to do register on fingerprint scanner. This movie literally takes scenes from Jaws 1,2,3 & 4 and puts them into one storyline.. The dead remains washed up on shore (J1), survivors floating out to sea on a raft (J2), Dolphins scene (J3) The plane the shark bites that ends up sinking (J4)..Dont get me started on the embarrasing CGI. Even Shark ado was better than this movie and that's a terrible film. 0/10
/m/great_white	152caa65-5215-32bb-b35c-dfc8573bdd9f	0.5	Good concept, but the movie is one of those kinds of trick movies like Bill and Ted's excellent adventure where you think it's going to be about the stars, but it turns out to be about their daughters. I felt tricked.
/m/great_white	152caa65-5215-32bb-b35c-dfc8573bdd9f	3.5	If you like shark movies, you'll enjoy this one.
/m/great_white	152caa65-5215-32bb-b35c-dfc8573bdd9f	3.5	Great White is a welcome addition to the shark genre. The performances and character development keep you firmly invested. It shows it's teeth, so be prepared for some jump scares. This is worth diving into.
/m/till_death_2021	78250d67-0683-3b2f-9edc-2927d85ae865	2.5	Silly knowing that the Megan's problem couldn't been solved sooner. It's watchable to a point but frustrating knowing she could've been out of the situation sooner.
/m/till_death_2021	78250d67-0683-3b2f-9edc-2927d85ae865	3	A unique horror thriller.  Although inventive in concept, there are so many way-too-obvious near-kill "misses" that it gets repetitive.
/m/till_death_2021	78250d67-0683-3b2f-9edc-2927d85ae865	2.5	Could have been MUCH better.  Megan Fox is terrible.
/m/till_death_2021	78250d67-0683-3b2f-9edc-2927d85ae865	2.5	emotionless action from Megan..
/m/till_death_2021	78250d67-0683-3b2f-9edc-2927d85ae865	4	For the most part, this was quite good.  It was both a dastardly and creative concept.  It's outrageous enough to enjoy for the once off.    I am not a huge fan of Megan Fox.  She has a cold, phony and pompous air that makes it quite difficult to sympathize with her in almost any role.  How cold am I?  I'm so cold that I can't sympathize with Megan Fox when she's chained to her dead husband and being pursued by greedy killers.  Worth my time, but I will not be revisiting this one.
/m/till_death_2021	78250d67-0683-3b2f-9edc-2927d85ae865	1	Uh. Just break his thumb/hand. Problem solved. Couldn't finish it.
/m/till_death_2021	78250d67-0683-3b2f-9edc-2927d85ae865	1.5	Although the movie was high paced and action filled…there were so many details that were overlooked.  Where was the husbands phone, everyone keeps a gas can in their garage, I can barely get my dead husband down the stairs yet I can drag all the up to the second floor, my makeup is always perfect (blood in one scene, none in the next).  Even the Friday the 13th movies have a better design than this one.
/m/till_death_2021	78250d67-0683-3b2f-9edc-2927d85ae865	1	Megan Fox can't act. From the fake crying to the seriously sad wife act it's just bad. Her make up and hair are perfect the entire movie even when splattered with brains. The cinematography was good and the villian was good and that's it. Don't bother watching.
/m/till_death_2021	78250d67-0683-3b2f-9edc-2927d85ae865	5	Dont let the premise of this film make you thibk this is cheap b rated rubbish. Believe me its not, its done brilluantly and has more twists than a formula one track. Fantastic film and great acti g
/m/till_death_2021	78250d67-0683-3b2f-9edc-2927d85ae865	0.5	I don't even know where to start with how bad this movie is. I kept watching,  waiting for the good part to happen and then the movie ended. I found myself saying "come on" and "seriously" during the entire movie. I'd rather get hooked up the chemotherapy again then watch this movie.
/m/the_phantom_2021	f46d3b97-3687-3970-ade6-7e04288dd897	1.5	It looks interesting, but it opens with a desert scene of California and a cowboy riding at full tilt, which is supposed to depict Texas?    Corpus Christi, Texas is subtropical and situated on the Gulf of Mexico.  Kind of ridiculous, but the film makers saved money by not shooting on location.   It makes one anticipate more fabrications.
/m/the_phantom_2021	f46d3b97-3687-3970-ade6-7e04288dd897	3.5	A solid documentary that tells a compelling story.  Clearly, the movie comes with an agenda, and the filmmakers really needed to stretch the story to fill out 90 minutes.  More could have been done to expose the complicity of the police department and district attorneys' office, which would have made the story more compelling.
/m/the_phantom_2021	f46d3b97-3687-3970-ade6-7e04288dd897	4	Texas must be a terrifying place to live. A state that murders innocents. This movie definitively proves just one of the many cases of states murdering innocent citizens.
/m/let_us_in	eaa067fe-5d7c-3fba-a79f-f011c33e1c8e	0.5	so stupid and badly acted.
/m/let_us_in	eaa067fe-5d7c-3fba-a79f-f011c33e1c8e	5	Great family horror movie!!!
/m/let_us_in	eaa067fe-5d7c-3fba-a79f-f011c33e1c8e	4.5	It's hard to find movies that entertain adults but are suitable for children. This is a fantastic family horror movie that you must see!
/m/let_us_in	eaa067fe-5d7c-3fba-a79f-f011c33e1c8e	5	A great, fun kids horror flick sorta like a sci-Fi version of Goonies.  The acting is great and it's a bullseye for the tween & teen crowd who isn't looking for gore.
/m/lansky_2021	254d7a4e-707b-327e-8995-af9cb6fc4f48	2	Slow, uneventful and boring.  While Keitel puts in an admirable performance, it really doesn't take much to sit and talk in a diner.  The movie is structured like an outline of Lansky's life, a different scene for every major event.  But, there is nothing connecting these scenes together into the complete tapestry that was his life, except for the scenes in the diner.  The movie has very little flow, and you end the movie with a feeling that you really never got to know the character.
/m/lansky_2021	254d7a4e-707b-327e-8995-af9cb6fc4f48	4	Very good docu-drama. Keitel was a natural at this. His cool character reminded me of his role in Pulp Fiction.
/m/lansky_2021	254d7a4e-707b-327e-8995-af9cb6fc4f48	3.5	Here's another movie that was mostly panned by the critics but enjoyed by the public.  Harvey Keitel delivers a fabulous performance, and the film ably tells the story of a complicated man.  Lansky was a ruthless gangster, an astute businessman, and a U.S. patriot when it suited him.  He helped fight the Nazi movement in the U.S., and he supported the efforts of Israel.  He was proud of his Jewish and his American heritage.  But, he was a ruthless gangster...
/m/lansky_2021	254d7a4e-707b-327e-8995-af9cb6fc4f48	2	Keitel was outstanding, the movie looked good and was well made.  It just didn't really say anything that wasn't said before.
/m/lansky_2021	254d7a4e-707b-327e-8995-af9cb6fc4f48	4	Those expecting a shoot em up gangster flick will be disappointed (prob a reason for some of the low ratings). Those who like movies that make you think will enjoy this thoughtful story of a conflicted man.
/m/lansky_2021	254d7a4e-707b-327e-8995-af9cb6fc4f48	5	Great biopic all around. Fresh and interesting portrayal of a controversial figure.
/m/lansky_2021	254d7a4e-707b-327e-8995-af9cb6fc4f48	0.5	A forgettable movie with the production standards of a mobster documentary (with reenactments) on the History Channel. Amateurish C-list actors, a nonsensical "biography" side line story and a bare minimum, no thrills direction style. A half of star for the casting of Harvey Keitel and John Magaro, their presence and performances are the only thing noteworthy.
/m/lansky_2021	254d7a4e-707b-327e-8995-af9cb6fc4f48	5	Great film! A fascinating story that is told in a fun and interesting way. Harvey Keitle was brilliant.
/m/lansky_2021	254d7a4e-707b-327e-8995-af9cb6fc4f48	5	This is a great movie, maybe sub-par to other "gangster" flicks, however I doubt it was intended to be as such, great storyline, and believable for a true story, great acting and filmography overall, and for a 82 year old Actor "Touché" can we say talent! I'm super picky, but this had my attention till the end…A must watch!
/m/lansky_2021	254d7a4e-707b-327e-8995-af9cb6fc4f48	4	A reasonably well-told story.  Entertaining.
/m/scenes_from_an_empty_church	2cdb517c-7074-4b0d-ac03-ee7b8e302a0e	5	This is a must see and I loved how Onur Tukel illustrates being human & the human condition during a time when our humanity was tested. His best work yet!
/m/scenes_from_an_empty_church	2cdb517c-7074-4b0d-ac03-ee7b8e302a0e	4.5	This is the first piece of entertainment about the pandemic that captured the emotional reality of living through it.
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	0.5	This movie was so bad I feel terrible for watching it with other people. The story line sucked. I still never learned what was going on. No motives are ever explained. Even the audio control of this movie sucks. Please save you time and scroll past this one.
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	0.5	Worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I feel robbed of time. I am mad at the director, and I feel bad for the actors. Do not watch this movie.
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	1	When you see the bad reviews, believe them, don't watch it's absolutely horrendous.
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	2	With that many great actors you would think this would be a good movie.  Not.  Stupid plot and story.   The background music was so horrible that you could hardly watch some of the scenes.   What happened to the good old gangster movies?  So disappointed in this movie.  It had great potential but it just did not have any legs.
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	4	Well shot and well performed. Worth your time.
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	0.5	Atrocious, lacks any sense of a cohesive anything, just jarring vignettes of random people that do nothing to move this story anywhere.  The entire film is built around a  stolen idea that is a sub-plot in The Godfather #3, (death by cannoli) that the film makers decided to turn this into a painfully dull 90 minutes of absolutely terrible film making, is nowhere near as odd as the fact that no one brought this up as a inspiringly bad idea. Theres so much wrong with this film I can't think of anything good, oh its only 90 minutes, so theres that!
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	4.5	Really good mob film with lots of familiar faces from the Sopranos. Must watch.
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	1	Screaming out Italian mobster clichés, The Birthday Cake puts a solid cast of names with barely anything to do than act like third rate gangsters. Its kinda sad and really dull to get though. Forget about it !!!
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	0.5	This was just terrible,  This film felt like it was hatched at 3 in the morning drunk, like heah wouldn't this be a great idea for a  film?  Uh no it would not.   More holes in the plot then yes swiss cheese.   I guess people forget Scorcese grew up in LITTLE ITALY with actual gangsters, he knows them thats part of why his films about them are so spot on.  These people dont know mobsters and dont know Brooklyn, at all,  what possible neighborhood could this be? are they kidding? have they been to Brooklyn, and we dont mean Williamsburg, honestly could go on and on, but just kinda sad to have this cast and produce this film.  who do I call for my money back!!!!!!
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	5	The depiction of culture was crisp and stylishly expressed, topped with witty dialogue. In the timeframe of just one day, the movie naturally demonstrates the layers and rite of passage of the main character, Gio, through the unfolding of his personality alongside his subtly unknown, yet so important role in the plot.   Though many actors are well-known, I haven't seen them play roles like the ones in "The Birthday Cake," which felt refreshing and tasteful as a viewer. But on top of the individual cast members, it also was the eclectic combination of the cast that felt original and memorable. The incredible cast came together in ways I haven't seen and other films, with a special harmonious synergy.   The film shines through the details. It pulls you in, and makes the storytelling the center of why this movie is a high recommendation in my book.
/m/marathon_2021	89f305e8-86cb-3224-bdd2-63e01598c8db	3.5	Totally irreverent and likable and a hard film to hate.  It's in the mocumentary style and if that's your thing this is your thing.  Acting unknowns and first time filmmakers don't make this any less enjoyable.  The characters are well drawn and the pacing is brisk.  Final Score: 7/10
/m/marathon_2021	89f305e8-86cb-3224-bdd2-63e01598c8db	0.5	Worst movie ever!  Not funny.  Super boring.
/m/marathon_2021	89f305e8-86cb-3224-bdd2-63e01598c8db	0.5	Save your $5.  I have to believe all thr reviews on here and on FB are fake and part of their promotion campaign.
/m/marathon_2021	89f305e8-86cb-3224-bdd2-63e01598c8db	4	This was an excellent film - I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it highly.
/m/marathon_2021	89f305e8-86cb-3224-bdd2-63e01598c8db	0.5	one of the most unfunny films i have ever seen, it tried way to hard to be edgy but is just awful
/m/marathon_2021	89f305e8-86cb-3224-bdd2-63e01598c8db	3.5	Would of been a 5 if it was family friendly, marked down for language, drug and sexual content which just wasn't necessary (IMO). Other than those, I found it hilarious.
/m/marathon_2021	89f305e8-86cb-3224-bdd2-63e01598c8db	1	i wasted money on this one.
/m/marathon_2021	89f305e8-86cb-3224-bdd2-63e01598c8db	3.5	Big time mockumentary guy . Coulda been better but still hit the mark 3.3
/m/marathon_2021	89f305e8-86cb-3224-bdd2-63e01598c8db	5	This was a fun mockumentary style flick. If you're into Christopher Guest style films, you'll appreciate this. There are so many fun running jokes (both jokes about running and gags that keep coming back), and each character is great and likeable for their own reasons. Worth a watch!
/m/the_god_committee	d2b55a90-a01f-3daf-b698-e124bbbbf92e	3.5	It's fine -  I definitely don't regret watching it. It raises some great questions and obviously huge ethical dilemmas. Colman Domingo's performance steals it, he's fantastic. His scene 1:1 with Kelsey Grammer was perfect.  Overall a decent film that could have been maybe 10 minutes longer with some more development in certain scenes.
/m/the_god_committee	d2b55a90-a01f-3daf-b698-e124bbbbf92e	1	The most depressing movie since Nomadland.  I'm about to stop spending my money on these movies.
/m/the_god_committee	d2b55a90-a01f-3daf-b698-e124bbbbf92e	5	Wow this movie was an eye opener into the heart transplant surgery and it was really good to know what goes on behind the curtain. Loved it!!!
/m/the_god_committee	d2b55a90-a01f-3daf-b698-e124bbbbf92e	4	Movie gets into the choices for the haves and have nots. I don't know how anybody could choose who lives and who dies
/m/the_god_committee	d2b55a90-a01f-3daf-b698-e124bbbbf92e	3.5	Grammer proves he still has the chops to act. Stiles was a pleasant surprise, but I did not by into their relationship. I found the story intriguing in a way that had me questioning what I would do in that situation. A little predictable and there is the ethics of operating on animals. Overall, a solid movie.
/m/the_god_committee	d2b55a90-a01f-3daf-b698-e124bbbbf92e	5	The stress of responsibility, the conflict of interests both self and social. The unforgiving judgement and harsher consequences. A heart beating out of time and worth. A committee who collides with all the above and pick one to live on.  A masterpiece about the daily struggles and how they change the lives and attitude of Doctors.
/m/the_god_committee	d2b55a90-a01f-3daf-b698-e124bbbbf92e	3.5	Felt like a depressing Monday morning board meeting. This interesting and unique story - from a play by Mark St. Germain, was written and directed by newb filmmaker Austin Stark, in his second full length feature film.  I haven't seen the play, but the screenplay was only just interesting, and lacking of any real real excitement, or anyone to cheer for. The pacing was too slow, and there just wasn't enough substance to make the 98 min runtime fly by effortlessly. It played well into the Medicine vs. Morality vs. Commerce conflict in the donor decision making process, but that could've easily been portrayed in a much shorter screenplay.  Performances were decent, especially Kelsey Grammer and Julia Stiles (although their relationship wasn't convincing), but in general, the obvious lack of proper "cast direction" from Stark's inexperience was evident. Everyone seemed monotonic in their dialogue and body language.  The cinematography I found a little bland, and the score was nothing really spectacular. Nevertheless, a decent effort and presentation by Stark. If anyone is in the medical field, or has dealt with the donor process, I'd say it's a must-see, as they'll probably appreciate it more than a general audience.
/m/the_god_committee	d2b55a90-a01f-3daf-b698-e124bbbbf92e	4.5	Saw this film at the end of this years Tribeca Film Festival. Well paced and compelling, the movie deals with the complicated issue of organ transplantation- how these decisions are made and how organs are allocated. The cast does a stellar job portraying the various angles and interests of the parties involved. Ethical dilemmas as well as interests both financial and practical are all out on the table as the hospital administration, doctors and medical staff all jockey for what they feel is right and just. There is a lot of ambiguity here as the film plays with whether means justify the end. Colman Domingo, Kelsey Grammar, Julia Styles, and Jeneane Garofolo all do a great job of carrying the film. What I liked most about this film above all is that is that it is very human in its execution. It creates an intricate and complicated scenario and doesn’t really tell you what to think. Highly recommend.
/m/the_god_committee	d2b55a90-a01f-3daf-b698-e124bbbbf92e	5	Kelsey Grammer delivers a brilliant performance in the starring role as a heart surgeon who vales his humanity and his struggle with life-and-death decision making behind a cold and calculating facade. The film is a fascinating peak into a nondescript hospital conference where a handful of hospital staff must grapple with the question, if you can't save everyone, who's truly worth saving?
/m/the_god_committee	d2b55a90-a01f-3daf-b698-e124bbbbf92e	2.5	Very good performances buoy a tv movie at best.
/m/die_in_a_gunfight	f53eaf4e-19ef-3972-a793-5752cb327ca0	5	I'm in love with Travis Fimmel. We need more of him. He is fantastic as the killer hitman.
/m/die_in_a_gunfight	f53eaf4e-19ef-3972-a793-5752cb327ca0	1.5	So, so many problems. So little to hold onto for plot, for motive, for chemistry between the leads.  On the bright side, you can check your email, update your resume, and go get another coke and not miss anything necessary.  Not good.
/m/die_in_a_gunfight	f53eaf4e-19ef-3972-a793-5752cb327ca0	5	A love story movie that was intended to be a little dark with a deeper meaning. I enjoyed the mix of comics like animation with movie shots.  I also did my research on this movie production process and found out that it took almost 6 years to just begin filming it, and when producers were ready to start, Covid-19 happened. Given the situation, I think everyone involved in the process did his/her best.
/m/die_in_a_gunfight	f53eaf4e-19ef-3972-a793-5752cb327ca0	3.5	Romeo and Juliet . I actually liked the style and flow of it . I don’t get the hate I guess it’s because they took a stab at making something Shakespearean 3.3
/m/die_in_a_gunfight	f53eaf4e-19ef-3972-a793-5752cb327ca0	5	Another masterpiece by Schiffli; he's a legend in the making! The red in climactic scenes felt like Scorcese's Mean Streets. Couldn't get enough Fimmel - reminded me of Brad Pitt in Fight Club, but with greater depth of character. Highly recommend, truly a must see!
/m/die_in_a_gunfight	f53eaf4e-19ef-3972-a793-5752cb327ca0	1	Daddario cannot save this filth
/m/die_in_a_gunfight	f53eaf4e-19ef-3972-a793-5752cb327ca0	4	Cute and fun, nothing special.
/m/die_in_a_gunfight	f53eaf4e-19ef-3972-a793-5752cb327ca0	4	Enjoyable and stylized. Travis Fimmel is incredible in this movie.
/m/die_in_a_gunfight	f53eaf4e-19ef-3972-a793-5752cb327ca0	5	Very vintage 90s pop. Was fun to watch with my teen daughters. Had to explain who Jim Morrison was and Nirvana (the 27 club). Son wanted more action, but he liked the hitman character.   Violence and nudity not bad at all.  Language and drug use is prevalent though.
/m/die_in_a_gunfight	f53eaf4e-19ef-3972-a793-5752cb327ca0	0.5	We get it Hollywood. You discovered neon colors and lights. Painful boring drivel, poorly paced with weak performances from everyone involved. Pass.
/m/river_2021	ad4f6adc-fa47-3a6c-95b5-49e9073d1e51	4	Fresh Allegory for Alienation - River follows a long tradition of achingly introspective, dramatic sci-fi all the way back to Asimov. Immersive, character driven stories that require one to do the emotional work along with the protagonist rather than just be passively shocked and prodded for an adrenal squeeze every 58.2 seconds. I was delighted River is not another of the formula retread, timed-to-the-trope, boiler-plate plotters that have taken over sci-fi cinema. Instead, River is a thoughtful, dramatic, psychological suspense that leads you into the dissociative fugue of being alien unto oneself. So, those who can and enjoy swimming the deep, wade on into River.  Writer-Director-Cinematographer Emily Skye throws us, along with the gossamer Mary Cameron Rogers as River Allen, into that uncomfortable limbo of awakening to find you've been living a lie. Having watched twice now, I believe the experiential nature of this film, the 'sitting-in-discomfort' so needed in current times, along with Skye's fresh take on a lesser-known, classic sci-fi incarnation is what won River 30+ awards.  Any student of film or lover of European cinema will recognize the unnerving vibration of early Tony Scott in Emily's production, calling to mind Scott's 1983 'The Hunger' starring David Bowie, Catherine Deneuve, and Susan Sarandon. Though Scott had a decade producing big budget commercials and MGM studios and coin behind him for directing 'The Hunger' (which was first panned, then lauded), Emily Skye, gets close with this bare-bones, truly indie debut.  In River, we will follow Mary's ethereal acting anywhere as lost girl River and float with her on Rona Castrioti's portentious score, supported by a talented cast of: Courtney Gaines as Dr. Glenn, Alexandra Rose as Amanda, Rob Marshall as Jaime, and Becki Hayes as Lois. The intimate performance direction and quality acting talent rise up together with the score and visuals holding us in River's distrust and suspended animation of disorienting anxiety. Ripe for the times, River's ill-fated quest for normalcy is coolly wrapped in the origin story of a non-standard earthling.  If I had one critique for the filmmakers, it's that the quality of the visual story-telling was so strong as to render the internal-monologue voice over completely unnecessary, which then allows her mother's 'voice' greater showcase, but that's a knit pick. Skye got it all on the screen sans explanation, a skill uncommon to 1st timers. Would love to see a more confident cut omitting that bit of telling to let the showing stand on its own.  Societally, and personally, we've all been lied to by those we most trusted and lied to ourselves as a mask for trauma, fear, or shame and rarely known where or even how to start down the path of rediscovery. And if you've never been through the abject longing, aching, and insufferable desperation to crawl right out of your skin, well, it's nearly impossible to convey to others, and that's what makes River a genre-bending, neuvo-retro sci-fi, making it okay for us to sit inside the suffering.  Skye captured invisible, subdermal angst and slides you into that pupa for gestation. When the lights come up, exit the chrysalis, and spread your wings.
/m/river_2021	ad4f6adc-fa47-3a6c-95b5-49e9073d1e51	0.5	I'd rather eat shit than watching this
/m/river_2021	ad4f6adc-fa47-3a6c-95b5-49e9073d1e51	5	OMG my Mary is an amazing actress and she did an amazing job in this movie! She could've warned me though to get my tissues out lol! I love you so much Mary and congrats on the movie😘🥰
/m/ice_guardians_2016	e3405b04-28d9-352e-ae8d-49c9ccae99a5	0.5	Terrible . Utterly terrible hated every moment
/m/ice_guardians_2016	e3405b04-28d9-352e-ae8d-49c9ccae99a5	4.5	This hockey documentary was very good. The entire crew did an excellent job in making this great documentary about the enforcers of the game. It gives an inside look of what these particular hockey players do for their teams and how it helps them win. It's very interesting and entertaining. If you're a hockey fan or not, you'll enjoy this documentary no matter what. It's worth it.
/m/ice_guardians_2016	e3405b04-28d9-352e-ae8d-49c9ccae99a5	2	A documentary from the enforcer's point of view in fighting in hockey. A pretty misguided film that defends a bygone era of hockey. Basically just a bunch of enforcers and fighting fans sitting around and talking about how fighting hockey is important and that concussions come from other hits and not fighting. Crazy amounts of denial. I'm a big hockey fan and this documentary caught my eye. Wish I had kept scrolling.
/m/ice_guardians_2016	e3405b04-28d9-352e-ae8d-49c9ccae99a5	4.5	Great documentary and a great insight in the world of Enforcer
/m/ice_guardians_2016	e3405b04-28d9-352e-ae8d-49c9ccae99a5	4	Great insight on the practically discontinued role of the enforcer in the NHL. Showed both pros and cons on fighting and established the actual danger currently in the game. #GoStars
/m/ice_guardians_2016	e3405b04-28d9-352e-ae8d-49c9ccae99a5	4	Solid documentary about the almost extinct role of enforcers in the NHL....and as a side note, " if the league truly wants fewer concussions, they should lift the instigator rule, expand the playing surface and ban neutral zone body checking. " amen
/m/ice_guardians_2016	e3405b04-28d9-352e-ae8d-49c9ccae99a5	5	Great documentary, well done and great insight for a newbie to the sport.
/m/ice_guardians_2016	e3405b04-28d9-352e-ae8d-49c9ccae99a5	5	What more can you say that hasn't already been covered in the previous reviews? Incredible piece put together regarding a delicate situation in pro sports. More people ought to sit down and watch this movie as it would help them better understand hockey and the fighting being allowed in the game. Many great interviews and thoughts provided by the many players that contributed, they probably could've made this an 8-hour movie with all of the interviews compiled for this project. Thanks again for providing all of this wrapped up in one flick.
/m/ice_guardians_2016	e3405b04-28d9-352e-ae8d-49c9ccae99a5	4.5	Excellent documentary
/m/dream_horse	66b81609-f31c-3caf-9efd-b30d27b37b1f	4.5	I really enjoyed this.  It's light hearted and inspiring.  I love that it's based on a true story.  It's uplifting to see people happy.  Great human story here.  Well worth my time.  Great cast.  What's not to like?
/m/dream_horse	66b81609-f31c-3caf-9efd-b30d27b37b1f	3	Pleasant, but you know the story going in and so many films tell it better.
/m/dream_horse	66b81609-f31c-3caf-9efd-b30d27b37b1f	5	I really liked the fact that it was made from a true story.
/m/dream_horse	66b81609-f31c-3caf-9efd-b30d27b37b1f	5	Wonderful story of love, unity, and triumph!
/m/dream_horse	66b81609-f31c-3caf-9efd-b30d27b37b1f	5	Such an uplifting movie. Loved All the characters!
/m/dream_horse	66b81609-f31c-3caf-9efd-b30d27b37b1f	5	Let's face it, life is tough these days. Lots of negativity in the MSM and with people in general. So when I go to a theatre I like to see a good story line and leave the movie feeling better then when I came in. This movie easily ticked both of those boxes.
/m/dream_horse	66b81609-f31c-3caf-9efd-b30d27b37b1f	0.5	Boring.  So formulaic
/m/dream_horse	66b81609-f31c-3caf-9efd-b30d27b37b1f	3.5	If you're in a bad mood or feel down, 'Dream Horse' is just the kind of pick-me-up you need.  A feel-good movie with a fantastic cast, it's based on a wonderful true story.  If the final scene in this film doesn't make you smile then you must not have a pulse! Toni Collette is magnificent.  She has an ability, even in scenes which are limited, to make the audience feel her emotions.  She's one of the best and doesn't get enough recognition.  You may have to use the subtitles considering there are some deep Welsh accents, but don't let that deter you from watching!  It's heartwarming and lovely even if it's disjointed at times! Final Score: 7/10
/m/dream_horse	66b81609-f31c-3caf-9efd-b30d27b37b1f	2.5	Dream Horse (D+) (66) Much better horse family movies out there. Kind of was boring in the middle and just felt very meh...
/m/dream_horse	66b81609-f31c-3caf-9efd-b30d27b37b1f	4	This was a really good movie. Loved the beautiful shots of the Wales countryside, and the story was really good. This is worth the watch and is honestly a great family movie. Very nice!!
/m/funny_face_2021	8d2f5d32-c831-4ef6-9a8f-1b09c80d1134	0.5	Dumpster fire bad!  Even worse.  Nomadland bad!  Worse movie I've ever watched.  Wife asked me to turn off after first 5 minutes.  Constant filming of nothing.  Walking.  Staring.  Laying down.  Sitting.  No dialogue.  Just constant B roll worthy effort.  What a waste of life.  Skip this one the reviews are a complete lie.
/m/funny_face_2021	8d2f5d32-c831-4ef6-9a8f-1b09c80d1134	5	it looks a little funny
/m/funny_face_2021	8d2f5d32-c831-4ef6-9a8f-1b09c80d1134	0.5	To call this a film, let alone a good one, is an insult to cinema and an even bigger insult to art house/independent films. This is my first review on RT and I made this account specifically for this film. BEWARE. The title and the brief synopsis spell tension. Thriller. Excitement. Slow burn even. Well surprise, there is none of any of it. This is supposed to be a revenge flick but no one is ever killed, hurt, or even inflicted with an harm whatsoever. A 90min borefest. The awful one note score/music will drive you mad. The pointless overextended camera scenes of nothingness will also drive you mad. The only bright spot is the amazing performance by the lead actor. Bravo, but even that couldn’t save this film. I gravitate towards indie films but this...NO THANKS!
/m/funny_face_2021	8d2f5d32-c831-4ef6-9a8f-1b09c80d1134	2	A interesting story, and great performances, wasted with bad direction, and incoherent plot.
/m/funny_face_2021	8d2f5d32-c831-4ef6-9a8f-1b09c80d1134	0.5	meh film is all i have to say
/m/drunk_bus	d29c55ba-6d64-42a2-b2ce-4af61a3b55a8	3.5	You most likely know Charlie Tahan from Ozark, but he shifts into a starring turn with ease and could be one of my new favorite young actors.  Tahan pulls off awkward as well as it can be done.  Forgive some of the disjointed acting and the overdone gimmicks and you have a totally enjoyable film that's occasionally funny and most definitely well thought out.  There's a college bus at fictional Kent Tech that is nicknamed the "Drunk Bus" because the passengers late at night are often drunk.  There are times the movie is serious, but you'll quickly learn that the message here is friendship and finding yourself in a tone that isn't stuffy.  Final Score: 6.7/10
/m/drunk_bus	d29c55ba-6d64-42a2-b2ce-4af61a3b55a8	5	This was a really great story that brings back all the nostalgia of college life and the struggles of navigating your path at this typically tumultuous life stage.
/m/drunk_bus	d29c55ba-6d64-42a2-b2ce-4af61a3b55a8	3.5	Giving it 3.5 instead of 3 because there's so few good movies these days. Technically this is a "meh passed the time" type movie. I'm just glad it avoided a few shitty cliches which would be a) guy gets the girl at the end b) frat douche named chad c) that in general losing your virginity isn't some great thing. It's awkward, weird, and fast. You might remember it differently but let's face it. You're lying to yourself.
/m/drunk_bus	d29c55ba-6d64-42a2-b2ce-4af61a3b55a8	5	Very sweet and very funny coming of age story that I believe is based at least partially on a real campus phenomenon (inc. Pineapple, who is a very memorable character). Low-budget movies are really tricky to pull off, but the creative team here did a great job. It's a shame that the pandemic robbed them of their ability to enjoy a deserved SXSW premiere, but this movie should find an audience online in the coming years. Highly recommended.
/m/drunk_bus	d29c55ba-6d64-42a2-b2ce-4af61a3b55a8	5	An unexpected gem of a film that shines a light on a young man's murky passageway through the remnants of his bruised and broken expectations and into something more. It's striking and heartfelt, but also hilarious, irreverent, and relatable. Michael - the driver of the titular bus - has graduated college but not quite moved on. Literally and figuratively, he's stuck in a loop, and the process of growth that unfolds - despite his best efforts to avoid it - is a real ride. Directed by John Carlucci and Brandon LaGanke, the film itself is lovingly shot, communicating the atmosphere and energy of the college experience through the dazed and defeated perspective of our unlikely protagonist. The screenplay by Chris Molinaro presents a small cast of characters that light up the screen, but feel true and lived in. OZARK's Charlie Tahan as Michael, and co-star Pineapple Tangaroa as Pineapple achieve a chemistry that is both comic and captivating. It drives the story, as they find purpose in the crossroads. Did I mention it's funny? Because it definitely is. Don't miss this promising debut.
/m/drunk_bus	d29c55ba-6d64-42a2-b2ce-4af61a3b55a8	5	as a product of the early 00s college experience, i appreciate this content. given that this is called 'drunk bus,' i may have watched this with a drink, or three. as this is the first time i've seen an accurate depiction of an inebriated college co-ed's lack of control over her sphincter, this is also the first time i've laughed out loud at a movie in a very long time. there are so many colossal scenes over the course of this film - it's worth a watch. anyone saying the opposite clearly has zero sense of humor, and probably a very large stick up their backside.
/m/drunk_bus	d29c55ba-6d64-42a2-b2ce-4af61a3b55a8	5	Hilarious, relaxing and enjoyable movie without any underlying Hollywood motive behind the comedy!
/m/drunk_bus	d29c55ba-6d64-42a2-b2ce-4af61a3b55a8	5	This was a shock of a good movie. It's set up like a low brow buddy movie but it turns out serious and funny. And it was half price so even better.
/m/drunk_bus	d29c55ba-6d64-42a2-b2ce-4af61a3b55a8	3.5	Film will make you smile, laugh and relate to it if you have pulse
/m/drunk_bus	d29c55ba-6d64-42a2-b2ce-4af61a3b55a8	5	Drunk Bus is a fantastic story start to finish. Wonderful characters and a story that has something worthwhile to say. Couldn't recommend it more
/m/skull_the_mask	29ffbb96-4918-448b-aafc-9fca8eda7119	1.5	Dull and pointless! Only somewhat redeeming factor was the gore!
/m/skull_the_mask	29ffbb96-4918-448b-aafc-9fca8eda7119	5	Great gore heavy horror movie. Felt like real cinema not some Hollywood formula crap. A few B movie knocks but well worth the watch.
/m/skull_the_mask	29ffbb96-4918-448b-aafc-9fca8eda7119	1.5	Skull: The Mask, known as Skull: A Máscara de Anhangá (Skull: The Mask of Anhangá) in its native Brazil has an incredible trailer, an awesome poster, plenty of goretastic practical effects and, well, that's about it.  That should be enough, but this movie never gets to the sheer level of intensity and madness that it hints that it's ready to achieve.  Beatriz Obdias is a bad cop who has stumbled on the titular mask, which was on its way to a museum when it was stolen. Now, dead bodies are piling up, as the mask has possessed a crime scene cleaner (pro wrestler Rurik Jr.) and is using him to satiate its unending bloodlust, because after all, Anhangá is a pre-Colombian spirit that wanders the Earth after death. This version of the spirit has a gigantic meat cleaver and is constantly covered in blood.  There's also the museum owner who wants the mask for himself and a man named Marco who wants to protect the mask, which his family has a long history with. He walks around with a severed hand, which ties in to the bloody prologue.  I really wanted this movie to succeed, because the effects look incredible and I can overlook so much in a slasher. But it just drags and just when you think things are going to go fully off the wall, it slows down again.
/m/the_oak_room	7a66f999-dedb-4de2-893d-b42e2b813721	0.5	If you enjoy single scene, repetitive, meaningless stories that don't advance the plot told by shallow characters with limited emotional range and short, anticlimactic endings, this is the movie for you. It was so compelling I created a RottenTomatoes account just so I could possibly save one other person from this slow, painful torture.
/m/the_oak_room	7a66f999-dedb-4de2-893d-b42e2b813721	3	Really meh film. Would definitely benefit from more action. But the cast are great.
/m/the_oak_room	7a66f999-dedb-4de2-893d-b42e2b813721	4.5	Some tremendous acting by Mitte, Outerbridge, et al., to frame this truly original film. It's not what you expect, and it has some really funny parts to go along with the claustrophobic noir.
/m/the_oak_room	7a66f999-dedb-4de2-893d-b42e2b813721	2	This was so boring I found it hard to stay awake.  Nothing about this movie is in any way exciting, interesting or thrilling. Watch it if you are having trouble sleeping.  😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴 😴
/m/the_oak_room	7a66f999-dedb-4de2-893d-b42e2b813721	1	Great for inducing sleep.
/m/the_oak_room	7a66f999-dedb-4de2-893d-b42e2b813721	4.5	Definitely a slow burn but absolutely intriguing, love the concept of a story within a story within. Beautifully executed and for me at least it definitely worked.
/m/the_oak_room	7a66f999-dedb-4de2-893d-b42e2b813721	4	I thought This movie was very well done. Good acting and at the same time very seedy characters. This one is worth a look.
/m/the_oak_room	7a66f999-dedb-4de2-893d-b42e2b813721	1	I gave this about 20mins before I switched it off. The acting was junior high school level and the story to that point was just plain dull with nothing to make you want to keep watching. I don't know what film the critics watched but it can't of been the same one I did. Save your money, save your time, save yourself and watch something else.
/m/the_oak_room	7a66f999-dedb-4de2-893d-b42e2b813721	0.5	Do you want a movie review? Well, let me tell you a story. Once there was a website that hosted movie reviews. Someone posted a pretty boring movie review, and it sounded like this: "A guy asked another guy his opinion of a movie. That guy said "I'll tell you story about a movie review. It was in a newspaper. It was about a movie about movie reviews. In it, this one guy started talking about a movie opinion he heard another guy have once.""  Now you've basically seen The Oak Room.  I logged back into this account after nine years just to warn people off of this movie, which I stupidly paid good money for based solely on the ludicrous 89% fresh rating. Nothing interesting happens until 68 minutes into this sleep-aid of a low-budget joke. Up until that moment, the movie is 99% guys telling bartenders pointless stories about other guys in other bars telling bartenders stories. Avoid this movie.
/m/the_oak_room	7a66f999-dedb-4de2-893d-b42e2b813721	0.5	God awful. Stories barely tie into each other.
/m/the_world_to_come	a87323ce-e318-4a99-a825-4e5720115a2b	5	I enjoyed the movie very much.  Wonderful acting and lovely scenery.
/m/the_world_to_come	a87323ce-e318-4a99-a825-4e5720115a2b	3.5	Mopey af, but then Casey Affleck so as expected. Well acted, well shot, pacing was slow but suitable, not too overly dramatic, tells a sweet somewhat sad, poetic story
/m/the_world_to_come	a87323ce-e318-4a99-a825-4e5720115a2b	5	O filme é simplesmente perfeito! O espectador fica preso durante todo enredo do filme. A história é intensa e captura nossa antenção de uma forma inimaginável. Particularmente eu repeti a experiência durante um dia inteiro. A atuação da Vanessa Kirby é impactante, ela captura nossa atenção sempre que entra em cena e a Katherine Waterston me fez perder o fôlego durante toda atuação kkkk, simplesmente perfeitas 🖤
/m/the_world_to_come	a87323ce-e318-4a99-a825-4e5720115a2b	4	Heartbreaking. Breathtaking.  Highly recommended! Both actresses gave their best performance to date, beautifully directed by Mona. get ready to cry the shit out of you.
/m/the_world_to_come	a87323ce-e318-4a99-a825-4e5720115a2b	5	A poetic masterpiece of female connection, subtelty and tenderness. Excellent photography, dialogues and narration. The lead actresses' chemistry and acting is beyond anything. Such a treat!
/m/the_world_to_come	a87323ce-e318-4a99-a825-4e5720115a2b	5	If you watch patiently, I think this is a very good movie. The two actresses are very skilled in acting, which makes me believe that they really love each other in the movie. And the movie scene is very beautiful and the plot content is also very deep. I like it very much.  I think this movie is underestimated. Finally, please watch it patiently.
/m/the_world_to_come	a87323ce-e318-4a99-a825-4e5720115a2b	1	1 out of 5 stars. The World to Come is a horrible drama film. About a house wife who falls for another woman. While her husband has been neglected on her feelings. Its a forbidden love story. Sadly, the direction is slow and boring. The performances are hollow with the cast. The music score is like nails on a chalkboard. The film is tedious and boring. And very hard to get into it.
/m/the_world_to_come	a87323ce-e318-4a99-a825-4e5720115a2b	3	New York, 1856, THE WORLD TO COME stars Casey Affleck and Katherine Waterston as Dyer and Abigail, a grieving couple who just recently lost their only child Nellie. Dyer is a wounded man, both physically and emotionally. He pours himself into his work, constantly keeping busy, in order to not have to cope with the loss, while also wanting to attempt at having another child with Abigail. Not as busy and unsatisfied with her domestic duties, Abigail is not ready for that step yet. As they grow apart, the distance is exacerbated when new neighbors Finney and Tallie move in. Abigail and Tallie quickly strike up a friendship that soon becomes more than that: forbidden love. Due to the time period and society's unaccepting nature of a lesbian couple, they must keep it quite. There are times throughout the film where there is some tension, wondering if the couple will be found out by their husbands or an unsuspecting passerby. Dyer and Finney only seem to talk about their work, whereas the women talk about writing, poems, and literature (they also appear to be more intellectual than the brute men). Waterston plays the delicate flower, while Vanessa Kirby is more the free spirit of the couple. An enjoyable watch that's somewhat reminiscent of a female version of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.
/m/the_world_to_come	a87323ce-e318-4a99-a825-4e5720115a2b	2	Slow and at times unbelievable. Acting by all actors superb. Looked historically accurate. Plot sort of went nowhere except into depression.
/m/the_world_to_come	a87323ce-e318-4a99-a825-4e5720115a2b	3.5	surprisingly good i had low expectations considering its another white woman period piece
/m/stalker_2021	f168f030-6037-36ed-a685-8dfc5f477834	2	Difficult to review without spoilers so I'll do my best. The film's plot is extremely similar to a movie called Derailed with Jennifer Aniston. The villain is a borderline omniscient Mary Sue character that makes no mistakes, has no emotions, and whose motivations exist only to facilitate the plot of a movie. None of the characters behave in a way actual people would in these circumstances, and every scene seems utterly false as a result. Every character behaves exactly as the villain wants and expects them to, making the film feel like a deranged power fantasy of its writer.
/m/stalker_2021	f168f030-6037-36ed-a685-8dfc5f477834	3.5	Andy (played by Vincent Van Horn)  moves to LA after a romantic breakup and following a bar room encounter with Sam (played by Christine Ko) takes a drive home  by an Uber style driver. Roger (played by Michael Lee Joplin), the driver then encounters Andy the following day and strike up a friendship, which we the audience know wont end well for one of them as Roger gives off the ‘creepy' vibe straight from the off.  Andy does the polite thing and totally ignores the creepy angle  and agrees to meet Roger to further their friendship (big  mistake isnt it!!)   One of the many things I love about Stalker is that it doesn't hide the creepiness of Roger and the film is better for that option. It reminds us that there are creepy people out there and we aren't always shocked when they turn out to be a little unhinged.  When Andy's blossoming connection with Sam continues, Roger pretty quickly turns somewhat jealous, and obsessive and sends text after text to Andy, and doesn't like that Andy's attention is elsewhere. But it goes beyond text, and some scenes showing how Roger uses modern technology to enter someones lies, ir a little jarring and will make you think about the security in your own life.   I love these sort of films, and whilst Stalker isn't a subtle hidden meaning type of movie, it doesn't need to be, and Stalker is all the better for that. the film is a tight, perfectly paced thriller with the great leads in the cast (especially Christine Ko) , and the filmmakers make great use of the LA landscape. Quick side note, the film used to go under the title of ‘Blinders'   I highly recommend the film if you want to put your feet up, and escape into a psychological for 90 mins.
/m/stalker_2021	f168f030-6037-36ed-a685-8dfc5f477834	3	This movie was alright. Pretty twisted! 7/10 hated the ending tbh
/m/stalker_2021	f168f030-6037-36ed-a685-8dfc5f477834	4.5	This is creepy AF. I loved it. Really makes you think twice about people. You just never really know who someone really is. Great acting, dialogue, story.
/m/stalker_2021	f168f030-6037-36ed-a685-8dfc5f477834	4.5	A thriller and a horror! Won’t go into the horror part, but it is not throughout and not very bloody. But the thriller part grabbed me for sure. The actors and the writing pull you in. Loved the guy from Austin. And his dog. Scared of the driver guy. Well-written and directed, never a dull moment!
/m/stalker_2021	f168f030-6037-36ed-a685-8dfc5f477834	3.5	A tad bit WAY too sadistic for me, though I appreciate the small nuggets of comedy sprinkled throughout.
/m/akillas_escape	ac0ac0db-aee4-49c5-b12b-a65585ac87f7	5	A hauntingly beautiful tale of redemption and fatherhood. Saul Williams is a movie star. Highly recommend. Take it in.
/m/akillas_escape	ac0ac0db-aee4-49c5-b12b-a65585ac87f7	3	Saul Williams' aging, world-weary face and the cinematography make this watchable, but the writing is basic, riddled with cliches and all-too-familiar tough-guy gangster posturing.
/m/akillas_escape	ac0ac0db-aee4-49c5-b12b-a65585ac87f7	3	Pretty conventional on many levels and on most of its story beats. Has some good acting and ideas but it's stuck in usual gang story.
/m/luca_2021	8b5bcaff-490a-438a-b572-367251479a2e	3	entertaining enough.  What you would expect from the genre.
/m/luca_2021	8b5bcaff-490a-438a-b572-367251479a2e	3.5	Luca started off as a warm movie without a complex theme embedded to it. A recommended movie for families especially children as it tackles acceptance and friendship simply and authentically. As to its rewatch value I'm going to give this a "good stamp."
/m/luca_2021	8b5bcaff-490a-438a-b572-367251479a2e	5	Luca is smaller in scale than Pixar's previous work but it is an accurate representation of a nice slice of summer life that is enjoyable to watch.
/m/luca_2021	8b5bcaff-490a-438a-b572-367251479a2e	4.5	I cried like a little baby while watching this. Luca proves that a movie doesn't have to be overly serious, packed with action, or thematically dark in order to tell a rich story. It's simplicity, summer-time fun, and childish wonder drew me in completely, and I completely fell in love with it. So lovely.
/m/luca_2021	8b5bcaff-490a-438a-b572-367251479a2e	4	Nice story... with some nice findings. Just Fun to watch
/m/luca_2021	8b5bcaff-490a-438a-b572-367251479a2e	3	Solo para matar el rato, no es tan buena como otras películas de Pixar
/m/luca_2021	8b5bcaff-490a-438a-b572-367251479a2e	5	Luca is Disney and Pixar's latest adventure.  It tells the story of 2 sea monster friends Luca and Alberto who try to win a Vesper to have some freedom in their lives until they Meet Gulia who tells the boys about the wonders of school and education. so Luca's heart is stuck between freedom and education and staying with Gulio while people try hunting them down.  First off: This Movie visually is stunning. It kind of reminds me of Dreamworks Trolls with the beautiful visuals and colours. if 3D was still a thing this movie would look outstanding.  Story: This maybe one of Pixar's most heartfelt story since Inside Out. I Love the idea of a movie about 3 best friends just looking out for each other and spending summer together. it takes me back to my childhood with my best friends.  Characters: each character has an actual goal. some films have characters that serves no purpose they would of been better of not being in the film. NOT LUCA. Each character does something important to not help one another BUT help each other like real friends. Luca's purpose is to go to school and be accepted so he can have an education. Alberto's purpose is to win a Vesper and travel the world, Gulia's purpose is to win the Italian show thing just to show the bullies that they are wrong about her.  Overall Luca is a perfect movie for kids and adults to enjoy and one that would be great to watch during the 6 weeks holidays in summer, oh and it's so worth seeing in 4K.  10/10
/m/luca_2021	8b5bcaff-490a-438a-b572-367251479a2e	5	I like when they meet each other
/m/luca_2021	8b5bcaff-490a-438a-b572-367251479a2e	5	Like one of those summer vacations you remember fondly. This movie is a pleasant experience. This movie surprised me, no doubt this movie is overrated because it reminds you of your childhood, so it left me gripped on the screen.Throughout the movie I could see that it's a fun and unpredictable movie, so I recommend it .
/m/luca_2021	8b5bcaff-490a-438a-b572-367251479a2e	5	Beautiful movie! We enjoyed it very much!!!
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	4.5	Well written movie with great acting. I'm glad I watched it.
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	0.5	My wife and I watched this together after it received reviews in excess of 90%. There must be some kind of scam going on because this is among the worst films I have ever watched and I am close to 50 now and have watched a lot of films. It’s made the bottom 10. Absolute garbage.
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	3.5	Great movie for 50ish folks looking to get pandered too in the best ways so we have knowledge we're not alone in getting old with bad knees and sore backs, but that we are still worthy.
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	3	This tongue-in-cheek kung fu movie has a few laughs and is fun to watch. THE PAPER TIGERS plays like the armchair quarterback dad turned out to really have some skillz at the game, having to break off the rust and get back out there for one final push to the endline.
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	3	Without higher hopes this movie is a very good choice, but when you demand something it's not stay here for you. Truly disappointing. 6/10
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	4	A random Saturday with time to kill, remember hearing this was pretty good and saw it in the Netflix queue.  I'm so glad I gave it a watch, figured I would play it in the background while playing a computer game and had to stop gaming to watch the movie.  It was a very pleasant surprise, with some great performances, drama, and comedy.  Well worth a watch, especially if you like some some martial arts mixed with comedy in an old school way.
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	4	Gung fu Panda lol.   The biggest and only appeal of this movie on Netflix for me was that it was written and directed by a Vietnamese person. And I'm glad that I decided to watch this movie.  What I loved the most were the jokes. There were the typical jokes where characters acting goofy, and then some were quite racist and crude jokes. Some might not like these, but I was cracking multiple times throughout. The goofiest character was for sure Carter because he acted like those racist white people trying to impersonate gung fu moves. So yeah, you gotta go to this movie with the right mindset to not get offended.   The choreography was decent, not anything impressive like those other fitting action movies. Some parts were cheesy as heck. However, it's clear that the fight wasn't the main intention. Instead, the movie focused on the theme of standing up and fight when necessary for honor. I was surprised that there was heart to the story. It was shown amazingly through the scene between the main character and his son on the phone.   As for problems, I wanted to know more about the main character's past to understand his motivation more. I already said this but some parts, not just the fights, were cheesy.  Overall, a funny and entertaining movie with a good heart. 8/10
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	3	Rating: 6|10. 62|100
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	5	Loved this movie. Reminded me a bit of Kung Fu theatre from the 70's and 80's but with good acting, and a good story:)
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	5	Awesome movie hope for a prequel or sequel
/m/my_tender_matador	47391981-9c1b-4955-949e-9e7e8e1284e7	5	A beautiful and moving relationship with an older drag queen and a handsome young man that almost solidify a relationship.  You have got to see this thru to the end, its very similar to KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN!!!!!
/m/my_tender_matador	47391981-9c1b-4955-949e-9e7e8e1284e7	5	One of the most beautiful movie there I ever saw.
/m/escape_from_extinction	5f864278-643f-491d-b0cd-c1b3527ce0e9	5	I am posting this for my friend, Betsy Burkhardt  I recently saw the movie, Escape from Extinction, twice within one week.  As a whole-hearted animal-lover, the movie was both invigorating and sobering at the same time.   One of the main focal points is educating the public, who are often misinformed about zoos and aquariums, with the belief that the animals are just at the zoos/aquariums and are held there in captivity, so that we humans can gawk at them.  The movie offers information on how current zoos and aquariums are essential for the rescue and rehabilitation of animals that are on the verge of extinction.  These are accredited institutions that rescue animals and clean the oil off of animals after huge ocean oil spills/people who take in infant polar bears, elephants, and rhinos, who are starving to death because their mother has been shot to death.  Giving these animals food and connection to social skills.  These are just a few examples of how accredited zoos have dramatically kept many species from going extinct.   I lived in Zambia for three years and was fortunate to go to the Lilayi Elephant Nursery, just outside of Lusaka, the Capitol.  Here, orphaned elephants are relocated from where poachers have killed their mother,  in order to saw off her tusks.  These baby elephants are often starving and in need milk as well as social interaction.  It is an amazing place, one set up by the African Elephant Orphanage Project, (EOP).  Of note is that each baby elephant has it's own human who acts as a parent to the baby elephant…..feeding it milk from a bottle, stroking it, going on walks with the other orphaned elephants.  Also, these caretakers sleep above their chosen baby elephant.  When ready, the elephants are returned to the wild.   From the movie, I learned a lot about "keystone species".  These animals, like the grey wolf in Yellowstone National Park, are essential species to their ecosystem because the ecosystem largely depends on it such that if that particular keystone species is removed, the whole ecosystem, including plants, will change dramatically.  The grey wolf once had a huge population when Yellowstone was established in 1872.  Sadly, with the migration of people from the East to the West Coast, many grey wolves were shot to death.   Grey wolf packs were often seen in abundance in the 1800s.  Sadly, by 1926, the last wolf pack in Yellowstone, was killed off.  With a lot of work and determination, accredited zoos were able to breed the few remaining grey wolves who lived in the other 48 states, and were able to restore a population of grey wolves to Yellowstone.   We humans have created a horrendous global environment.  Plastic kills animals daily, global warming has contributed to huge fires, like the current ones in California and Australia, killing thousands of animals.  Illegal trade of animals still continues.  Poachers in Africa and elsewhere are still abundant and endangered animals, like the black rhino that lives in Zambia, have had to have their horns sawed off and have park rangers, equipped with guns,  follow the rhinos daily to make sure they remain safe from poachers.   Lastly, most people are aware of the movie "Freeing Willy".  People protested against aquariums, and they wanted Keiko (the real name of the whale), to be returned to the ocean and then he would no longer live in the confining aquarium at  Sea World.  Sadly, Keiko who had lived all of his adult life at Sea World, could not be taught to live in the wild.  Confining a wild killer whale will take away all of the whale's instincts on how to live in the wild.  Keiko could not fend for himself and would swim up to boats asking to be fed and rubbed.  Keiko ended up dying.  It turns out that trying to recreate these natural instincts for Keiko can only be taught by "nature" from the start, when they are born and are raised by their pod.  Escape from Extinction is an extraordinarily good movie.  I highly recommend seeing it.  Betsy Burkhardt
/m/escape_from_extinction	5f864278-643f-491d-b0cd-c1b3527ce0e9	5	This show was so moving.  The photography was amazing.  The job  that accredited Zoos are doing to help animals and to prevent extinction is something I was not fully aware of.  A Wonderful educational 90 minutes.  This is a great show for the family, I am coming back with my grandkids.
/m/escape_from_extinction	5f864278-643f-491d-b0cd-c1b3527ce0e9	5	Very interesting, educational and informative.Excellent narration with great photography. Understanding the issues that has caused extinction with so many species and having viewers see what accredited zoos are actually doing to preserve wildlife for the future is outstanding. Very well done documentary.
/m/escape_from_extinction	5f864278-643f-491d-b0cd-c1b3527ce0e9	5	The movie was educational and entertaining. This is a must see for children to learn more about extinction, I learned so much as an adult. It was truly enlightening. I havent walked away from a movie and thought about it after like I have a ton this one in a long time.
/m/escape_from_extinction	5f864278-643f-491d-b0cd-c1b3527ce0e9	5	Excellent story that portrays the valuable role of certified zoos to conserve wild animals.
/m/escape_from_extinction	5f864278-643f-491d-b0cd-c1b3527ce0e9	5	If you want a better understanding of your environment, or how all the pieces fit together in this world, THIS IS IT!  Very well presented.  From the role of plankton, global warming, natural disasters and pollution. To the release of the killer whale that starred in 'Free Willy'.  Mankind needs to take aggressive action to promote the healing of the ecosystem!  It truly is not an option.  It is crucial for animal survival and the survival of man.   This movie is an excellent source to understand how these connections all depend upon one another.  Let each of us work on making a better tomorrow for the generations to come for  💛. ✌️!
/m/escape_from_extinction	5f864278-643f-491d-b0cd-c1b3527ce0e9	5	This is an amazing film offering both the history and current condition of our animal planet.  Showcased are efforts around the world to preserve and bring back species that are on the brink of extinction.  A must see film.
/m/escape_from_extinction	5f864278-643f-491d-b0cd-c1b3527ce0e9	5	Definitely recommend this movie! Very educational and fun to watch. My kids loved it and the movie left them excited to learn more about the animals. Showed us a lot more than we thought we knew and we loved it!!
/m/escape_from_extinction	5f864278-643f-491d-b0cd-c1b3527ce0e9	5	This movie is so touching and informational. It explains the impact that humans are having on our ecosystem. Just the option of having such a informational resource is huge. We dont know what we dont know! Seeing this movie will hopefully help you make healthier choices for our animals and our earth. Which as a result will make you feel better as a human being. Definitely worth it!
/m/escape_from_extinction	5f864278-643f-491d-b0cd-c1b3527ce0e9	5	If you were moved even a little by the film Blackfish you should absolutely watch this docufilm. Escape from extinction, is as informative as it is beautiful. Eye and mind opener, I hope everyone in the world takes the time to watch this film.
/m/the_get_together	874efe78-7070-43f6-99ac-f87a52511e2e	5	Excellent movie. Very well written, it surprised me.
/m/the_get_together	874efe78-7070-43f6-99ac-f87a52511e2e	5	Memories of house parties and overdue late nights with old friends seem distant with covid so close in our review mirror, and The Get Together reminds us of all the richness we've missed. With first-rate cinematography and music, the film captures the feeling of dissonance after college while inviting us into our own stories of growing up, letting go, and going back to what really matters.
/m/the_get_together	874efe78-7070-43f6-99ac-f87a52511e2e	5	Quirky, relatable, and all around good time!
/m/the_get_together	874efe78-7070-43f6-99ac-f87a52511e2e	5	Loved it!! The characters were great and loved the intertwining stories. This is a must see for sure!
/m/the_get_together	874efe78-7070-43f6-99ac-f87a52511e2e	5	all the huzzahs for this film that takes me back - creative, hilarious, inspiring... truly a must see.
/m/the_get_together	874efe78-7070-43f6-99ac-f87a52511e2e	5	A fast-paced, fun little indie film about three intersecting story lines during a house party. I laughed a handful of times.
/m/the_get_together	874efe78-7070-43f6-99ac-f87a52511e2e	5	This movie is super cute and fun!
/m/the_get_together	874efe78-7070-43f6-99ac-f87a52511e2e	5	The characters were relatable and seeing their stories weave together in Austin, TX was a lot of fun to watch. Great cast and great vibe! Highly recommend.
/m/julia_scotti_funny_that_way	5e1caf77-9a88-482f-b2af-4744e6bb4c32	4	This is a charming and honest documentary about a transgender comedian I first saw perform in Nantucket in 2014. The filmmaker uses archival images and present-day footage effectively to tell Julia's story without resorting to emotional manipulation. And the animated inserts are great. The resulting film is funny, thought-provoking, and a tribute to its subject's unique journey. By avoiding the pitfalls of politically correct agitprop trans pedantry, we're given a film that's just a whole lot of fun. What more could you ask for?
/m/honeydew	caebc415-ddcc-4864-9044-3bd6729fc586	3	Really odd, and heavy handed treatment of the story. And WHY would you insist on utterly bizarre and really irritating incidental music throughout. Not as creepy as it could have been, but oddly watchable. I can't make my mind up about this one.
/m/honeydew	caebc415-ddcc-4864-9044-3bd6729fc586	2	First 30 minutes were ok. Meh after that.
/m/honeydew	caebc415-ddcc-4864-9044-3bd6729fc586	3	May not be original in the premise of city folk stumbling in the backwoods, but Honeydew is an atmospheric & creepy trip into the bizarre.
/m/honeydew	caebc415-ddcc-4864-9044-3bd6729fc586	3	it's not a bad story, actually. idk what it was... creepy Karen stole the show & didn't mind the main girl actress, but for some reason i really hated the guy. not sure if it was his character or if it was the actor, but something about him just didn't really do it for me.
/m/honeydew	caebc415-ddcc-4864-9044-3bd6729fc586	1.5	Esse filme estava excelente em sua primeira parte,e depois foi apenas lento e nunca chegava a lugar nenhum e quando ele finalmente chegou há algum lugar,foi horrível executando os dois protagonistas como se não fossem nada,eu perdi muito tempo pra nada
/m/honeydew	caebc415-ddcc-4864-9044-3bd6729fc586	2	Young couple gets kicked outta their camping spot so that they end up at old lady Gunni's house.  But - Gunni likes to cook at end people after her old man lobotomizes them.
/m/honeydew	caebc415-ddcc-4864-9044-3bd6729fc586	0.5	Completely boring.  Also no character in the story is remotely relatable, and they all seem to do random, confusing things all throughout.  We finished it thinking there would be a payoff, but nothing.  No character growth, no story progression.  every shot was just a confusing closeup.  The lighting was pretty nice, that was about the best part.  This movie could have been a 5-10 min short and had the exact same character development and emotional tension.
/m/honeydew	caebc415-ddcc-4864-9044-3bd6729fc586	3	The first half is pretty awesome and the reason for the three stars. After that...not so much.
/m/honeydew	caebc415-ddcc-4864-9044-3bd6729fc586	1	Waste of time. If they trimmed this movie to 90 minutes I might be inclined to give it two stars, depending on what they cut out. My hunt for good horror/thriller/suspense continues.
/m/honeydew	caebc415-ddcc-4864-9044-3bd6729fc586	0.5	This movie was boring and unoriginal. Predictable. Gory and disgusting beyond need. Overall, awful and a waste of time.
/m/benny_loves_you	5d76cfe2-8d1e-4164-abf9-3adadb07e040	4.5	Crazy fun and agree with others -- watch later at night as it would be a great midnight movie.  It's humorous and guessing is labeled horror because there is a bit of gore (which isn't scary gore, but comedy gore).
/m/benny_loves_you	5d76cfe2-8d1e-4164-abf9-3adadb07e040	1.5	I'm not a fan of the campy horror genre in general, but Benny didn't illicit any laughs or scares for me.
/m/benny_loves_you	5d76cfe2-8d1e-4164-abf9-3adadb07e040	2	REALLY ridiculous... the film has impressive features such as the set, effects, and Karl Holt's insane multi-tasking. But I don't know if I'd necessarily call it "good" more so than "nutty". 4.3, C-
/m/benny_loves_you	5d76cfe2-8d1e-4164-abf9-3adadb07e040	3	Benny Loves You is a very silly but somewhat entertaining horror comedy. Look, it’s about a killer toy. You know what you’re getting into when you watch a film with this premise. Thankfully, the film is mostly self aware. While the humor doesn’t always work, it moves at a quick enough pace that keeps your attention. The kills are decent, and the film uses its low budget effectively. Overall, this was a fine watch. I wouldn’t say it’s particularly memorable but it’s enjoyable enough. If the premise interests you you’ll probably have fun with this.
/m/benny_loves_you	5d76cfe2-8d1e-4164-abf9-3adadb07e040	5	This movie is so freaking good LOLOLOL... All the kids that love their stuff toy too much needs to watch this lol.
/m/benny_loves_you	5d76cfe2-8d1e-4164-abf9-3adadb07e040	4	I actually loved this movie, it's funny, quirky and brutal. The CGI is bad but that helps with the stupidity of it. Don't go in expecting a masterpiece just enjoy this stupid as fuck ride.
/m/benny_loves_you	5d76cfe2-8d1e-4164-abf9-3adadb07e040	4.5	A sweet looking Benny talks with a high pitched voice right before he slashes your throat, is a clever and unique look at the toy market!!!!
/m/benny_loves_you	5d76cfe2-8d1e-4164-abf9-3adadb07e040	5	Really low expectations of this... its British horror comedy (of which only a few have been both well done and successful) and I expected it would be of such a low budget its effects would be dire. Having had an evening of pretty poor films (picked by the wife), she put this on... I cued my disappointment, ready to say well done on picking another turkey and settled down for a film I was sure would be turned off after 20 minutes. This film was excellent. I have since read it was done on a low budget. If I am completely honest... it doesn't tell. I have seen much much worse special effects on bigger productions.  It is funny, sarcastic and doesn't take itself too seriously.  Financed, written, edited (including effects) and Directed by the lead actor, he has done an amazing job. I truly enjoyed this and found myself laughing for most of the film.  I pray that the success of this film means that a sequel or off shoot is planned. Currently showing on Sky Cinema I advise you to grab the popcorn and enjoy this film for what it is..... brilliant  P.S..... I have read the "critics" reviews and the ones who have marked this down.... its easy to sit back in your chair and be a keyboard warrior.... make a film yourself and do what this guy has done and then get back to me
/m/benny_loves_you	5d76cfe2-8d1e-4164-abf9-3adadb07e040	1.5	Benny Loves You is a horror comedy about a scorned Elmo like toy going nuts.  It is written, directed, and staring Karl Holt.  Two of the three he excels at....unfortunately his acting is pretty bad and it drags the film down.  Had this starred someone with a bit more charisma this would be a hidden gem.  For fans of oddball gory horror (like Dead-alive) it is still worth tracking down (3 stars out of 5 for me) but for most audiences this will be a 1 1/2 star movie.
/m/benny_loves_you	5d76cfe2-8d1e-4164-abf9-3adadb07e040	5	Great movie!!!! Original, funny, violent, and adorable!
/m/when_today_ends	7803784f-a691-4bc0-a2a0-3a057d6ee54f	5	Michael Leoni directs When Today Ends, a painfully real, shocking film that covers a topic that seems to go unnoticed far too often: mental health. What a relevant movie for the time we are in. Mental health is such a pressing and significant topic in this day and age. Leoni and his team presents this issue in a modern way to help keep the attention of younger audiences. However, this movie is intended for all ages and generations and should be a learning experience moving forward. It showcases so many different scenarios that your coworker, friend, neighbor, daughter, son, etc. may be going through. You will walk away with a brand new perspective! great movie.
/m/when_today_ends	7803784f-a691-4bc0-a2a0-3a057d6ee54f	5	There is so much talk surrounding issues with youth and mental health, but When Today Ends shows the audience so much more creating an impact that "talk" alone cannot. The film can be heavy and extremely hard on the heart, but the emotion yet also numbness that this team captures needs to be shown.   Both parents and youth can benefit from seeing this film as it could help them to potentially better understand their friends, family, and other people around them. Even better, this film will help people grow and hopefully give them the insight to make a difference in the people around them.
/m/when_today_ends	7803784f-a691-4bc0-a2a0-3a057d6ee54f	4.5	Powerful film! Emotions run high as we walk through life with teens in our modern social media age. You never know when someone is hurting and when that hurt can become too much. Gripping film presenting difficult subject matter in a way that is relatable and opens the door to change. It is time for us to care for one another more deeply, especially our youth, this film is a great place to start. Watch this film!
/m/when_today_ends	7803784f-a691-4bc0-a2a0-3a057d6ee54f	5	This movie will take ahold of you in the first ten minutes and doesn't let go. It's so real and gut wrenching! You forget you're watching a scripted movie and really start to care for these lives whose souls just long to belong, somewhere, anywhere. But it definitely doesn't end that way.. You should Watch and see for yourself!
/m/when_today_ends	7803784f-a691-4bc0-a2a0-3a057d6ee54f	5	This amazing cast, writers, crew and director provide stronger awareness regarding depression and suicide!  Every parent…no, every human being should watch this.  Very moving and very eye-opening!
/m/when_today_ends	7803784f-a691-4bc0-a2a0-3a057d6ee54f	5	This is a movie that needs to be seen by every parent, every tween, every teen, everyone. It accurately portrays the pressure put upon our children from bullying, schools, parents, and their peers. With teen suicide rates escalating, we need to take a long look at society and do our part in preventing these tragedies from happening.
/m/when_today_ends	7803784f-a691-4bc0-a2a0-3a057d6ee54f	5	Mind blowing and life changing film about being a teen in the age of selfies. I loved it! I think every teenager should watch this and so should their parents! GREAT MOVIE!
/m/when_today_ends	7803784f-a691-4bc0-a2a0-3a057d6ee54f	5	This was extremely well done, and as a mother, it truly shook me to the core. I couldn't get it out of my head all weekend and it really made me think about the subtle and not so subtle ways we can either boost our children up or knock them down. The message delivered is powerful and thought provoking. Suicide is an epidemic in our country and this brings light to this important issue. A must see!
/m/when_today_ends	7803784f-a691-4bc0-a2a0-3a057d6ee54f	5	Another great film from Michael Leoni. A heartbreaking and intense depiction of teenage bullying, depression, and suicide. A must-watch for families with teenagers.
/m/when_today_ends	7803784f-a691-4bc0-a2a0-3a057d6ee54f	5	10/10 < 11/11. When I started to see the film for the first time, I found a character with whom I could identify, and tried to enjoy the film through its history, but as the film progressed I found that this is not about myself, because when I least expect it, my problems pass to the background and realize that someone close to me is reflected in the other characters and understand that that person could be having a hard time, serving as an exercise in empathy that regardless of the impeccable work of the actors, direction and the entire production team, this is a movie worth seeing more than once in addition to the majestically placed hidden "easter eggs".
/m/sound_of_violence	498886e1-4f9d-4599-9917-747393afe0c6	0.5	Absolutely crap, so boring
/m/sound_of_violence	498886e1-4f9d-4599-9917-747393afe0c6	3	Alright. Just watched and I am a bot orn. While there were many elements that I could enjoy like the premise of the story, the actresses, the visuals and the music, I did not like the translation of the story. It was very unnecessary gory instead of just violent and the visuals predominated the storytelling which is only a good thing if the story is strong and the visuals are stronger. In this case l, the story is meh and the visuals are ok.
/m/sound_of_violence	498886e1-4f9d-4599-9917-747393afe0c6	5	Wow! That ending is crazy. (Not a perfect film but that ending had me screaming so 5*)
/m/sound_of_violence	498886e1-4f9d-4599-9917-747393afe0c6	5	Original experimental fun!
/m/sound_of_violence	498886e1-4f9d-4599-9917-747393afe0c6	3	Had to update my review after sitting on it for a while. I recommend you watch for yourself as the movie isn't "HORRIBLE" like I thought before. It starts off great then devolves into mindless, gory nonsense that just isn't realistic, nor scary. However the acting is top notch, and at times it is very nerve wracking. But, the ending is just simply infuriating. And not in a good way…
/m/sound_of_violence	498886e1-4f9d-4599-9917-747393afe0c6	5	Completely original. Blew my mind!!
/m/the_retreat_2021	5d4066ae-2dbd-4b1b-a082-4df2ae31767e	2.5	Slow motion revenge gore with a twist - instead of killing random victims, these maniacs are live streaming homophobes.
/m/the_retreat_2021	5d4066ae-2dbd-4b1b-a082-4df2ae31767e	3	Decent and didn’t drag on 2.8. The one girl was definitely not committed to the relationship until after they almost got killed that was funny
/m/the_retreat_2021	5d4066ae-2dbd-4b1b-a082-4df2ae31767e	3.5	Nothing new here, but a well acted little nailbiter with good looking women kicking a**, something I'm always into.
/m/the_retreat_2021	5d4066ae-2dbd-4b1b-a082-4df2ae31767e	3.5	Very slow starting off and i also feel there should have been at least one more couple. Why cant the gay guys ever live? I feel you are making them look more weak than woman. Yes I am a woman but i feel give them some credit please. This movie could deff been done a lot better but it was ok for what its worth.
/m/the_retreat_2021	5d4066ae-2dbd-4b1b-a082-4df2ae31767e	5	I loved this film! Performances were amazing!
/m/the_retreat_2021	5d4066ae-2dbd-4b1b-a082-4df2ae31767e	2	It's becoming more frequent that I find myself hating a film that critics loved and loving a film that critics hate. The Retreat is barely watchable with its terrible editing and predictable outcome yet it receives mostly positive reviews. What has the world come to?
/m/the_retreat_2021	5d4066ae-2dbd-4b1b-a082-4df2ae31767e	0.5	Extreme pandering with no horror.
/m/the_retreat_2021	5d4066ae-2dbd-4b1b-a082-4df2ae31767e	5	It's an all gay horror movie with a queer writer and cast. It's revolutionary in ways I can't even begin to explain. Gay actors playing gay characters? Awesome! Lesbians being at the center of the film? Awesome! The prey becomes the predator? Even better. Give the film a chance. Watch it. It's worth it.
/m/the_retreat_2021	5d4066ae-2dbd-4b1b-a082-4df2ae31767e	5	Love this film.. justice
/m/north_hollywood	6d3c865b-e8a6-398b-9921-881b4c573019	3	Not so great.  I felt quite bored for nearly the whole movie.  The human emotions on display did not seem realistic to me.  The favorable ratings puzzle me.  I don't think this movie was at all compelling.  I certainly won't be watching it again.
/m/north_hollywood	6d3c865b-e8a6-398b-9921-881b4c573019	3	Strange but refreshing. I enjoyed the detour from the cliche writing styles of such a story. However refreshing that was it couldn't distract me from the Dwight Shrute song selections and the overly odd character interactions.  A good option if you've exhausted your watch list.
/m/north_hollywood	6d3c865b-e8a6-398b-9921-881b4c573019	1.5	I enjoy most everything with Vince Vaughn but this seemed poorly acted and had a low budget feel.
/m/north_hollywood	6d3c865b-e8a6-398b-9921-881b4c573019	5	Facts, this movies great love the soundtrack and Vince Vaughn needs to win some type of award he plays the best dad role ever!
/m/north_hollywood	6d3c865b-e8a6-398b-9921-881b4c573019	5	I grew up skateboarding in Los Angeles so this film really hits home for me. It's a story about losing and gaining friends, navigating complex relationships, ambition and what it means to be an adult. The performances all around were excellent, especially Ryder McLaughlin and Vince Vaughn, their scenes together really hit me in the feels. I can only assume this film was written by a skateboarder as they really nailed what it is to be an adolescent in our niche and sometimes toxic subculture (and if not, hats off because they really did their research). I highly recommend this film, it's substance transcends the generational gap and anyone will be able to enjoy this film, I never thought lightning would strike twice after Mid 90's but here we are.
/m/north_hollywood	6d3c865b-e8a6-398b-9921-881b4c573019	3.5	This film just worked 3.5
/m/north_hollywood	6d3c865b-e8a6-398b-9921-881b4c573019	5	North Hollywood audience goes far beyond the skater community. Beautiful coming of age story which highlights the struggles of committing to what you want to do in a world full of rules and forced suggestions. Loved it. Really happy to see it after such a long fight to get it released. Mikey Alfred is a great director and Ayinde Anderson is an actual game changer for cinema. Inspiring.
/m/north_hollywood	6d3c865b-e8a6-398b-9921-881b4c573019	4.5	During this depressing (no other adjective works as well) period known as the Lockdown, it seems I spend as much time dodging "wokerism" with as least as much skill and acuity as I spend dodging the virus.  Hollywood, for the most part, is one of those things that I've given up during this prolonged period of emotional/intellectual fasting (Lent?) that I've been putting myself through on the offhand chance that my own lack of substance somehow aided in the creation of this mythopoetic nightmare.       Hollywood has become as narcissistically obsessed with its own sense of virtue and self importance as those slick-haired, flatlander preachers who can go on for days about the glory of Christ without understanding said subject in the least. All the discussion about non-essential and essential workers seems to have lit a fire under its ass to the point that if an A list celebrity so much as takes the trash outside it has to be accompanied by a video lecture on the virtues of recycling. And they make it worse by pretending it's spontaneous act borne out compassion, as if their agent weren't pushing them out the door and the film crew, poised and waiting, was a part of the daily trash removal ritual.        It's gotten so bad, that almost nothing that Hollywood puts out nowadays interests me in the least, and I love going to movie theaters late at night and eating buttered popcorn.         I decided to rent the movie North Hollywood because: A) I was bored out of my mind and tired of reading serious books B) everything else Hollywood has made is either pretentious, lightweight, or repetitious C) I like coming of age stories because of their similarity to hero quests and the message they send that with proper guidance we are all capable of overcoming our problems  and D) I love movies that are set in the back streets and seldom seen areas of big cities like New York and Los Angeles. I didn't really expect much and at the beginning, I suspected that was exactly what I was going to get. The movie starts out slowly.          North Hollywood was made by the same people who made Mid90s, a skater flick about a young boy's search for meaning during the decade when pop culture exploded with all its flash and crass shallowness. I didn't like the movie when I first saw it and didn't really understand why. At first, I thought that it was like a lot of movies about being young and glorified aimless sex, drug use, an alcohol fueled excess, and was serving as a primer for existentialist thinking using the skater lifestyle as a method to convey the message that life has no meaning so it's up to us peons to color it up anyway we that we see fit, mainly by dulling our senses, tattooing everything in sight, and creating our own hieroglyphic understanding of the banality of life. I went back and watched it again though and came away with a different perspective. The second viewing forcefully reminding me of my own straying from the well trodden path being laid out for me by all my disinterested instructors, Sunday School teachers, and my tired, often distracted parents.             Like Stevie, the protagonist of the movie (ably played by a young Sunny Suljic), I also was searching for something else when I rejected my parent's lifestyle and whatever it was those well-intentioned adults were trying to tell me because it didn't more than a minute to  figure out that they were every bit as confused and frustrated by life as me.            It seems to me now, that the society of the 60s and 70s only wanted me to drink, screw, and get high. If I had to summarize the message of era as I lived it, that would be it. Eat, Drink, and have Sex because tomorrow you die. It didn't occur me until much, much later that were many other alternate meanings contained in the language and events of the times. Meanings that people who were much less confused than I held on to tightly and used to guide them forward and who therefore suffered a lot less than me and my friends.          It was the ending of the movie that changed my view the most. Stevie's mom walks into the waiting room at a hospital and sees his friends asleep and has to recognize that Stevie had managed, despite all the danger and false turns, to create a family unit out of nothing but a simple desire for acceptance.         North Hollywood takes up that theme and runs with it. It also offers up something that has been missing from Hollywood for quite sometime, a middle ground that is not a marshy, swampland  filled with radioactive alligators and soul sucking zombies, a middle where the conflicting characters can gingerly work their way back toward each other innately understanding that it this middle that needs more firmament and maybe even to be surrounded by a dike or two to hold back the storm waters that both mother nature and stupid sons-of-bitches unleash upon the rest of us.           The film juxtaposes a flashy modernity which represents the future against a backdrop of Leave It Beaver neighborhoods, parent/child conflict, and outdated social structures to reveal the truth that the past and the future are locked in a permanent embrace which produces the moments where we must face decisions about what should be timeless, what new thing is needed, and what  needs to be jettisoned or buried.  I haven't seen this in a movie for quite some time. Modern movies seem to be always about the blaming, the failing, and the rejecting with the writers and  movie makers not only intent on passing out judgement paid for by their corporate masters but also handing out worn-out platitudes covered with bling to make them seem original, and where pushing their belief systems is deemed more important than documenting life as it plays out in real time.          The film goes against a lot of the hogwash that Hollywood has shoved down our throats for such a long-assed  time, that our fathers aren't Al Bundy's or Homer Simpson's and never really were except in the poisonous minds of Hollywood scriptwriters, ass kissers, and producers; that Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein may share male genomes, but they were never perceived as father figures (Hollywood forgetting its own role in pushing Hugh Hefner and Larry Flint as culture heroes and the irony involved in shouting ME TOO from a stage at the Academy Awards where they passed out awards to the people who shaped that toxic culture in the first place (Thank you, Ricky Gervais), and that there is and always has been a solid middle ground where young and old not only can but must meet to learn from each other without the intersession of the high priests and priestesses of the hedonistic and power mad elites.         Michael (Ryder McLaughlin) the protagonist is a young man in search of a better future. In many respects, he is the continuation of the Stevie character of Mid90s. He wants to be professional skater and faces a lot of hard choices because of this dream. His father doesn't see skating as a valid career choice and urges him to find something more substantial and practical. He's lucky because he does have talent, and the talent brings him to the attention of people who have followed the career path successfully. This however creates problems with what to do about friends who are less driven to succeed and are more into skating for the simple pleasures and the distractions. This is also a throwback thematically. My generation coined the phrase Go With the Flow back in the 60s and society has suffered from it ever since It is more than somewhat refreshing to see something that points out that going with the flow usually carries one downward to the lowest levels of existence. Actor Angus Cloud powerfully portrays Walker a character who serves as the very embodiment of a hedonistic life style.           Vince Vaughn plays the father, and I think it is one of his best performances. There is a scene at the end that made me tear up at the recognition of the conversations that my father and I never had. My dad was a mechanic, a Dust Bowl Okie, and a working class Renaissance figure capable of building a house or taking a car apart and putting it back together. I, on the other hand, was born to read. It was always in books that soothed my anxieties and searched for truth and meaning. I've gotten to point where I realize that my Dad's knowledge of electricity and mechanical systems would have greatly enhanced my understanding of life in general, and all I ever had to do was ask him a question. He would have answered not only joyfully, but with every ounce of passion that he had in him, and it would have allowed me to share some of the things I learned from reading.        I bought my dad a nice Fender acoustic guitar on his birthday for helping me get through college. It took his breath away when he pulled it out of the case. This movie made me realize that asking him a few simple questions would have done so much more.

/m/north_hollywood	6d3c865b-e8a6-398b-9921-881b4c573019	4.5	Asa sk8r I thought it was dope. The camera direction was excellent. The long shots were refreshing. The cinématography was excellent. The acting was great and well cast. I like any movie with skateboards so I may have been extra impressed.
/m/fear_2021	872417bf-96a6-3b4c-bda3-06fc2b88c47b	5	Well acted and beautifully shot, this is a fresh injection into the the sub horror genre of zombies. I think we are all getting used to the procedural zombie movie/tv show but this is a refreshing look at it.
/m/fear_2021	872417bf-96a6-3b4c-bda3-06fc2b88c47b	5	Hooks you right from the start, great character depth and development. You can really get a feel of the environment and tension throughout the film. The acting was strong and the action scenes completely deliver! Was a great movie to watch on a Friday night
/m/fear_2021	872417bf-96a6-3b4c-bda3-06fc2b88c47b	1.5	The most ridiculous dialogue, and some woeful acting by the younger members of the cast in particular make for a really dull film. Don't bother.
/m/fear_2021	872417bf-96a6-3b4c-bda3-06fc2b88c47b	2.5	F.E.A.R. means Forget Everything and Run. I'm sure some lazier critics will use that in their headline for their review, but let's see what this is really all about.  Directed by Geoff Reisner and Jason Tobias (who also wrote the film and appears as Ethan), this is the story of a young family whose supplies have been stolen by some bandits. However, when a deadly pathogen is released into the atmosphere, they must all work together to survive.    A pandemic has resulted in most of the Pacific Northwest being walled off by the government. That's where the Allister family is trapped, including their young daughter, who is kept alive through an improvised medical device. There are also zombies that have been created by the disease that are roaming the first and last five minutes of this movie.  This feels a lot like A Quiet Place, which is not a bad movie to be inspired by, in that this is a human drama with some horror and science fiction elements surrounding it. The cast is talented and gives some strong performances. If only the script worked as hard as they did to be a little more unique. Yet all in all, not all that bad of a time was had by all (except those, you know, menaced by the zombies and winter weather).
/m/fear_2021	872417bf-96a6-3b4c-bda3-06fc2b88c47b	5	An interesting take on a post-apocalyptic COVID type of world seen through the eyes of a young family that takes on troublesome zombies & humans alike.  A good watch the whole way through with impressive acting.  Enjoyed it very much!
/m/a_perfect_enemy	f65b9554-2939-4084-90e1-fb9d3c2ca8bf	4	Although it is clear from the start that this is a psychological drama that would pull some viewers into detective work, the movie was successful in drawing me into the mystery, first of nature of the relationship of the two characters, and then deciphering the actual events before the plotline's narrative revealed those events, although there was always the suspicion that memories presented were false memories or intentionally misrepresented memories. I thought the acting was solid, the plot flowed smoothly albeit slowly a few times, and enough questions remained unanswered to entice me to visit a few review sites for clarification or explanation.
/m/a_perfect_enemy	f65b9554-2939-4084-90e1-fb9d3c2ca8bf	3.5	This film deserves credit for being finally a unique fearless plotline Stick with this one an you will be glad you did artistic foreign director movie with plenty of twist and turns and a decent end all in all
/m/a_perfect_enemy	f65b9554-2939-4084-90e1-fb9d3c2ca8bf	0.5	This movie was so boring. I kept waiting for something compelling. But it never happened. This is a good example of why you can't trust critic scores.
/m/a_perfect_enemy	f65b9554-2939-4084-90e1-fb9d3c2ca8bf	1.5	Good acting and shot well on a low budget, but the ending...yuk! Calling it unsatisfying is being nice. And I usually like twist endings... Well, at least it was only 90 minutes. These "it was all in their head" movies drive me crazy. And Texel Textor... Why oh why that name? And then keep repeating it as nauseum....
/m/a_perfect_enemy	f65b9554-2939-4084-90e1-fb9d3c2ca8bf	3	It is a psychological drama, a sexually frustrated, smart architect who killed his wife 20 years ago and dumped her body in construction site at the airport returns to Paris. Twenty years seem to have brought him fame and recognition ; however, his guilty conscience gives birth to a teenage girl, it is not clear whether she exists in his fantasy alone or is a real woman but her cryptic stories that start with a delayed flight pull him back to school days and thereafter of jealousy, greed and hunger to succeed.  Our protagonist initially resists hearing the stories from his fantasy daughter that would have been a real 20 years youth had he not killed his wife; he eventually manages to dump her alive in the same material that was used to bury his wife's body.  Those who understand the human psychology of murderers, white collar criminals shall find this movie based on a novel interesting; it is not perfect but successfully presents a limited picture of reality blurred into fantasy. Athena Strates  with the strange yet meaningful name of Texel Textor,  is perfect as a mysterious teen.
/m/a_perfect_enemy	f65b9554-2939-4084-90e1-fb9d3c2ca8bf	0.5	Horrible movie, save your money.  The commercial had more effort then the film and writing/development of the characters. Worst movie
/m/a_perfect_enemy	f65b9554-2939-4084-90e1-fb9d3c2ca8bf	4.5	One of the better movies I’ve seen this year. Artistically illustrated and a few twists to boot. The only reason I didn’t give this five stars is because I was able to predict the outcome- but still happy with how it was done.
/m/a_perfect_enemy	f65b9554-2939-4084-90e1-fb9d3c2ca8bf	3	It's well done all the way around, but I grow fatigued of the insane person hallucinating the whole thing. How many times do we have to see this device? A thousand?
/m/a_perfect_enemy	f65b9554-2939-4084-90e1-fb9d3c2ca8bf	3.5	There were enough Easter eggs to indicate the ultimate exposure of the central character's state of mind and the closure of this very well structured psychological thriller. was well worth waiting for! Quote: "Tell a lie enough times and it becomes the truth" it seems to have worked well for Trump over the past 4 years!
/m/a_perfect_enemy	f65b9554-2939-4084-90e1-fb9d3c2ca8bf	5	I really enjoyed this movie! It kept me on my toes wondering what happened next! Absolutely recommend!!
/m/rogue_hostage	8b95406e-7da2-48c4-803b-62c4a362d831	1.5	Inside a CQB action movie, its' very difficult to make a good one. The last time low mark example recently was the "Trauma Center". But this one is even worse...... Finally, I don't know the robber is going for money or going for revenge...... haha.
/m/rogue_hostage	8b95406e-7da2-48c4-803b-62c4a362d831	0.5	It's worst movie that I saw.
/m/rogue_hostage	8b95406e-7da2-48c4-803b-62c4a362d831	1	1 out of 5 stars. Horrible and dumb. Dumb plot. Action is horrible. Acting is tedious. Script is filled with dumb characters and just flat out terrible.
/m/rogue_hostage	8b95406e-7da2-48c4-803b-62c4a362d831	0.5	Absolutely the worst film I've ever watched. If you're thinking of watching this, don't. Save that hour and a half to do something more productive. Like staring into space. Seemed like it was directed by a 12 year old with the budget of my brother's pocket money.
/m/rogue_hostage	8b95406e-7da2-48c4-803b-62c4a362d831	1	Absolutely unwatchable garbage. The plot is nonsense, and the acting is cringeworthy. I couldn't finish it, and I will watch anything.
/m/rogue_hostage	8b95406e-7da2-48c4-803b-62c4a362d831	3	It's okay. It's well-paced. The main character is well-acted, though afflicted with the Hollywood PTSD trope. The characters are mostly caricatures. And the messaging is heavy handed, with every caucasian male being morally corrupt or a bad guy.
/m/rogue_hostage	8b95406e-7da2-48c4-803b-62c4a362d831	0.5	Laughably bad but at least I laughed.
/m/rogue_hostage	8b95406e-7da2-48c4-803b-62c4a362d831	0.5	Terrible. Make it stop
/m/rogue_hostage	8b95406e-7da2-48c4-803b-62c4a362d831	0.5	Whoever directed this movie wasted 1 hour & 33 minutes of my life. Unnecessary music in between scenes, awful acting and to make matters worse, it was filmed with an Android phone...
/m/rogue_hostage	8b95406e-7da2-48c4-803b-62c4a362d831	0.5	ugh. with that amazing cast it seems that someone made this movie on their iPhone 5. It doesn't even look like a movie and the "acting", yikes.
/m/death_in_texas	970bcef0-d655-3f87-9e53-dc1215fcfb24	1.5	Some movies stretch your credulity, but they usually don't take themselves seriously. Not this one. Its apparently well intentioned sentimentalism is totally eclipsed by its unbelievable plot. The script appears to have been written by a 12 year-old, the dialogue is laugh-out-loud stupid, and the acting is irrelevant because the actors are given so little to work with. It amazes me that movies like this actually get produced and filmed.  The story is simple and cliched: A man is released from a Texas prison (his appearance before the parole board is the first clue that you're in for a stupid fest). He goes to his mother's house and gets into a fight with her boyfriend. He discovers that she has liver disease and is way down the list for a transplant. He starts robbing drug dealers to raise $160,000 for a black market liver across the border in Mexico. There's much more, but it's so ludicrous, I won't bother detailing it.  Ronnie Gene Blevins plays Billy the ex-con. Laura Flynn Boyle plays his mother. Bruce Dern plays the big time dope dealer. All of these actors are good at their craft, but the script is so lame, they can't do anything to salvage this mess.  I watched it to the end (I usually do, just in case a bad movie somehow magically redeems itself), but there was no hope. The film continues inexorably downhill until it reaches a conclusion that is so preposterous, you'll either be slapping yourself or throwing a brick at your screen. Save yourself the self-inflicted injury or damage to your TV and avoid this one. You've been warned. You're welcome.
/m/death_in_texas	970bcef0-d655-3f87-9e53-dc1215fcfb24	3	Great story, terrible execution, then subtract more stars for casting Bruce Dern. Seriously, who's idea was it to cast Dern as some big rich drug lord/gangster? The guy looks and sounds like a drunk bum. I was cringing every time the camera was on him and his straggly hair, and started talking like a drunk. He may have worked in a comedy version of this story. Worst casting decision I've ever seen; that casting agent needs to change careers. Then you have Ronnie Gene Blevins all monotonic and straight faced, looking like he was bored and only there for the paycheck. I struggled to stay awake when most of the focus was on him. The only stand-out and convincing performances were by Lara Flynn Boyle, Stephen Lang and Cher Cosenza.  The directing by novice writer and director Scott Windhauser wasn't too bad for a newb, and although the stories concept was amazing, the execution was less desirable. There were many plot and technical issues. Some dialogue was cheesy and/or unnecessary. It lacked any type of action. Why just show flashes of him and the bouncer? Some nice exciting action would've been refreshing to give the audience someone to route for - and struggle less staying awake. The pacing needed improvement, as the 101 min runtime felt much longer. The score was actually not bad for a B-film, but I had some issues with the sound, as some dialogue sounded muffled and illegible. It's a shame, because this story had lots of potential, had it been cast properly with some tweaks to the screenplay. So never mind all the bogus high reviews, it's a generous 6/10 from me.
/m/death_in_texas	970bcef0-d655-3f87-9e53-dc1215fcfb24	4	The bad guy was bad, but turned it to be a good dude. The other bad guys were just bad! You have to pay attention at the beginning to catch all the twists that are coming your way (or lay off the Ranch Waters before the movie!)  Story line is solid. Will watch again and recommend to friends but not family.
/m/death_in_texas	970bcef0-d655-3f87-9e53-dc1215fcfb24	3.5	Death in Texas is that rare find of a thought provoking action film. It has all the earmarks of a gritty crime story but manages to intertwine the action with a drama about the human dilemmas of choice, relationships and the gray area of real life, not Hollywood, morality. Independent movies will often cast a name actor, usually well past their prime, for a cameo appearance to help get the film made and marketed. Death in Texas was able to attract a full roster of multiple long-time actors with skills well intact and support them with solid up and coming talent, a clever script and strong directing to create a story that keeps you entertained, on edge and pondering the underlying themes well after you've paused the credits to find the names & filmographies of all the new and familiar faces.
/m/death_in_texas	970bcef0-d655-3f87-9e53-dc1215fcfb24	4	At first glance, it would be easy to mistake this for just another movie about cops, criminals, drugs, and corruption on the U. S. - Mexican border. It's more than that. It starts off largely alternating between two almost completely separate storylines. Then those story lines merge or more accurately collide and the movie really starts hitting its mark all the way to its finish. So, yes there are cops, criminals, drugs, and corruption in this movie. But in the end its really more about family and redemption.  The cast was excellent. I particularly enjoyed the performances by Laura Flynn Boyle and Ronnie Blevins.
/m/death_in_texas	970bcef0-d655-3f87-9e53-dc1215fcfb24	5	I loved this film. The cinematography and the acting was incredible. I was invested in the story and enjoyed every minute of it even the twist at the end. Watch is and find out for yourself. Ronnie Gene Blevins was great in the lead role and Mike Foy and Stephen Lang were my other favorites in the film.
/m/death_in_texas	970bcef0-d655-3f87-9e53-dc1215fcfb24	5	What a fun ride! Great cast! Explosive action and edgy characters set against a moral struggle to do one last good thing before your time is up. Death in Texas is as hot as the pico at the cantina, so if you're gonna take a shot, make it a double.
/m/death_in_texas	970bcef0-d655-3f87-9e53-dc1215fcfb24	5	Amazing flick! Boyle, Lang, and Blevins knock the cover off the ball! Must see for 2021!!
/m/death_in_texas	970bcef0-d655-3f87-9e53-dc1215fcfb24	5	The movie was amazing!  The cast all did an awesome job at telling the story. I couldn't be more in love with it. The story that Scott Windhauser was able to tell was heartwarming. The evil that was described truly hits home. There are so many tough decisions we have to face daily. This shows how someone might be dealing with those decisions, and the implications thereof. But more importantly what we are willing to do for those we love.
/m/death_in_texas	970bcef0-d655-3f87-9e53-dc1215fcfb24	5	Enjoyed it very much. All the actors did a fantastic job. Great unexpected twist  towards the end.
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	0.5	This movie was so bad I feel terrible for watching it with other people. The story line sucked. I still never learned what was going on. No motives are ever explained. Even the audio control of this movie sucks. Please save you time and scroll past this one.
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	0.5	Worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I feel robbed of time. I am mad at the director, and I feel bad for the actors. Do not watch this movie.
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	1	When you see the bad reviews, believe them, don't watch it's absolutely horrendous.
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	2	With that many great actors you would think this would be a good movie.  Not.  Stupid plot and story.   The background music was so horrible that you could hardly watch some of the scenes.   What happened to the good old gangster movies?  So disappointed in this movie.  It had great potential but it just did not have any legs.
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	4	Well shot and well performed. Worth your time.
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	0.5	Atrocious, lacks any sense of a cohesive anything, just jarring vignettes of random people that do nothing to move this story anywhere.  The entire film is built around a  stolen idea that is a sub-plot in The Godfather #3, (death by cannoli) that the film makers decided to turn this into a painfully dull 90 minutes of absolutely terrible film making, is nowhere near as odd as the fact that no one brought this up as a inspiringly bad idea. Theres so much wrong with this film I can't think of anything good, oh its only 90 minutes, so theres that!
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	4.5	Really good mob film with lots of familiar faces from the Sopranos. Must watch.
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	1	Screaming out Italian mobster clichés, The Birthday Cake puts a solid cast of names with barely anything to do than act like third rate gangsters. Its kinda sad and really dull to get though. Forget about it !!!
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	0.5	This was just terrible,  This film felt like it was hatched at 3 in the morning drunk, like heah wouldn't this be a great idea for a  film?  Uh no it would not.   More holes in the plot then yes swiss cheese.   I guess people forget Scorcese grew up in LITTLE ITALY with actual gangsters, he knows them thats part of why his films about them are so spot on.  These people dont know mobsters and dont know Brooklyn, at all,  what possible neighborhood could this be? are they kidding? have they been to Brooklyn, and we dont mean Williamsburg, honestly could go on and on, but just kinda sad to have this cast and produce this film.  who do I call for my money back!!!!!!
/m/the_birthday_cake	9e9db3d0-3798-3bab-8442-14d5b88e9c57	5	The depiction of culture was crisp and stylishly expressed, topped with witty dialogue. In the timeframe of just one day, the movie naturally demonstrates the layers and rite of passage of the main character, Gio, through the unfolding of his personality alongside his subtly unknown, yet so important role in the plot.   Though many actors are well-known, I haven't seen them play roles like the ones in "The Birthday Cake," which felt refreshing and tasteful as a viewer. But on top of the individual cast members, it also was the eclectic combination of the cast that felt original and memorable. The incredible cast came together in ways I haven't seen and other films, with a special harmonious synergy.   The film shines through the details. It pulls you in, and makes the storytelling the center of why this movie is a high recommendation in my book.
/m/captive_2020	3b934116-c3c3-3cfe-bf65-238eabf9792c	1.5	There is no doubt in my mind that even the weakest teenage female, both mentally and physically, could have escaped such an unbalanced and inept captor within days. Her escape attempts were laughable and unrealistic.
/m/captive_2020	3b934116-c3c3-3cfe-bf65-238eabf9792c	0.5	Extremely disappointing. There must have been very few reviews when me and my brother saw the meter at 100%. It was slow and the "twist" wasn't all that great.
/m/captive_2020	3b934116-c3c3-3cfe-bf65-238eabf9792c	3.5	Captive, formerly titled Katherine's Lullaby, is a slow-burn horror/thriller from skilled writer/director Savvas Christou. Teenage runaway Lily (Tori Kostic), fleeing her abusive father, gets kidnapped and held against her will by a delusional older man (William Kircher) convinced she's actually his daughter. In order to survive, Lily must play pretend for as long as it takes. A limited cast and setting keeps the action small-scale, working to the benefit of the unnerving and intimate narrative.

/m/untitled_horror_movie	69ef60d4-cf22-369a-a65a-21d7132b6eff	3	It doesn't provide anything revolutionary to the found footage styled horror genre, but Untitled Horror Movie implements contemporary technology to the mix far better than most and can be quite engaging when it needs to be. It's blend of satire doesn't always hit  but usually has the intended effect.
/m/untitled_horror_movie	69ef60d4-cf22-369a-a65a-21d7132b6eff	3.5	Untitled Horror Movie executes its creative plot in the best way without taking itself too seriously resulting in a really entertaining horror flick.
/m/untitled_horror_movie	69ef60d4-cf22-369a-a65a-21d7132b6eff	5	I laughed in a completely good way!! There was a spook factor as well as, but the meta and dark comedy was to die for
/m/untitled_horror_movie	69ef60d4-cf22-369a-a65a-21d7132b6eff	0.5	No horror, no comedy
/m/untitled_horror_movie	69ef60d4-cf22-369a-a65a-21d7132b6eff	3.5	Enjoyable to watch thanks to a cast seemingly having a lot of fun shooting this horror comedy with an interesting meta premise. The build up is promising but there is a lte down on the scary side, even more when coming out after Host that was pretty horrific in the same genre of movie. Still pretty recommendable.
/m/untitled_horror_movie	69ef60d4-cf22-369a-a65a-21d7132b6eff	5	Must watch with friends. Such an amazing cast with great comedic timing and chemistry while also providing suspenseful scares. Loved it.
/m/untitled_horror_movie	69ef60d4-cf22-369a-a65a-21d7132b6eff	5	I loved seeing a combination of so many great actors I knew from individual projects they have done. Very fun. Also amazing, that they managed to do all that on their own. So much more work, but I think/hope it was as rewarding for them as it seems to have been. Big props to everyone! Congratulations guys, you did something great and new and fun. The money was witty, hilarious, creepy and interesting.
/m/untitled_horror_movie	69ef60d4-cf22-369a-a65a-21d7132b6eff	4.5	The acting was SO good. And the fact that they managed to film, edit, put make-up, manage lighting, etc., all by themselves is applause-worthy. Someone hand them some awards, right now!
/m/untitled_horror_movie	69ef60d4-cf22-369a-a65a-21d7132b6eff	5	This movie is innovative and fresh af! I wasnt sure if I would like it at first but it grew on me and after that it just got better & better.
/m/untitled_horror_movie	69ef60d4-cf22-369a-a65a-21d7132b6eff	5	This movie is such a fun way of showing how horror can be made. Luke did an amazing job writing this and all of the actors did great as their characters. They really showed a great start of a story in 1.5 hours all filmed from their own homes. I can't wait to see what they have in store for us for the sequel!
/m/killer_concept	5f018e44-a8d1-3509-86d4-d43c0d644a8a	5	Great movie, mixing between dark fantasies of one person and the reality of others. Was fun and thrilling!
/m/killer_concept	5f018e44-a8d1-3509-86d4-d43c0d644a8a	4	I really enjoyed this film. This one kept me on the edge of my seat.
/m/killer_concept	5f018e44-a8d1-3509-86d4-d43c0d644a8a	4	Not only does Killer Concept offer a unique take on its subject matter, but it punches well above its indie filmmaking weight in terms of performances and production values. Overall, an enjoyable movie that delivers the familiar and the unexpected in the right dose.
/m/killer_concept	5f018e44-a8d1-3509-86d4-d43c0d644a8a	5	Loved this movie! I just want to know what happens next? Left me hanging, but that's ok... hopefully, there's a follow-up!
/m/killer_concept	5f018e44-a8d1-3509-86d4-d43c0d644a8a	4	Killer Concept is well a Killer Concept! This movie combines 2 of my favorite things. Horror movies and movies about making/writing movies. The concept was tons of fun and felt very fresh. I enjoyed the balancing of the tone. The "fake" horror movie we get to watch in there they're while they explain there ideas to each other is a great visual idea. I thought he film was very well paced, never over stays its welcome and had some great lighting. Overall a surprisingly well made and entertaining  indie film. I  definitely recommend it!
/m/killer_concept	5f018e44-a8d1-3509-86d4-d43c0d644a8a	3.5	I enjoy scary films. No, let me clarify. Good scary films. And they are hard to come by, that's for sure. There are only a handful that are released every year that could be considered good. And if you happen to be a hard-to-please horror aficionado, there are only a handful every DECADE that could be considered good. So any time a fresh idea for these types of films arrives online, I'm happy to watch. Killer Concept is a fun little jaunt into the genre, and for the most part, I enjoyed this one. I thought the lead actress did an especially fine job too. My only issue with Killer Concept is that the identity of the killer was revealed far too soon, deflating some of the suspense that Director Glenn Payne may have achieved otherwise. A small, but significant in the film's overall arc. That said, this is a well-done indie that recalls "Tales from the Dark Side" and shows that it doesn't take an enormous budget to make an effective story come to life. 3.5/5
/m/killer_concept	5f018e44-a8d1-3509-86d4-d43c0d644a8a	4	Ideas are gold in film: if not fully fleshed out, a filmmaker is often left with empty characters and dull plot – the kiss of death, especially in horror. Killer Concept, from director / star Glenn Payne, explores the often-painful process of developing a story, centring on three creatives writing a horror movie based on a killer who is still on the loose. A dialogue-heavy horror comedy with a fantastic cast that recalls such recent hits as Scare Me and The Oak Room, Killer Concept proves that you really can hold a viewer’s attention with only a, well…killer concept.
/m/killer_concept	5f018e44-a8d1-3509-86d4-d43c0d644a8a	5	Anyone that creates any form of art can tell you that the creative process to reach a final product can be daunting to say the least. Even more so when the project is based on "real" events and doesn't yet have an ending. In the Deadleaf Productions thriller comedy "Killer Concept," written by Casey Dillard and directed by Glenn Payne, that challenge takes on a life of its own and leaves the audience screaming for the protagonists to realize what's going on before it's too late.  In this captivating story, we find Seth, Holly, and Mark neck deep in their attempt to write a movie chronicling the murders currently being committed in their own town. Creative differences flair with Seth (Coley Bryant) and Holly (Casey Dillard). Seth wants blood, gore, and to give the audience what he thinks they want. Holly has the desire to stay true to the events laid out in front of them and doesn't want to glorify what the murderer is doing. Then there's Mark (Glenn Payne), who we find out pretty early on has a closer connection to the victims than either Seth or Holly could have ever dreamed. A tie that leads all three characters down a suspenseful road and crashes into the heart stopping, jaw dropping conclusion. There's no question that Dillard has, once again, written a masterpiece.  The riveting storyline to this indie film isn't it's only highlight. Not by a long shot. The production value is undoubtedly something to rave about. With the flawless lighting, camera angles, and close-ups that draw the viewer so far into the characters' world it feels like one were sitting and contributing to their conversations mixed with locations and props that never felt anything less than 100% organic, to find out the budget was less than $1,000 is nothing short of mind boggling. It is evident the small crew that built this film from start to finish put their heart and souls into it in order to bring their fans something truly incredible.  Glenn Payne, Casey Dillard, and Coley Bryant add yet another level to the film with their chemistry and acting skill. The three play off each other effortlessly and have a way of reaching out to the audience that simultaneously links you to each of their characters. Bryant delivers as the obnoxious and eager Seth. Dillard packs a punch with the blunt and passionate Holly. However, it's Payne who leaves the viewer nothing short of breathless with his portrayal of the meek, yet deadly, Mark. Glenn delves into the mind of a killer, peeling back layers and revealing raw emotions that brings a whole new meaning to the phrase, "sympathy for the devil."
/m/the_spongebob_movie_sponge_on_the_run	baf1b66c-ef26-3771-9aff-58a5aeecfd25	1.5	The movie isn't nearly as fun or even necessary [especially in comparison to] Spongebob movie 1 & 2, and I felt at times like the movie was more so just trying to promote Kamp Koral. 3.0/10
/m/the_spongebob_movie_sponge_on_the_run	baf1b66c-ef26-3771-9aff-58a5aeecfd25	1.5	This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The voice acting is nothing compared to some of the episodes and the entire movie is extremely boring. The animation is terrible and the singing is so annoying. The plot had barely anything to it and the ending wasn't good at all. The only thing I liked about this movie were the characters because it really delves deep into how everyone became friends and how the childhood was. Other than that I do not recommend because this is horrible.
/m/the_spongebob_movie_sponge_on_the_run	baf1b66c-ef26-3771-9aff-58a5aeecfd25	2.5	This is honestly the weakest of the SpongeBob trilogy. I was really excited seeing SpongeBob get a third movie which took forever to come out in the USA. Sponge on the Run is pretty charming and most of the returning characters from the show have great character in the movie, even Patrick seems to have a nice fix to his character knowing how awfully mean he became in the SpongeBob series during this current era. But the adventure is really underwhelming and pretty dehydrated. Not much really happens in this movie other than SpongeBob and Patrick's quest to find Gary. First of all, this has been done before in a SpongeBob special being "Have You Seen This Snail?" which was honestly better than this movie. There's barely any good jokes, the live-action scenes with Keanu Reeves and Snoop Dogg was honestly boring, King Poseidon's character makes no sense who is basically a child friendly downgrade of King Neptune from the first movie, and worst of all the Kamp Koral scenes made this movie feel like an advertisement to the upcoming spin-off Kamp Koral. Which by the way sets a noticeable continuity error with SpongeBob meeting Sandy as seen in the pilot episode of the series "Tea at the Treedome". If there's anything more to compliment it's the animation, the voice acting, and the musical number near the end. The animation isn't top notch but I did find the style creative for a CGI SpongeBob movie, only thing that bothered me is it look liked stop-motion at times. This movie isn't Nickelodeon's worst, but for SpongeBob it barely works at all. I feel like since Stephen Hillenburg passed away who worked on the other two movies beforehand, the magic was all gone even for this.
/m/the_spongebob_movie_sponge_on_the_run	baf1b66c-ef26-3771-9aff-58a5aeecfd25	5	The film is a nice way to tribute Stephen Hillenburg as like the first movie it has fresh jokes,great voice acting and new characters like King Poseidon and Sage for example and it also feel's like it barrows elements from South Park Bigger,Longer and Uncut as songs like Secret To The Formula and How We Do for example songs that are both catchy and beautiful and it is fun for the whole family to watch with lot's of comedy and some heart like in the flashback scene or when Mr Krabs and Plankton talk to each other of example.
/m/the_spongebob_movie_sponge_on_the_run	baf1b66c-ef26-3771-9aff-58a5aeecfd25	5	Every time I watch Spongebob Squarepants on Nickelodeon, I sometimes act like a nine-year-old and have a really good time. This movie is no different. THE SPONGEBOB MOVIE: SPONGE ON THE RUN had me glued to the screen like a nine-year-old magnet.
/m/the_spongebob_movie_sponge_on_the_run	baf1b66c-ef26-3771-9aff-58a5aeecfd25	4.5	The best SpongeBob film since the first. What it lacks in the original animation of Spongebob it makes up for with it's beautiful settings, adventure, and comedy. It may not be a film to watch while your sad cause it shows crying a bit much, but it is a truly fun film. Also something with Plankton here is surprising and has me questioning and 1 or two things don't make sense about his doing or doings in the film but I won't spoil it. 4 and a half out of 5.
/m/the_spongebob_movie_sponge_on_the_run	baf1b66c-ef26-3771-9aff-58a5aeecfd25	3.5	Once again, have not watched the show itself only the movies. I really liked the previous two I've seen, this one is pretty good too but the others were better. Keanu Reeves shows up as a "sage" and Danny Trejo as some demon from hell named El Diablo(very random). Other than that it's about SpongeBob looking for his kidnapped pet snail, which isn't the most thrilling of plots but well.. it is a cartoon movie after all.
/m/the_spongebob_movie_sponge_on_the_run	baf1b66c-ef26-3771-9aff-58a5aeecfd25	0.5	I was so excited about this movie but then let down I had high expectations but none of them happened I tried to like it but the plot made no sense at all I give this movie a 1-10 for how bad it was
/m/the_spongebob_movie_sponge_on_the_run	baf1b66c-ef26-3771-9aff-58a5aeecfd25	4	OMG I really like the 3D version in this Spongebob movie. Funny, with a touching ending, how Squidwart who really hates Spongebob finally admits their friendship. This is a heartwarming film.
/m/the_spongebob_movie_sponge_on_the_run	baf1b66c-ef26-3771-9aff-58a5aeecfd25	5	👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
/m/you_go_to_my_head	478cb48e-bee2-3351-ab51-1cff3caf8ef4	5	Cinema and Architecture: "You Go To My Head" deserves to be nominated for an architecture award. The film's protagonist is an architect, played by Serb actor Svetozar Cvetkovic. He knows the part well; he already interpreted the role of an architect in two Yugoslavian feature films. The movie's principal setting is the very beautiful, widely-published Fobe House in Marrakech (Morocco), designed by French architect Guilhem Eustache. The screenplay calls to mind an architecture project as well (blank 'white' sheet, challenging design, construction, delays, more construction, anticipation...). Filmmaker Dimitri de Clercq creates shots, atmospheres, lighting and colors that reminded me of Jean-Luc Godard's "Le mépris" ("Contempt"). The narrative could be taken from a story by Alberto Moravia. In my opinion, "You Go To My Head" is an absolute must-see for architects and lovers of architecture alike.
/m/you_go_to_my_head	478cb48e-bee2-3351-ab51-1cff3caf8ef4	4	It is all too easy to let your identity be subsumed by that of your partner, at which point you merely perform as someone's "significant other." The phrase is an ominous one, implying the fragmentation of personhood through the very act of coupling. An ironic experiment that rivals the equally twisted and lavish Phantom Thread. Composer Hacène Larbi's score understands the raw expressive potential of atonality.
/m/you_go_to_my_head	478cb48e-bee2-3351-ab51-1cff3caf8ef4	5	Great experience https://propliners.in
/m/you_go_to_my_head	478cb48e-bee2-3351-ab51-1cff3caf8ef4	4	Obsession and desire in the Sahara. If you liked Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo," you'll love this film. It is a tale of obsession and desire set in Morocco. A lonely architect finds a beautiful woman stumbling through the desert. She is the perfect prey for the man, who, like the James Stewart character in Vertigo, is imperfect and flawed. I never worried about the woman's physical safety–for our anti-hero is racked with guilt, but he can't stop himself from deceiving the woman who remembers nothing and has become like a child again. The ending is wonderfully ambiguous--will he be rewarded or punished? Gorgeous cinematography paints the landscape and architecture in parched whites and golds.
/m/you_go_to_my_head	478cb48e-bee2-3351-ab51-1cff3caf8ef4	4.5	[CRÍTICA | PELI o MANTA | EMIFF] YOU GO TO MY HEAD: En la mente, un desierto - You Go to My Head era una de las propuestas que con más ansia esperábamos ver en el Evolution! Mallorca International Film Festival. Un filme sin fecha de estreno en España y que podrá verse este viernes (23/11/2018) en Madrid. Será en el FICARQ, el festival internacional de cine y arquitectura. Se trata de la primera película realizada por Dimitri de Clercq, director belga de extensa labor como productor cinematográfico. Su sensibilidad y bagaje cinéfilo no dejan de traslucirse en su filme. La cinta cuenta la historia de Dafne (Delfine Bafort), una chica que pierde la memoria tras un accidente de coche en el desierto y en el que su acompañante muere. Jake (Svetozar Cvetković), un solitario arquitecto, la encuentra inconsciente y perdida entre las dunas y la traslada a su casa, haciéndole creer que es su marido. Las interpretaciones, correctas, se ven potenciadas por el extraordinario magnetismo de Delfine Bafort y la expresividad de Svetozar Cvetković, para construir los dos personajes principales y casi pilares únicos en una historia que se centra en el contrapunto formado por dicha pareja. Pocos personajes más entrarán en juego. Grandes referencias e influencias - Con ecos del cine de Antonioni, Hitchcock o Kubrick, de Clercq busca y consigue construir una experiencia eminentemente visual y sensorial que se nutre, en su concepción estilística, de unos mínimos pero completamente calibrados elementos, trabajados casi a nivel pictórico. El vacío en la mente de Dafne se ve amplificado por el vacío escenario que domina el filme: los áridos parajes de Marruecos de los que de Clercq arranca una paleta de colores llena de significado gracias a un trabajo de fotografía inmejorable. De Clercq apuesta por un uso exclusivo de la luz natural y por los tonos neutros (beiges y blancos), principalmente cálidos en la primera mitad del filme, que adquirirán matices más fríos en la segunda, y entre los que destacan puntuales toques de rojo vibrante que tensan las secuencias y focalizan nuestra mirada. El uso de la música es muy especial y cargado de significado. La partitura de Hacène Larbi, que en largas secuencias sustituye el diálogo, crispa con su composición atonal y con el uso de cuerdas y tambores, a modo de gritos suspendidos. Los escenarios, ya sean naturales o artificiales, tienden a la esencialidad y rehúyen cualquier objeto anecdótico o de relleno. La casa de Jake se sitúa en la magnífica Fobe House, una construcción real diseñada por Guilhem Eustache en Marruecos, sobria y esquemática, con los mínimos tabiques y sin apenas mobiliario. Conclusión – You Go to My Head - El desarrollo argumental de la cinta es mínimo pero sólido. Converge con un ritmo narrativo pausado y unas secuencias que respiran. Las escenas se defienden, rodadas con magnificencia y a la búsqueda de lo esencial. Y es que la cinta se define por lo esencial, incluso en su concepción de thriller. You Go to My Head podrá parecer «vacía» a quien no se deje llevar por la potencia de sus imágenes para adentrarse en la historia que subyace en ellas. Pero quien pueda apreciarla, disfrutará plenamente de la experiencia.
/m/you_go_to_my_head	478cb48e-bee2-3351-ab51-1cff3caf8ef4	5	An Intriguing Love Story. This beautiful movie was filmed in the Western Sahara around Marrakech, Morocco. The stunning cinematography shows the dichotomy of the desert as both a beautiful and dangerous place. It starts with a mysterious car accident that leaves a young woman alone in the desert wandering the hostile environment with no memory of her past. She is eventually found by a local architect who nurses her slowly back to health and takes her back to his large house which also has a beautiful pool. However, he soon falls in love and begins to deceive her by leading her to believe they are actually married and have had a life together. The rest of the story will have you waiting in expectation as she starts to discover the truth about herself with an ending that is a true surprise. This movie is beautifully filmed with cinematography that is a treat for the eyes including stunning desert vistas, ancient ruins, and the aquatic blue water of the gorgeous pool. Lots of analogies abound in this exquisite film which will keep you thinking about them long after the film has ended. The acting is superb by Belgian model and actress Delfine Befort who's beauty is mesmerizing in this film and Serbian actor Svetozar "Toza" Cvetkovic who will have you feeling his loneliness and desire for love. Dimitri de Clercq has created a masterpiece and a unique love story in "You Go To My Head" which will get into yours as well.
/m/you_go_to_my_head	478cb48e-bee2-3351-ab51-1cff3caf8ef4	4	Great love story! You go to my head est une histoire d'Amour bouleversante et déstabilisante ä la fois. La beauté des images filmées toutes ä la lumière naturelle, tant dans le désert du Sahara que dans la maison de Joke - petit joyau d'architecture contemporaine - donnent à ce psychodrame étrange et irréel une atmosphère tout à fait particulière. J'ai été conquise par l'actrice belge Delfine Bafort, dont le talent et la beauté ne font que sublimer ce petit chef d'oeuvre mené de main de maître par le jeune et talentueux cinéaste belge Dimitri de Clercq.
/m/you_go_to_my_head	478cb48e-bee2-3351-ab51-1cff3caf8ef4	5	"You Go To My Head" got into mine and will get into yours! I had the opportunity to view this incredible film at the Golden Door International Film Festival of Jersey City in the Fall of 2018. It's the kind of movie you wish you could watch over and over again. In fact, I'm ready for the sequel. "You Go To My Head" is a beautiful blend of psycho drama and love that stirs the soul and keeps you guessing. Nothing could deter my focus more than what was before my eyes. A brilliant combination of cinematography and artistry! I absolutely loved this film and look forward to its DVD release to witness the magic once again!
/m/you_go_to_my_head	478cb48e-bee2-3351-ab51-1cff3caf8ef4	5	An intriguing exploration of passion, obsession & love: Set against the stark landscape of the desert, Dimitri de Clercq's exploration of two lives whose paths have crossed in a most unusual way, invites the viewer into their complex and tumultuous world -- as they seek answers to life's burning questions: who am I, what do I truly desire, and why? Throughout each moment, one cannot help but to feel every emotion of these characters whose quest for meaning and wholeness -- is truly universal. The cinematography is sumptuous, the characters are seductive, and the story throughout -- is nothing short of tantalizing.
/m/you_go_to_my_head	478cb48e-bee2-3351-ab51-1cff3caf8ef4	4	Gorgeous, emotional mind trip. I was an assistant with the Spokane International Film Festival's selection process, and when this absolutely stunning film came up, it was an immediate selection. It might be a bold declaration, but some of the visuals in this truly unusual thriller are comparable to "Lawrence of Arabia," with how it captures vistas, minimalism, and just showcasing the story. The premise begins with an enticing, Hitchcock-esque first act, and it descends into pure psychological territory from there on out. The direction is excellent, cinematography beautiful, editing is fluid, and performances are fantastic. The pacing is slow but deliberate. Keep it on your radar, and for sure add it to your watchlist this February, because this is one of the most beautiful films I have seen in recent memory.
/m/nomadland	02f8b20e-a561-323d-b51e-61392357d3f9	1	I'll be polite and say it should have been a documentary.
/m/nomadland	02f8b20e-a561-323d-b51e-61392357d3f9	4.5	Chloe Zhao's Nomadland is a haunting and tender tale of loss and survival.  Shortly after losing her husband to cancer, Fern (Frances McDormand) loses her job at a gypsum plant in Nevada when the company shuts done due to an economic downturn, forcing her to live out of her van as she travels from state to state looking for employment.  McDormand is, as usual, fantastic, but the power of the movie rests in the hands of the secondary characters she meets on her travels, each with their own unique perspectives on life.  The film is also bolstered by some beautiful cinematography by Joshua James Richards and effectively restrained editing by Zhao herself.
/m/nomadland	02f8b20e-a561-323d-b51e-61392357d3f9	3.5	Most adults have suffered terrible loss, many more recently in the days of the global pandemic. This story speaks to me of loss of a loved one.  That terrible experience.  The one no one talks about, because there are no words. I want to share this film with those I love, because I cannot speak, but this film does so for me.
/m/nomadland	02f8b20e-a561-323d-b51e-61392357d3f9	5	An visually and incredible film, shows emotions of an USA you never saw, a story about the forgotten.
/m/nomadland	02f8b20e-a561-323d-b51e-61392357d3f9	4	As an entire package, this film succeeds on so many levels. The exploration of the human experience on both a large and small scale is captivating and achieved with care; friendships, relationships with family, love, loneliness, independence, perseverance, joy, adaptability and so much more. Chloé Zhao portrays so many different emotions with thoughtful balance, and when the ‘characters' in this film, who feel like real people, feel joy or sadness, you feel it too. The cinematography of the American West along with the score of the film are constantly shown off and just add to the full ensemble. When the credits roll, the entirety of this film slowly soaks in and there is an even greater appreciation for what was achieved here. This is a film that explores what it means to be human and will leave you feeling happy, sad, but mostly appreciative of the world and our time in it.
/m/nomadland	02f8b20e-a561-323d-b51e-61392357d3f9	4.5	Raw. Powerful. Zhao treats nature as a main character in the film. She gives life to the landscape and shows the US from a different perspective.   The story is ver well written. McDormand is amazing! Einaudi's score is beautiful!
/m/nomadland	02f8b20e-a561-323d-b51e-61392357d3f9	0.5	This movie is super dry and kinda just boring. I really don't understand why it's getting such good reviews.
/m/nomadland	02f8b20e-a561-323d-b51e-61392357d3f9	1	Nomadland is a boring film. It is about a woman in her sixties who embarks on a journey through the American West after losing everything in the Great Recession. Francis McDormand and Linda May give horrible performances. The screenplay is badly written. Chloe Zhao did a terrible directing this movie. I was not impressed with this motion picture.
/m/nomadland	02f8b20e-a561-323d-b51e-61392357d3f9	5	Rarely does a movie provide you with a feeling of loneliness. Photography lends to the emptiness of Frances Mcdormand's situation. This is a must see movie if you're like dramas. Also an interesting look into the nomadic lifestyle of the snowbirds.
/m/nomadland	02f8b20e-a561-323d-b51e-61392357d3f9	0.5	Depressing, hopeless.  If I wasn't already living in a van this movie would talk me out if it.
/m/raya_and_the_last_dragon	565d2359-d27e-3f04-884b-c931f2b2ec4f	2	Not one of Disney's best
/m/raya_and_the_last_dragon	565d2359-d27e-3f04-884b-c931f2b2ec4f	3	Es como cualquier otra pelicula, como para un domingo en la tarde, tiene un buen mensaje, buena animacion, pero es algo cliche, lo que le baja puntos
/m/raya_and_the_last_dragon	565d2359-d27e-3f04-884b-c931f2b2ec4f	4	Beautiful movie.  Gorgeous animation, great action, comedy, but also with some serious parts.  Also a great message.  I think the ending wrapped up a little too perfectly, but it is a kids' movie after all.  A great movie for the whole family.
/m/raya_and_the_last_dragon	565d2359-d27e-3f04-884b-c931f2b2ec4f	4	This movie introduced the phrase "What's dripping" to the audience and nobody has done anything about it. If you walk up to a friend and say what's up instead of what's dripping you are out of touch with culture.
/m/raya_and_the_last_dragon	565d2359-d27e-3f04-884b-c931f2b2ec4f	4.5	A beautifully animated movie that hones in on a relatable theme and brings a positive message with lovable characters.
/m/raya_and_the_last_dragon	565d2359-d27e-3f04-884b-c931f2b2ec4f	2.5	Enjoyable, but not that fresh. Even I was proud that Disney get all the story and try to represent Asian heritage, but the message and value are still too much western for me. What's the point of bringing so much and rich culture like SEA but they are just using like a speck from it?
/m/raya_and_the_last_dragon	565d2359-d27e-3f04-884b-c931f2b2ec4f	3	While the animation was beautiful, and the voice acting was spot-on, I was underwhelmed by Ray and the Last Dragon. Its message rang hollow, to me, and the narrative fell flat. Ultimately, I felt like the rich, southeast Asian mythology and culture of this film was squandered by a boring story and underdeveloped characters.
/m/raya_and_the_last_dragon	565d2359-d27e-3f04-884b-c931f2b2ec4f	5	This movie is undeniably one of the best of Disney's latest animated endeavors. The story is enrapturing, the animation is astonishing, the voice acting and characters are spectacular, everything! Plus, the messages and themes it had were not only meaningful but very well-worked and executed. It's a greater preference than "My Little Pony: A New Generation", that's for sure.
/m/raya_and_the_last_dragon	565d2359-d27e-3f04-884b-c931f2b2ec4f	4	Every time I watch a Disney/Pixar animated film I get confused as to what do I write in the review. It is now a cliche to say that the animation was great, the characters were adorable and the message was heartwarming. Although I could not help but compare it to the Avatar: The Last Airbender show wherein a similar protagonist has to save and reunite the world from a bad side. It is never bad to take inspiration from elsewhere if you can improve it and admittedly Disney does put their own spin on the story. The message given here can be seen confusing at times because the film says one thing and shows the exact opposite. Nevertheless, these are minor flaws in an amazing feel-good movie that will stay with you for couple of days at least. Recommended!
/m/raya_and_the_last_dragon	565d2359-d27e-3f04-884b-c931f2b2ec4f	4	Another great animated Disney film
/m/two_of_us	ded56009-0310-3cba-8a4f-bc8cb38191a8	4	When focused on the relationship of Barbara Sukowa (Nina) and Martine Chevallier (Madeleine) the film tells an elegant love story that is subtle and complex and speaks to a different generation.  When the movie goes into a bizarre subplot involving a care giver you wonder how something so delicate could be throw so off kilter.  It's a film about relationships and taking care of each other and it's charming.  The French really can speak to romance!  Final Score: 7.7/10
/m/two_of_us	ded56009-0310-3cba-8a4f-bc8cb38191a8	2	A frustrating film in that too much of the story is driven by lack of communication, silences, and inexplicable intolerance of gay love. Why wouldn't the very compassionate partner simply speak up in the beginning of the film to support her stricken partner? Why would the loving daughter be so intolerant? Why would an otherwise caring woman stiff the caregiver?  Film would have made more sense set in another time period.Lovely performances, though.
/m/two_of_us	ded56009-0310-3cba-8a4f-bc8cb38191a8	5	RATING: A+  Director: Filippo Meneghetti Two of Us is a fantastic piece of filmmaking and it is even more astonishing when you see that this was the Directors Directorial Debut. The three Leads are all fantastic especially the main lead, Barbara Sukowa, does an excellent acting showcase. The Screenplay is utterly brilliant as is the Direction. The Cinematography is worth a mention too. On one side this I a love story on the other its real sad. It's a bit sad though that the International Feature branch at the Academy Awards didn't recognised this film.
/m/two_of_us	ded56009-0310-3cba-8a4f-bc8cb38191a8	4	This is a phenomenal film. Economical, smart, very empathetic writing combined with equally empathetic, confident directing and excellent use of tone and editing make for one of the finest films of the year, and as good a romance as I saw from 2020 or 2021, so far. That all says so much about director Filippo Meneghetti.  Sukowa and Chevallier are truly exceptional. It's like they've embodied these roles; like two stage actors on a two year run of the same play. So authentic is their chemistry together. So glad they didn't have Mado as some flailing, mumbling mess like Hopkins in Legends of the Fall.  Nice supporting work by Drucker and Benazeraf.  I've seen Minari as a nominee (and winner) for Best Foreign/Non-English Language film from several awards groups. Personally, Two of Us is twice the movie Minari is; much more powerful emotionally and cerebrally.  4.2 stars
/m/two_of_us	ded56009-0310-3cba-8a4f-bc8cb38191a8	4	simply beautiful and moving
/m/two_of_us	ded56009-0310-3cba-8a4f-bc8cb38191a8	3.5	I enjoyed this movie, but the "psycho" wasn't psychotic enough for me. It bothered me, too, that no one ever mentioned the disappearance of a treasured item. Sad ending, but unforgettable.
/m/two_of_us	ded56009-0310-3cba-8a4f-bc8cb38191a8	5	A moving and heartfelt story proving that love and its hardships are not reserved for teenagers.
/m/two_of_us	ded56009-0310-3cba-8a4f-bc8cb38191a8	4.5	How and who we love has undergone tremendously liberating changes in recent years, but, for some seniors, who remember a time when such taboos could not be revealed, the past painfully lingers on into the present. So it is for an aging French woman who is unable to tell her secret to her adult children, leaving her longtime lover on the sidelines when a tragic event disrupts their happiness and lives together. Director Filippo Meneghetti's debut narrative feature is an intensely gripping and moving work, one that grabs viewers by the collar and makes the frustration experienced by its protagonists truly palpable -- and infuriating. The superb performances by Barbara Sukowa and Martine Chevallier are riveting and heartfelt, achieving powerful impact with gestures as simple as facial expressions and piercing views into their eyes. There are a few incidents in the narrative that seem a bit far-fetched, but they're compensated for by everything else this release has to offer, already a multiple awards season nominee and a shortlist contender for best international film at the Oscars. The pain and warmth of this one must be experienced by anyone with a conscience -- or a pulse -- to see that, no matter how far we have come, there's always more ground still to be made up.
/m/two_of_us	ded56009-0310-3cba-8a4f-bc8cb38191a8	4.5	Two of Us is such a beautiful romance film that is uniformly strong in pacing, direction, acting performances and dialogue, but it is especially deserving of praise for its very grounded in reality, melodrama-lacking approach to storytelling that made the movie more believable and elegant. The final scene is touching and the emotional engagement here is undeniable.
/m/the_changin_times_of_ike_white	9bc86f3a-6058-309b-8a7e-9c212760ed0b	4	If there's a fine line between genius and insanity, Ike White blurred that line and for that reason you have never heard of his name.  A significantly flawed man, with a talent for music, White is fascinating figure that was a blank canvas for filmmaker Daniel Vernon.  Often, the tale gets muddled and it ends way too fast which left me wanting more.  At 77 minutes, there may not be much more good to be said about the subject. It's the kind of story that will be made into a series or a film.  It has to be.  Someday people will know the name Ike White.  Final Score: 7.8/10
/m/the_changin_times_of_ike_white	9bc86f3a-6058-309b-8a7e-9c212760ed0b	5	A helter skelter life captured beautifully.
/m/savage_2019_2	89ca5f3d-cc94-30e8-b287-96ce24be663e	3	New Zealand gang film. Less full-on than I expected, and doesn't have the same psychological impact as Once Were Warriors. The script is light on character development, and could have delved deeper into the cultural context of the gangs.
/m/savage_2019_2	89ca5f3d-cc94-30e8-b287-96ce24be663e	4	This movie could be hard to watch if you are not familiar with our gang culture or New Zealand. At bit like Once were warriors (Very NZ focused).  I feel this is a real deep look into the gang culture and some of the obstacles some of our people experience.  An eye opener.  I highly recommend watching this movie, but come in with a open mind.
/m/savage_2019_2	89ca5f3d-cc94-30e8-b287-96ce24be663e	4	I can see this movie being hard to watch if you aren't from New Zealand or familiar with our gang culture. I personally found Savage to be a deep, hard look into some of the darkest corners of NZs past and the effects they had on young men at the time. New Zealand wasn't always Hobbits and compassionate Prime Ministers. I highly recommend this movie if you want a look at some of the hard truths of our society.
/m/savage_2019_2	89ca5f3d-cc94-30e8-b287-96ce24be663e	1	Sigh, not enjoyable at all
/m/savage_2019_2	89ca5f3d-cc94-30e8-b287-96ce24be663e	5	Great movie.  Emotionally intense with excellent performances by Jake Ryan and John Tui.  Highly recommended.
/m/savage_2019_2	89ca5f3d-cc94-30e8-b287-96ce24be663e	5	Great movie about crime, gangs, violence blood, tattoos, drugs, murder, and.... family.
/m/savage_2019_2	89ca5f3d-cc94-30e8-b287-96ce24be663e	1	2 hours of my life I won't get back.  Grunting lead actor. Absolute shit
/m/savage_2019_2	89ca5f3d-cc94-30e8-b287-96ce24be663e	5	Great movie. If you like that kind of movies!
/m/savage_2019_2	89ca5f3d-cc94-30e8-b287-96ce24be663e	3.5	Pretty good Kiwi film about a man who is torn between his loyalty to his gang and his family. I quite liked it though I feel some of the characters could have been fleshed out more, worth a watch.
/m/savage_2019_2	89ca5f3d-cc94-30e8-b287-96ce24be663e	4	Brute force in filmmaking best describes this tour de force for the strong willed. This is not a movie for weak willed viewers. There is nothing easy going about this story once it gets going. The New Zealand gang life which this is based on is brutal and at times hard to watch, but there is a great morality tale embedded in the story. If "feels" like someone filmed a real life occurrence while it happened then added fictional elements just to keep the story from biting too hard. It works though and if you like hard-hitting macho man bullsh**t in your movies you're gonna love this. It definitely hits different.
/m/my_little_sister_2021	0296eb8f-d47a-49e1-a09a-20bd1e9d2a11	4.5	A beautiful film about the love between a set of fraternal twins.  Every actor is pretty much just right, and the choice of music and the understated, lyrical cinematography makes this little film a piece of great art.  The two directors of this film must be geniuses.  This lovely, quiet picture will make you better for having watched it.
/m/mayor	c65ba522-3caf-4b05-babc-91f95cec77ae	5	A superb documentary, Mayor is well worth a watch
/m/mayor	c65ba522-3caf-4b05-babc-91f95cec77ae	5	Really engaging film. Surprisingly funny at times (literally laugh out loud).but more often rage inducing at the injustices of the Occupation and the unfairness for people who just want to be allowed to live their lives with dignity.
/m/mayor	c65ba522-3caf-4b05-babc-91f95cec77ae	4	This is a harrowing look at the dire situation in Palestine mainly through the eyes of Musa Hadid, mayor of Palestinian city Ramallah.  It's just unreal to live anywhere freely and not be free.  I didn't know a lot about this situation, but by all accounts it's sad and mostly bleak.  Let's hope for peace and understanding.  This was a really good film that I'm sure it just touching the surface of what's happening.  Final Score: 8/10
/m/mayor	c65ba522-3caf-4b05-babc-91f95cec77ae	5	If you are thinking of buying or renting this movie, do it, it is worth the price. David Osit does a fantastic job balencing tension with black comedy. It shows how the Palestinians are suffering under Israeli occupation with no bias towards the Israelis.
/m/mayor	c65ba522-3caf-4b05-babc-91f95cec77ae	5	This film staggered me. The ending made me feel things I couldn't put into emotions and I just stared at my screen for 20 minutes. Loved this film and will never stop thinking about it.
/m/mayor	c65ba522-3caf-4b05-babc-91f95cec77ae	5	One of the most powerful documentaries I've ever seen. Osit does an exceptional job of capturing Ramallah through the daily life of the titular character, Mayor Musa Hadid, while at the same time creating an ambitious, often funny, and aesthetically pleasing film.
/m/stray_2021	f35cad87-9caa-47d9-94e8-cbcfd4f921cf	4	An immersive and powerful view. And that is because the point of view is the one of the invisibles. Human and dogs alike.
/m/stray_2021	f35cad87-9caa-47d9-94e8-cbcfd4f921cf	3.5	Elizabeth Lo's intriguing documentary follows the escapades of three stray dogs through the streets of Istanbul, quite literally. Choosing to shoot the majority of the film at the same eye level of Zeytin, the main focus of the three dogs, the camera follows behind her as she goes about her daily business. Lo captures Zeytins eyes with such effectiveness at times, it seems that you can tell exactly what she's thinking, and this makes for a captivating view of the city from a completely alternate point of view. It's astonishing to see for yourself how these strays keep themselves alive, how they learn to find kindness, and how they have to deal with trouble which inevitably find them. It also makes a great double bill with......
/m/stray_2021	f35cad87-9caa-47d9-94e8-cbcfd4f921cf	5	Possibly in my top ten of all time great films. Exceptional, outstanding. Oddly one of the most human films you're ever likely to see.
/m/stray_2021	f35cad87-9caa-47d9-94e8-cbcfd4f921cf	4	So hubby and wife date night was all about watching stray dogs in Turkey and it was pretty fun.  It's a documentary filmed from dog level and there's some serious shaky cam which kinda works here, but don't watch this on your phone.  If you become immersed in this universe you'll love the film.  If you love dogs you'll love this film.  It's gentle and the ending is wonderful.  Quick at 72 minutes!  Hubby: 8.0 Wife: 7.2 Average 7.6/10
/m/stray_2021	f35cad87-9caa-47d9-94e8-cbcfd4f921cf	2.5	Kedi, the doc about stray cats in Turkey, was great. Following around a different cat in each segment, each with something of its own personality, its own neighborhood or haunts, was compelling as they felt like actual characters to an extent. Not so with Stray, which follows one dog more or less, but with much less interesting results.  The quotes were distracting, and seemed like some lame attempt to add more depth to a rather thin, unsubstantial documentary. 2.8 stars
/m/stray_2021	f35cad87-9caa-47d9-94e8-cbcfd4f921cf	0.5	Dogs are terrorizing the streets, attacking people. This is a shame seeing stray dogs roaming in the cities.
/m/stray_2021	f35cad87-9caa-47d9-94e8-cbcfd4f921cf	4	An amazingly original concept i.e. to follow a stray dog at street level over time. It's a must watch for dog lovers, but it also captures the tragedy of Syrian refugees. Stick with it right through the credits because it keeps raising your emotional response. Will Rogers said, 'If there are no dogs in Heaven, then when I die I want to go where they went.'
/m/stray_2021	f35cad87-9caa-47d9-94e8-cbcfd4f921cf	4	Beautifully filmed. And having been there, I appreciate the reality of what was being filmed.
/m/stray_2021	f35cad87-9caa-47d9-94e8-cbcfd4f921cf	5	One of the best movies documentaries I have ever seen.I been all over the world too many places.Never seen Istanbul in this light,I love the no kill no catch to animals.Though I feel there should be more action in a positive manner could be taken when that many dogs are on the streets.Dogs & cats have feelings like humans.I can only wish and assume further actions will be taken in finding them homes or making them shelters for the poor strays.All God's animals are just as important as humans and should be treated as such.We all live in this world together.Why not make the best of it in the little time we have here on earth.Dogs in this case have a shorter life expectancy.So let's do our part as human beings and show love to these dogs.👍🏼💯🇲🇽🇺🇸
/m/stray_2021	f35cad87-9caa-47d9-94e8-cbcfd4f921cf	3.5	It's the kind of movie that makes you go "awwwwwwwwwwwwww" about every 30 seconds. However, director Elizabeth Lo's debut documentary feature about the street dogs of Istanbul -- which are legally protected against euthanasia and illicit captivity -- diverges from its central narrative a little too much, pursuing tangents that draw attention away from its principal subject. In particular, the film devotes considerable attention to the city's homeless refugee workers, an attempt to draw parallels between Istanbul's street people and their canine companions, an intriguing approach that, while interesting, comes across as somewhat unfocused. The film would have fared better if it had sought to do for the city's street dogs what "Kedi" (2016) did for its feral felines. If you're looking for a film loaded with loving footage of adorable pooches, "Stray" makes for a nice diversion. However, if you're searching for groundbreaking documentary filmmaking, this one misses the mark, despite seemingly good intentions.
/m/cowboys_2021	eebc19cc-cb47-4902-b280-e4dbe32eed4f	3	Putin cam simplu, dar bun pe emotie
/m/cowboys_2021	eebc19cc-cb47-4902-b280-e4dbe32eed4f	4	Great story with issues that could be based on real life, well acted and engaging. Really worth watching.
/m/cowboys_2021	eebc19cc-cb47-4902-b280-e4dbe32eed4f	3	Despite some serious third act problems, 'Cowboys' touches on serious topics with grace and dignity.  While there are several issues with the movie one of them isn't the performances of Steve Zahn and Jillian Bell.  The same can't be said for Sasha Knight who is a newbie and it shows.  It's a very nuanced role, playing a transgender child, but with acting vets by his side, Knight stood out like a sore thumb.  Despite those quibbles, it's a beautiful film and at 87 minutes, certainly doesn't overstay its welcome! Final Score: 6/10
/m/cowboys_2021	eebc19cc-cb47-4902-b280-e4dbe32eed4f	5	Emotional, passionate, and captivating story. Wonderful acting. Very human.
/m/cowboys_2021	eebc19cc-cb47-4902-b280-e4dbe32eed4f	5	Loved it! Great message. Great acting.
/m/cowboys_2021	eebc19cc-cb47-4902-b280-e4dbe32eed4f	3.5	Completely different from what you expect of a Steve Zahn movie. The trailer is kind of tricky, for the film is not actually happy, yet it is really good. I enjoyed it a lot
/m/cowboys_2021	eebc19cc-cb47-4902-b280-e4dbe32eed4f	5	Beautifully told journey of the young guy & his family.  Acting is superb -- Mom, the kid, the Dad, Dad's buddy, the Sheriff -- all very convincing.  And the Montana landscape of course does not disappoint.  Well done, all!  Thank you for this excellent film.  MUCH APPRECIATED (sorry about the caps, but I wanted to emphasize!). I hope all of America can see this, and let's open our eyes y'all!
/m/cowboys_2021	eebc19cc-cb47-4902-b280-e4dbe32eed4f	4	I think this film focuses on emotion, highlighting the identity of the characters. It also deals with the support and unconditional love of a father for her daughter, always trusting her, allowing her to give her a degree of confidence about the comments that society made about her identity or personality. The father being the only one capable of understanding the child's situation, constantly supporting her over any adversity.
/m/cowboys_2021	eebc19cc-cb47-4902-b280-e4dbe32eed4f	2	The audience score is right on this one. The subject matter was important. They just didn't a lousy job with it.
/m/cowboys_2021	eebc19cc-cb47-4902-b280-e4dbe32eed4f	5	Genuinely beautiful and moving. I cried three times. Well told, and beautifully made. Sasha Knight is going to be a star I think.
/m/little_fish_2021	1debee9b-be52-3b0e-8adb-5b2d6447720d	4	Beautifully shot and powerfully written, Little Fish is a barely-pre-COVID pandemic movie that not only feels grounded, but becomes its own thing as a study of memory loss and the power of love.
/m/little_fish_2021	1debee9b-be52-3b0e-8adb-5b2d6447720d	3	The unconvincing gimmicky ending didn't make the long dragged out 101 mins any less painful. This film was originally written as a short story by Aja Gabel, and writer Mattson Tomlin - who's main experience is writing short films, extended this one to a long dragged out 101 minutes of frustrating back and forth convoluted timelines and lackluster jumbled narrative.  It's should've stayed as a short film. There was just too much mushy filler for the little substance this story had to offer. It needed much more guts and finesse, because by the end, you're left unsatisfied and depressed from the story - and the time you invested watching it. You can literally fast-forward many of the scenes, and not miss a thing.  The performances were great, especially the adorable Olivia Cooke, but I struggled understanding some of her narrating with her deep English accent. The narrating wasn't necessary, because you'll still get lost in some of the timelines. Better directing by Chad Hartigan "may" have saved this film from its many flaws and annoyances, and/or editing out at least 30 mins.  It's a generous 6/10 from me, mainly for the performances and the decent score and cinematography.
/m/little_fish_2021	1debee9b-be52-3b0e-8adb-5b2d6447720d	4	Quietly devastating (especially getting released by total coincidence during a global pandemic) yet very lovely, 'Little Fish' will slowly pull out your insides.  There's a gentleness, but it's really hard to not come away from this sad.  While the film often celebrates happiness, that happiness has a shelf life.  Hopeful, yet full of dread, it resonates based upon the times we are in!  A totally different take on dementia and Alzheimer's. Final Score 8/10
/m/little_fish_2021	1debee9b-be52-3b0e-8adb-5b2d6447720d	3	Performances were really powerful from Olivia Cooke and Jack O'Connell. They are ones to watch!
/m/little_fish_2021	1debee9b-be52-3b0e-8adb-5b2d6447720d	4	I found it to be really beautiful and moving. Totally recommend!
/m/little_fish_2021	1debee9b-be52-3b0e-8adb-5b2d6447720d	1	Gosh. What a disappointment. It was too bad because there was some great acting but they couldn't save this cliched and shallow screenplay.
/m/little_fish_2021	1debee9b-be52-3b0e-8adb-5b2d6447720d	4.5	Beautiful, moving.  Arguably they just reverse-engineered The Notebook (the filmmakers said "hey - you know what's super cute: people who love each other but lose their memories!  Now, how do we get that on screen...?").   Also, I found myself wanting to see more of the broader impact of the Pandemic on Society as a Whole (the film ended up being more a Romance about the Couple than a Science Fiction about the Pandemic/World).  But nevertheless Little Fish was great: moving and entertaining. ... Far better, in my view, than Wander Darkly (a film that feels like its trying to do similar things).
/m/little_fish_2021	1debee9b-be52-3b0e-8adb-5b2d6447720d	4.5	Little Fish is a beautiful romance showing love and loss in a pandemic hit world, and unbelievably it was made before COVID. Top performances from Cooke and O'Connell who possess bags of chemistry. This film is a big catch.
/m/little_fish_2021	1debee9b-be52-3b0e-8adb-5b2d6447720d	4	“All these little pieces. I find myself wondering how to build a future if you keep having to rebuild the past.” Yet another film about a pandemic that coincidentally came out amid a pandemic, Little Fish has a couple fighting to hold their relationship together as a memory loss virus spreads and threatens to erase the history of their love and courtship. It may seem skeptical going into this considering all the experiences we’ve had throughout the past year, but this is a film we need right now. This is a beautiful film. Based on a short story, newcomer Mattson Tomlin adapted it into a screenplay. The film is very well written. Many lines stick with you throughout the runtime. And the dialogue showcases a relationship in a really nice way that isn’t too typical or one without meaning. Chad Hartigan does a lovely job directing. He directed Morris from America which fell under the radar (granted it was independent) when it should’ve gained more attention. The direction shines through clearly. As for cinematography, Little Fish has no right to look as good as it does. I mean, this is one of the best looking films recently (meaning this year). Sean McElwee will be going places soon just because of his work here. Even the score is good and very fitting for the film. Essentially, the technicals are just very good. Driving the film are two good performances by Olivia Cooke and Jack O’Connell. Olivia Cooke has been making her way up in more things recently, most notably Sound of Metal. She has bigger things in her career coming her way. I took particular interest in her character and acting in general. She has a way of capturing love and sorrow just perfectly. And Jack O’Connell does well with his character and the memory loss aspect. I’m glad that memory loss wasn’t portrayed too over the top in anyway. It’s more subtle by changing smaller things and not just “I don’t remember anything.” There’s a cool thing they do with the camera work of blurring things out but not blurring them out. It’s like what you see when you’re having a migraine, which is just spectacular. The film can follow a format that you’d think it will go in. It’s a little hard to divert from some cliches with what they’re given. I will say the end is going for something. You can kind of piece is together or at least something similar as you near the end. The ending is really good. I wish there was a little more, not necessarily clarity, but something like that. It’s handled in a way that’s just slightly confusing but makes sense. I don’t know how to describe it and it might just be a me thing. All in all, Little Fish is a film we need right now. With great filmmaking and (coincidentally) social relevance, it’s enjoyable and something you can get invested in.
/m/little_fish_2021	1debee9b-be52-3b0e-8adb-5b2d6447720d	3	A somewhat har watch because it tells such a depressing story but does so in a way that grips you. Olivia Cooke is fantastic in this heartbreaking film.
/m/notturno_2021	52eb8445-ba0c-41f2-bd79-fe77951ea163	4	More of a Frederick Wiseman documentary than anything else, your enjoyment of Notturno will invariably come down to one thing.  Do you have empathy for people from foreign lands who may not be the same color as you?  Choose Wisely.  Final Score: 8/10

/m/dear_comrades	1808005f-869f-34ab-99fe-8b2fd957ffb5	4.5	There's a line towards the end of Dear Comrades! (the exclamation mark is deliberate and important to the through line of the film) where Lyudmila, the central character and a staunch communist questions how her town has fallen apart throughout the course of the film. It says everything about the state of the Soviet Union in 1962 when the film is set, that despite the fact that failing communism is so clearly the cause of Lyudmila's desperate situation, and yet she just cannot see it.  Such his her unquestionable faith in the system, that early on during the KGB massacre of Novocherkassk (unsurprisingly previously kept under wraps by the Soviet Union) her daughter goes missing and she claims that when she finds her she will hand her into the authorities herself. In 1962, workers from the small industrial town of Novocherkassk went on strike after the communist government raises food prices, Lyudmila's daughter among them. The army is called in to deal with the situation, but more pertinently, KGB agents are amongst the crowd, as well as a sniper on a roof of the building. What follows is horrific, and the film is shot in beautiful black and white, and director Andrey Konchalovskiy captures the authenticity of the period fantastically. Julia Vysotkaya is excellent in the central role as Lyudmila; you fully feel the frustration and terror of her situation, as well as her conflicting emotions with regards to her loyalty, her daughter or her party. Dear Comrades! is an exceptional portrayal of a little known Soviet atrocity, offering the viewer real insight into the way the communist party affected the Soviet people and their political factions within small towns, showing just how difficult it was for those in power of a town taking orders from the government and the military, and then themselves having to take the brunt of the publics' disapproval with decisions. It's a really impressive piece of work.

/m/dear_comrades	1808005f-869f-34ab-99fe-8b2fd957ffb5	4	The film, based on a true story, takes place in 1962, when workers in a factory, complaining about high prices of food, food shortages, and low wages, went on strike. To break the strike, the government fires on the protesters, killing several, and went to extreme measures to cover up the murders. The film is shot in black and white, which gives it an interesting air of history and the times when most broadcasts were in black and white. It is a commentary on the extent that governments go to hide the truth, but the best part of the film is the story about a party member on the local council in the city where the strike is occurring. She manages to get special privileges in terms of food, cigarettes, and other things, but when her daughter goes missing, she is forced to confront the larger picture of what she is seeing. We become part of a more intimate look at the crisis in the context of her personal drama. Her performance is excellent and is what really sold me on the film and kept my interest. The film gets a thumbs up from me. It was on the shortlist for Best International Film, but it did not make the final cut.
/m/dear_comrades	1808005f-869f-34ab-99fe-8b2fd957ffb5	4	Dear Comrades! is not that well paced, overly obvious in certain moments and it risked becoming overly straightforward at first, but it was elevated by a very moving arc of the protagonist played superbly by Julia Vysotskaya who performed the woman's conflicted emotions powerfully. The movie's stark black-and-white photography is very effective and the third act is emotionally devastating. It's an important look into the numerous horrors of Novocherkassk massacre and communist Russia at large.
/m/dear_comrades	1808005f-869f-34ab-99fe-8b2fd957ffb5	3.5	Andrei Konchalovsky's Dear Comrades! is yet another harrowing tale documenting the horrors of Soviet-era communism. Set in 1962, the film depicts the real-life Novocherkassk massacre in which the Soviet Army and KGB execute protesting workers following escalating price controls and wage reductions The storyline principally involves a committed Communist Party apparatchik who searches for her missing daughter after the mass execution leading to a difficult confrontation with the nature of the false promises of the totalitarian society she has committed herself to. As such, Dear Comrades! casts large, horrific shadows of doubts of the over bright-eyed utopian visions over one of the greatest evils of the 20st Century.
/m/dear_comrades	1808005f-869f-34ab-99fe-8b2fd957ffb5	5	Dear Comrades! is the best Russian film everyone worldwide must see!
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	4.5	Well written movie with great acting. I'm glad I watched it.
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	0.5	My wife and I watched this together after it received reviews in excess of 90%. There must be some kind of scam going on because this is among the worst films I have ever watched and I am close to 50 now and have watched a lot of films. It’s made the bottom 10. Absolute garbage.
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	3.5	Great movie for 50ish folks looking to get pandered too in the best ways so we have knowledge we're not alone in getting old with bad knees and sore backs, but that we are still worthy.
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	3	This tongue-in-cheek kung fu movie has a few laughs and is fun to watch. THE PAPER TIGERS plays like the armchair quarterback dad turned out to really have some skillz at the game, having to break off the rust and get back out there for one final push to the endline.
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	3	Without higher hopes this movie is a very good choice, but when you demand something it's not stay here for you. Truly disappointing. 6/10
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	4	A random Saturday with time to kill, remember hearing this was pretty good and saw it in the Netflix queue.  I'm so glad I gave it a watch, figured I would play it in the background while playing a computer game and had to stop gaming to watch the movie.  It was a very pleasant surprise, with some great performances, drama, and comedy.  Well worth a watch, especially if you like some some martial arts mixed with comedy in an old school way.
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	4	Gung fu Panda lol.   The biggest and only appeal of this movie on Netflix for me was that it was written and directed by a Vietnamese person. And I'm glad that I decided to watch this movie.  What I loved the most were the jokes. There were the typical jokes where characters acting goofy, and then some were quite racist and crude jokes. Some might not like these, but I was cracking multiple times throughout. The goofiest character was for sure Carter because he acted like those racist white people trying to impersonate gung fu moves. So yeah, you gotta go to this movie with the right mindset to not get offended.   The choreography was decent, not anything impressive like those other fitting action movies. Some parts were cheesy as heck. However, it's clear that the fight wasn't the main intention. Instead, the movie focused on the theme of standing up and fight when necessary for honor. I was surprised that there was heart to the story. It was shown amazingly through the scene between the main character and his son on the phone.   As for problems, I wanted to know more about the main character's past to understand his motivation more. I already said this but some parts, not just the fights, were cheesy.  Overall, a funny and entertaining movie with a good heart. 8/10

/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	5	Loved this movie. Reminded me a bit of Kung Fu theatre from the 70's and 80's but with good acting, and a good story:)
/m/the_paper_tigers	bd3e4fb0-ed14-381e-bf83-b2025f8fe09c	5	Awesome movie hope for a prequel or sequel
/m/bloodthirsty	7476616b-7395-40bb-ae88-1244558b23b8	4	Sometimes the most interesting and unique art comes from a place of darkness/primality and that isn't always a good thing for everyone involved but this should be an enjoyable watch for fans of the horror genre.
/m/bloodthirsty	7476616b-7395-40bb-ae88-1244558b23b8	0.5	What a shame…. One of the worst one… they should have asked for an antic expert for the set design! What is a modern house from 1980 doing here? And the furnitures! My god! all imported from China few years ago… it was supposed to be owned since few generations… the fake gothic doors built in the frame made me laugh! A lot of errors everywhere… even absinthe was not done the way it is supposed to! No culture … but this is movies today made for stupids… Don't talk about any Special effects … very poor … don't waste anytime here!
/m/bloodthirsty	7476616b-7395-40bb-ae88-1244558b23b8	2.5	I can smell something from you. Something primal.  Not sure how I found out about this movie, but it seemed promising with a high Rotten Tomatoes percent and critics saying that there's a lot of gore. And boy if that wasn't a big lie.   For an hour and 24 minutes runtime, this sure felt long. However, this slow pace made sense considering what the movie was aiming for. Some parts crept me out a bit, but the whole time I was hoping that this would lead to a crazy, bloody, and gory ending.  Sadly I didn't get that. Clearly this was a low-budget movie. Most of the gores were quickly edited and only the blood on the character's face was shown. Honestly if there's more dedication to the gore and designs, this movie could have been entertaining.   The acting was quite bad, especially  from the actor that played the painter girlfriend. I did not buy her reactions at all. Also, one scene was incredibly cringe between her and the main character.   Overall, I was very disappointed with the boring ending and lack of real gore. 5/10
/m/bloodthirsty	7476616b-7395-40bb-ae88-1244558b23b8	2	meh; the story is interesting enough, but the build up is SUPER slow & SUPER unsatisfying. honestly, almost nothing happens. the whole song writer/singer aspect wasn't really all that believable either - not sure if it was the casting, the acting, or the dialog or what. i wouldn't recommend this one.
/m/bloodthirsty	7476616b-7395-40bb-ae88-1244558b23b8	2	Bad boring vampire turning movie. The main issue that I have with this movie is the main character. She doesn't have the presence of a world renowned musical artist. She has the presence of a normal person with a normal job. I'm not trying to hate on the main actress but I don't believe her as a pop star. And the horror aspect of this doesn't work either. Its not a tense movie. It just happens and it feels very boring the majority of the time. It's unfortunately another movie that I'll forget about in 2 seconds.

/m/bloodthirsty	7476616b-7395-40bb-ae88-1244558b23b8	3.5	This unusual way of representing the story of werewolves it's original and the suspense generated was ok. However i felt kind of a lack of "what's next" with this girl.
/m/bloodthirsty	7476616b-7395-40bb-ae88-1244558b23b8	4	Intriguing story and the music is perfectly fitting.
/m/bloodthirsty	7476616b-7395-40bb-ae88-1244558b23b8	3	A horror film that spends more time on the psychological side of things than on the werewolves. It's not a bad film but somehow the elements don't come together as well as they should. Didn't hate it, didn't love it.
/m/supernova_2021	c8787875-bd73-47b3-9c22-f4226b6af7b9	4.5	Tucci and Firth provide quiet yet intense performances in close up directing style. Submitting to mortality does not diminish the intensity of their love, quite the reverse. Happy endings are sought by us all, however Supernova asks the audience to revisit, rethink and accept their possibilities.
/m/supernova_2021	c8787875-bd73-47b3-9c22-f4226b6af7b9	3.5	"Sam and Tusker are travelling up to Cumbria (NW England) in their camper-van to visit friends, family and places from their past. Since Tusker was diagnosed with dementia two years ago, their time together is the most important thing they have."  Tusker is somewhat older than Sam and has no intention of fading further into dementia with Sam martyring himself as his (controlling) carer.  There is a rather silly astro-physics sub-plot (we all come from exploded stars – hence the silly title), quarrelling en route, and a lot of cringe-making English jollity and hugging by family and friends.  There are some wonderful shots of Cumbria.  But it is a film about Rational Suicide (via Pentobarbital), a subject nearly as taboo as masturbation – which is why it is not mentioned in the reviews.  I thought the acting rather wooden, but the subject (and the landscape shots) saved the film from sentimental disaster.  Worth seeing - and worth knowing (as few who watch it will) that the sentimental piano piece which is part of the plot is Salut d'Amour (In praise of love) by Elgar.
/m/supernova_2021	c8787875-bd73-47b3-9c22-f4226b6af7b9	1.5	Wrapped up to be the saddest pointless thing ever produced, this plot is bad written and dangerously developed resulting in a cold story completely empty in feelings. Each gesture and interaction is badly shown, as you can immediately see in the first two minutes driving interaction which is extremely goofy and ugly. The use of  the gay couple  feels like an obvious attempt to catch a statue maybe thinking that the sick homosexual is a guarantee (Milk, Philadelphia, Green Book, Transamerica, Dallas Buyers Club). My husband and I felt very disturbed and distant from each single thing it shows and on top of the horrible ending, the bunch of friends are even sadder than the two main characters. Tucci's most static role, never thought I could like Firth more, but just a tiny bit. Too much.
/m/supernova_2021	c8787875-bd73-47b3-9c22-f4226b6af7b9	5	I really enjoyed the movie. The characters were so believable and acting excellent.
/m/supernova_2021	c8787875-bd73-47b3-9c22-f4226b6af7b9	3	For me, it felt as though there was a lack of emotional diversity, which may be what's missing. More dramatically joyous and sombre scenes would have juxtaposed each other, thus making those moments more poignant. Instead, the film's pace trundles along in a kind of grey area between happy and sad. You could argue that Supernova isn't dissimilar to Nomadland in that respect, but I'd argue that Nomadland pulled it off.  Read the full review: https://saltypopcorn.substack.com/p/supernova
/m/supernova_2021	c8787875-bd73-47b3-9c22-f4226b6af7b9	4	The movie didn't always connect the way it should have, but the actors do.  I'm firmly in staunch Stanley Tucci fandom, but Colin Firth delivers such an indelible performance of loss.  Although there are some missed opportunities in this film, the actors give it their all and Firth reaffirms why he is so good.  There's always that that one scene where a great actor connects, and Firth delivers it with a fury.  Tucci is his charming self, but Firth turns it and flips the charm upside down.  The one who grieves...so good.  Worth watching.
/m/supernova_2021	c8787875-bd73-47b3-9c22-f4226b6af7b9	3	There was something rich and organic about this picture that I really appreciated. It didn't look scripted or rehearsed at all - in a GOOD way. However, it was a little bit too slow for my liking, and I found the ending dragged quite a bit. Otherwise, good performances and very well done.
/m/supernova_2021	c8787875-bd73-47b3-9c22-f4226b6af7b9	3	I really enjoyed Colin Firth's and Stanley Tucci's performances in this film. They really brought life to these characters struggling with deep and dark issues. What's holding the film back is that the film never really depicts Tusker's dementia with full force. Sure, Tusker has problems putting on a t-shirt, forgets the word for "triangle", and kinda gets lost with their dog, but is Tusker's problem really any worse than someone who is a little forgetful, or someone who is a little hungover? The film keeps the true problem vague and thus, while the impact of the film should be deep, it all feels a little vague, shallow, and even sentimental.
/m/supernova_2021	c8787875-bd73-47b3-9c22-f4226b6af7b9	5	I rate a "must see". Going into the film, I watched the trailer so I knew what to expect. But even with that, the film involves us into the story that is told. The landscapes, the acting, characters and emotions, they all involve us into the story that is being told. Colin Firth and Stanley Tucci were brilliant innit, a very good acting. It's a drama, and for people that love dramas this is a must see.
/m/supernova_2021	c8787875-bd73-47b3-9c22-f4226b6af7b9	5	I thought this film was beautiful and touching about two partners facing mortality.
/m/nasrin	e19849d8-dc12-464b-8e14-a32e38596760	4.5	"Courage under fire" is an expression that could best be used to describe Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh. The lion-hearted attorney has defiantly taken on a variety of cases defending women, children, religious minorities, persecuted artists and outspoken political reformers against overblown charges brought by a fundamentalist government regime seeking to suppress opposition at any cost, including instances involving blatant illegality, unethical conduct and outright lying. And, for her efforts, she has gained international notoriety but at a cost to herself, including imprisonment and physical torture. Director Jeff Kaufman's superb documentary look at Nasrin's heroic life chronicles the many challenges she has faced while unflinchingly depicting the stalwart defiance she has demonstrated in the face of odds frequently stacked against her. The filmmaker also candidly yet sensitively illustrates the counselor's human side -- her family life, her involvement in the arts community, and the heartfelt compassion she genuinely feels for her clients and causes -- proof of the authenticity guiding her actions. Clandestinely shot in Iran under the threat of prosecution and narrated by Oscar winner Olivia Colman, "Nasrin" paints a truly remarkable portrait of a truly remarkable individual.
/m/nasrin	e19849d8-dc12-464b-8e14-a32e38596760	5	Nasrin is an inspiration to the human race.  This documentary gives us in a glimpse into Iran and the brave citizens that are looking to make a difference.  A must see!
/m/nasrin	e19849d8-dc12-464b-8e14-a32e38596760	5	Very impressive and an eye opener for those who do not know our Wonder Woman Nasrin!
/m/nasrin	e19849d8-dc12-464b-8e14-a32e38596760	5	This film is jaw-dropping, heart-wrenching, and ultimately empowering in the most poignant and beautiful way. The story is woven together delicately in a way that truly shines a bright and needed light on the heroic vigilance of the under-represented women of Iran. Do NOT miss your chance to watch this film, it will grip your heart and sharpen your mind.
/m/nasrin	e19849d8-dc12-464b-8e14-a32e38596760	5	Jeff Kaufman and Marcia Ross's work is amazing and truly admirable.   NASRIN documentary portrays an honest picture of  Nasrin Sotoudeh, a human rights lawyer whose humanity leads her on the courageous and heroic path of tirelessly fighting for the rights of those facing the death penalty- children, women- religious minorities, and artists and journalists.  NASRIN documentary is deeply moving.     N
/m/nasrin	e19849d8-dc12-464b-8e14-a32e38596760	5	This is such a well-made documentary film about an amazing woman, Nasrin, Iran's Mandela! If you want to see a different portrait of Iran and its people's valiant struggle for freedom, then see this film.
/m/nasrin	e19849d8-dc12-464b-8e14-a32e38596760	4.5	Wonderful! Nasrin Film is impactful and moving, a very accurately made documentary about Nasrin Sotoudeh, the Iran's Mandela and the voice of voiceless in Iran. It depicts the Daily life of this Brave Woman, responsible advocate and defender of Human rights, as well as mother of two teenagers. It does a good job of explaining the full picture of Islamic regime's Violation of Human Rights and Crimes to those of us who pursue freedom, love and peace.  This is also a very powerful documentary if you're able to read between the lines to see what is going on somewhere else in the world.  I've watched it three times now and got excellent feedback from whom I recommended this Film to watch. It is really worth watching!
/m/nasrin	e19849d8-dc12-464b-8e14-a32e38596760	5	Deeply moved by the selfless act of Nasrin, a devoted wife, mother, human rights attorney and activist defending the rights of the most marginalized population in Iran. The music score is fantastic snd transcending. I am inspired and hopeful after watching this movie. Nasrin's courage calls me to action to continue to hold dear and appreciate our own democracy in the US.
/m/butchers	6e514cfc-13f3-474d-8d2a-bd63dc045e9d	0.5	Overrate For this kind of non scary bloody movie, it just lost its selling point. If it can't be better than others, no point to produce this. Also, this kind of movie no need storyline much, be bloody and scare audience and cut the crap out. And this one too many storytelling, Zzzzzzzz.
/m/butchers	6e514cfc-13f3-474d-8d2a-bd63dc045e9d	3	not bad, really. it was maybe a little longer than it needed to be, but as far as back-woods-no-goods goes, this was decent I think. i REALLY love how it ended; it ended how it should've ended. I'm not sure i'd recommend it, but I'm not sad i watched it.
/m/butchers	6e514cfc-13f3-474d-8d2a-bd63dc045e9d	1	It gets good at 1h:27m.🤦🏽‍♂️
/m/butchers	6e514cfc-13f3-474d-8d2a-bd63dc045e9d	5	I usually don't watch horror movies but this movie was filmed in my area and I recognized a lot of places and the tow truck which is quite popular in our area. The characters were fantastic.  The storyline flows very well.  Not a lot of guessing as to what's going on ... editing well done.  The effects are extremely realistic & gruesome.  Although I'm not a horror fan, I do encourage people to watch this movie. It's good, it's really good.
/m/butchers	6e514cfc-13f3-474d-8d2a-bd63dc045e9d	2	Very slow, good scenes, but it looks like a mashup of teen horror movies and The Farm cheap. An the end is a failure.
/m/butchers	6e514cfc-13f3-474d-8d2a-bd63dc045e9d	1	Amazing that this sort of movie is made every year and has been for the last 50 years and nothing has changed.
/m/butchers	6e514cfc-13f3-474d-8d2a-bd63dc045e9d	2	Not as bad as its title or premise might make you think but not above average neither. It doen't really bring nothing new to the table. The dialogues are not very helping in the first half and the movie doesn't really know what it want to be really about...the flesh indeed but hesitating between culinary and sexually without deeply exploring neither of one and waiting too late on to unleash the real evil. It is sad because the directing is not bad and the cinematography helps not making it look like a B-movie. The actors do what they can but feel sometimes as lost as the viewers. If you're really into horror like me give it a shot or pass.
/m/butchers	6e514cfc-13f3-474d-8d2a-bd63dc045e9d	2	Was ok / lot of the same thing here . Also would love some night scenes . The entire movie is in the daylight
/m/butchers	6e514cfc-13f3-474d-8d2a-bd63dc045e9d	2	It's fairly entertaining, but painfully unoriginal that it's almost parody level. It's got some good ideas, but also some incredibly stupid character moments. For me it was totally a mixed bag in every aspect. Certainly not bland but it still falls into the category of an average film, because for everything thing positive this film has to offer there is something you could find to hate about it. I will say that I thought Simon Phillip's performance as Owen was great and I was hooked from start to finish, but it's not anything that will live long in the memory and this has all been done before and better. If you're a fan of the horror genre I'd just about recommend it but keep your expectations low.
/m/rams_2021	28b0da5a-daf1-406a-8dfe-8dc5022fcbbd	3	Rams (C-) (72) Oddly entertaining.. had so many weird moments though... Loved some scenes and others felt very odd.... Not always in a good way.
/m/rams_2021	28b0da5a-daf1-406a-8dfe-8dc5022fcbbd	3.5	Rams – An Aussie Re-run This Australian remake of a prizewinning 2015 Icelandic film classic (of the same name) makes for a pleasing watch but goes for a lighter approach than its famous predecessor. The bright Western Australian countryside is well utilized as against the bleak, frosty, windblown setting of the dramatic original. Performances are uniformly fine with all bringing this well-made, sorrowful tale, of family dysfunction to a satisfying (albeit upbeat) close. Antony Partos provides the music score.
/m/rams_2021	28b0da5a-daf1-406a-8dfe-8dc5022fcbbd	2.5	Terrible plot, movie is not very interesting either
/m/rams_2021	28b0da5a-daf1-406a-8dfe-8dc5022fcbbd	3	Love Michael Caton, but I was lukewarm on 'Rams' the original from Iceland, and feel entirely the same about the Aussie version!  Part screwball comedy, and part feel-good, but not enough of either.  It just didn't work all of the time and while there are moments, there may not be enough for everyone's taste.  If you don't like this, go check out Caton in 'The Castle'.  Final Score: 6/10
/m/rams_2021	28b0da5a-daf1-406a-8dfe-8dc5022fcbbd	3.5	Interesting story. Sam Neill is getting into some seriously quirky characters in his later years.
/m/rams_2021	28b0da5a-daf1-406a-8dfe-8dc5022fcbbd	4	Great fun, with meat. Insightful portrayal of rural life, Australian style. Sam is a superstar, of course, and Lionel is  special..and everyone does a great job.
/m/rams_2021	28b0da5a-daf1-406a-8dfe-8dc5022fcbbd	3.5	Despite an unpromising premise, Rams is an unpredictable and entertaining Australian movie.  Two older brothers are rural Australian sheep breeders who haven't been on speaking terms for years.  One brother has his stuff together and the other doesn't.  This story is about the relationship between the two and the small farming community they live in.  Sam Neill gets the majority of the air time and does a great job.  The script is skillfully crafted while being built from an extraordinarily mundane foundation.  Because of accents and slang, the dialogue can often be difficult to understand.  Subtitles don't help with the slang (Fair dinkum mate).  Rams is a pleasant surprise that almost earns 4 stars.
/m/rams_2021	28b0da5a-daf1-406a-8dfe-8dc5022fcbbd	3.5	Rams provides a lot to enjoy, especially for Sam Neill and animal lovers. The relationship between the brothers is the highlight. It may not reach the heights of the icy original, but this one still burns bright on its own.
/m/rams_2021	28b0da5a-daf1-406a-8dfe-8dc5022fcbbd	4	A surprising film that has massive heart and commitment from its cast and crew.
/m/rams_2021	28b0da5a-daf1-406a-8dfe-8dc5022fcbbd	3.5	Pleasant, light, fun little movie.
/m/reunion_2021	9f79e5bf-b350-4282-9f0d-2ed8daa56854	5	The acting of the two actors is overwhelming. A tense atmosphere tightens the heart all the time. The combination of occult and thriller.
/m/reunion_2021	9f79e5bf-b350-4282-9f0d-2ed8daa56854	5	I felt that time had passed by when I saw Julia Omond after a long time. But I was pleased to see her performance that was still alive. The movie tells the secret of a family history, but it shows delicacy and sophistication in expressing it. It's a very interesting and meaningful piece of work.

/m/reunion_2021	9f79e5bf-b350-4282-9f0d-2ed8daa56854	2	Honestly, the story was pointless. The writing was nothing. The actors were good, the cinematography was also good. Sound was also good.
/m/reunion_2021	9f79e5bf-b350-4282-9f0d-2ed8daa56854	2.5	"Reunion" is a creepy, is it , is it not , all in the mind type horror, thriller. It is a Moody, uncomfortable movie that takes a while to build to its unnerving final act.   The premise of "Reunion" Is that a young pregnant woman, Ellie, arrives back at her family home many years after leaving. As she has inherited the property following the death of her grandparents she expects to be alone to get the property ready for sale. Also she is happy to have some alone time to complete work on a book she is writing. What Ellie doesn't realise is her mother and disabled father are also at the house and part way through the process of clearing things out and undertaking necessary repair work. As Ellie settles in, she accepts her mother could help with the house clearance and can also be of help due to her pregnancy.  Soon after settling in Ellie starts to see a ghostly figure of a young child in a red dress. As the film progresses we discover the girl in the red dress was Ellie's stepsister who tragically died in the house. Was it Ellie who was responsible for her death or is the apparition trying to point Ellie in another direction. As the film progresses the rueful PTSD weighs heavily on Ellie and we are left with the uncertainty of if any of it is actually real or all in her mind.  After Ellie reconciles with the truth about her stepsister, "Reunion" twists and seems to be concluding on the newly and genuinely upsetting mother and daughter reconciliation. However this is not the end and as the film then take a completely different turn the audience are left with an unpredictable and very unnerving last act.  In conclusion I found "Reunion" to be a slow burner until the last act. It seems to drip feed clues to what is occurring throughout the film and head you in a direction of lost mother daughter relationship due to tragedy. Only in the last 15 minutes is the true reveal of the films unnerving plot and any real grisly action, unfortunately it does take a while to get there.
/m/reunion_2021	9f79e5bf-b350-4282-9f0d-2ed8daa56854	1.5	Wanted to love this movie, but sadly it just didn't deliver on any of the promises it was making, ended on a weird, unearned, ambiguous and flaccid cliffhanger
/m/reunion_2021	9f79e5bf-b350-4282-9f0d-2ed8daa56854	2	The most interesting thing about the movie "Reunion" is trying understand what it is about the film that makes it so bland, so unremarkable, and instantly forgettable. I am genuinely obsessed with getting to the bottom of this & pinpointing exactly how and why this movie failed so thoroughly to spark a single emotional connection — much less establish a even a moment of actual immersion.  The most I could possible tell you or anyone else about this movie without "spoiling" it, (implying there's a story that is told, which there really isn't; implying there are a couple of twists, which there aren't unless you happen to only look at the screen for 20% of a film's runtime...then maybe, sure, there might be a "surprise" or two if you aren't watching more than a quarter of the movie at all).    Reunion would have succeeded if it had achieved the label of "boilerplate Southern Gothic styled melodrama," (an atmosphere it so aggressively wants to create); however from the opening credit sequence alone it all but tips it's hand right away, like an over-excited grade schooler who immediately runs around the playground and shouting out all of their classmate's secrets. If you really want to watch a fully formed domestic Horror film that dabbled in stuff like the occult, the Southern Gothic style of storytelling/genre, and one that avoids going off the rails like the inchoate student film project that Reunion comes across as, then might I recommend you watch "Relic" (2020) instead. Thank me later.
/m/reunion_2021	9f79e5bf-b350-4282-9f0d-2ed8daa56854	1.5	What did I just watch? It was slow and mostly depressing with a little tension and a well acted mother character. I didn't enjoy it and apart from Julia Ormond, it was a waste of time.

/m/skyfire_2021	ed4c40b7-1d86-318f-b280-4110b942a982	0.5	Wow talk about a dumpster fire, out of the pan and into the fire. And into the fire, and into the fire. These people had no less than 10,000 lucky rabbits feet up there butts. Some of the coldest liquid lava ever. They are literally on fire with zero sense of urgency. This was pretty bad.
/m/skyfire_2021	ed4c40b7-1d86-318f-b280-4110b942a982	1	Una copia "cinese" in tutto e per tutto di Jurassic Park; con l'unica eccezione dell'assenza di dinosauri. L'alto budget non copre una trama non molto originale e sicuramente improbabile per larghi tratti. I personaggi sono quasi tutti già visti e poco interessanti.
/m/skyfire_2021	ed4c40b7-1d86-318f-b280-4110b942a982	3.5	Kindergarten CGs really need some works, absolutely even the audio can do better with their fat budget. Can take a page from 97' "Dante Peak", good enough to re-watch even today. Too much focus on techs looks bit overcooked gonna burn soon, smells some propaganda as usual. Actors looks too pretty face to be Volcanologists; perhaps hired from to K-Pop... lol. Too much extravagant thrill, suspense, excessive drama & lame stunt to little real Geological sense.  Swim in their clothes on? Some bikini is okay even for family enjoyment. The Genre should starts with drama first then anything else.
/m/skyfire_2021	ed4c40b7-1d86-318f-b280-4110b942a982	0.5	Worst movie I've seen in a long time.  Made an account here just to say how bad this movie is.  Not a single positive thing about this film.
/m/skyfire_2021	ed4c40b7-1d86-318f-b280-4110b942a982	1.5	Bad CGI, bad acting. Why Apple allowed this in their store bewilders me. I want a refund.
/m/skyfire_2021	ed4c40b7-1d86-318f-b280-4110b942a982	3.5	I found it fun, SFX were decent, plot was a little thin, but... not too bad or preachy... Spoiler: half expected a ball of magma to be clinging to something and heading towards a city as the final theme, like old horror movies used to... indicating the 'monster' was alive and looking for a new home.
/m/skyfire_2021	ed4c40b7-1d86-318f-b280-4110b942a982	5	This was a super good action movie and the graphics were near perfect.  Watch in Mandarin with subtitles so it doesn't sound like anime.
/m/skyfire_2021	ed4c40b7-1d86-318f-b280-4110b942a982	2	2 out of 5 stars. Terrible and cheesy direction. Tedious acting. The visual effects are horrible. It takes a disaster film into a whole new ridiculous way.
/m/happily	cb66807a-4ab5-45f2-b530-ba4e9a7a7284	5	Loved it. 100% unpredictable and funny. McCale is one of the funniest guys in Hollywood.
/m/happily	cb66807a-4ab5-45f2-b530-ba4e9a7a7284	4.5	This is a great film for people who enjoy absurdist theater and don't mind ambiguity. It's weird, off-beat, kooky, loopy, and no, you're not going to get your main question answered. But it's a fun ride and a crazy romp with a delightful cast and perhaps a magic marriage councilor. This is not a spoiler: you won't find a moral here and you'll be at a loss if asked, "what's that film about?"
/m/happily	cb66807a-4ab5-45f2-b530-ba4e9a7a7284	0.5	This film had such promise but literally ended with NOTHING. Don’t waste your time. I really hoped that the gun room would lead somewhere but the whole thing was a waste of time. This film makes no sense and a waste of time.
/m/happily	cb66807a-4ab5-45f2-b530-ba4e9a7a7284	2.5	Happily starts with the intriguing premise of true love (blissful happiness) but then turns wacky when a stranger shows up and tells the couple they're defective.  A stay at an air-bnb with friends reveals all the couples secrets...but without much of a landing point.
/m/happily	cb66807a-4ab5-45f2-b530-ba4e9a7a7284	3	i quite liked this one, actually. it's got a bizarre feel to it that I really enjoyed. the people were weird & the story was weirder - & well put together, I thought. I'm not sure that little "circle of truth" would've played out in real life quite as well as it did in the film, so that was maybe a little weird in the opposite direction, but they close it out nicely.
/m/happily	cb66807a-4ab5-45f2-b530-ba4e9a7a7284	3.5	It seems like crap but why does it fell so gooood ,and..who doesn't need new friends..extra bonus songs tonight is what it feels to be young and enola gay perfect ending -extra plus bonus kerry bishe is so hot!!
/m/happily	cb66807a-4ab5-45f2-b530-ba4e9a7a7284	2.5	Hart to like a movie with people you wish would just talk to each other and leave the rest to live nice lives without their toxicity tainting it
/m/happily	cb66807a-4ab5-45f2-b530-ba4e9a7a7284	0.5	Not worth your time.
/m/happily	cb66807a-4ab5-45f2-b530-ba4e9a7a7284	3.5	I thought the acting was good enough and the premise was pretty original and interesting enough 3.3
/m/happily	cb66807a-4ab5-45f2-b530-ba4e9a7a7284	3	Meh!  It was intriguing enough to make me want to see the end but my husband was twitching and getting very very bored right from the start.  I had a bit of a laugh….a bit…. but for this to be labeled a comedy is just down right laughable!!  I enjoy black comedy and this was not that. It could have been so much more. I did enjoy the camera angles and cinematography, which boosted this up a star.
/m/willys_wonderland	7edba3df-60e5-4678-8791-52dda185b7af	5	I do not understand how there can be bad reviews for this film, people take things way to serious. Its ridiculousness on a large scale, so much fun and over the top violence. Great film to just shut your brain off for a couple of hours and just enjoy for what it is and what it is meant to be. 10/10.
/m/willys_wonderland	7edba3df-60e5-4678-8791-52dda185b7af	5	This might be Cages best movie. It's just downright fun and, surprisingly high quality. I loved it.
/m/willys_wonderland	7edba3df-60e5-4678-8791-52dda185b7af	1	Awful from start to finish. Nicolas Cage doesn't say a word . Woefully bad acting and the silliest script I've ever seen. What are you doing Mr Cage .
/m/willys_wonderland	7edba3df-60e5-4678-8791-52dda185b7af	5	A cult classic. Great execution.
/m/willys_wonderland	7edba3df-60e5-4678-8791-52dda185b7af	1	It looks like Nicholas cage will do anything for a buck for me it was just awfull sorry
/m/willys_wonderland	7edba3df-60e5-4678-8791-52dda185b7af	2	This honestly didn’t even feel like a real movie . About as dumb and Nicholas cagey as you can get . Overall terrible but like a fun, funny terrible if that makes sense 1.9/5
/m/willys_wonderland	7edba3df-60e5-4678-8791-52dda185b7af	5	This movie is absolutely insane and I love it. It's about Nick Cage trying to clean a restaurant and play a foosball machine in peace. There's a bunch of evil animatronics trying to kill him sure but he's gotta a job to do and he's not gonna let them stop him. Terrible and bloody backstory who? Nick Cage does not care. If he has to tear apart some possessed machines to complete his mission, then by god he's gonna do it.   There's also a subplot about a bunch of teens that's kind of obnoxious but mostly forgettable, It's a fun, wild ride from beginning to end and that's all it has to be.
/m/willys_wonderland	7edba3df-60e5-4678-8791-52dda185b7af	5	The humour was right up my street!
/m/willys_wonderland	7edba3df-60e5-4678-8791-52dda185b7af	4.5	A hilarious and surreal horror comedy with pretty good special effects and a clever premise.

/m/donna	10d2f8f3-6435-3372-9220-6e4b86890ab7	5	This film is a must-see! "Donna" tells the story of a strong-minded woman who overcomes her battle with domestic abuse and goes on to accomplish her career goals as well as raise a beautiful family. The film is beautifully acted, shot and scored. I highly recommend!
/m/donna	10d2f8f3-6435-3372-9220-6e4b86890ab7	5	Donna is an exceptional, must watch movie! I hope that it wins many awards. The writing is outstanding.
/m/donna	10d2f8f3-6435-3372-9220-6e4b86890ab7	5	This movie was touching, heartbreaking, and empowering. The actors portray their roles so well in telling the story of Donna. Kate Amundsen shows both strength and vulnerability so well in her role, making you grow attached to the story. It shows the importance of friends' and family's love and support throughout rough times and perseverance no matter what. DONNA is a great representation of a topic that deserves awareness!
/m/donna	10d2f8f3-6435-3372-9220-6e4b86890ab7	5	A beautifully shot film and an empowering story! A young woman, caught in a domestic violent relationship, is determined to break free, be happy and live her American Dream. She overcomes many obstacles on her journey all while being a single mother. Donna is a voice for all women out there in similar situations. Donna shows how women are strong, independent and true warriors. A MUST watch!
/m/donna	10d2f8f3-6435-3372-9220-6e4b86890ab7	5	This movie is very amazing and inspiring for women all over the world. Donna's story brings hope, strength, and encouragement for many, especially to those who have experienced a similar situation. It is very empowering and it is a must watch! I hope this message is able to help bring women back onto their feet and know that they are strong.
/m/donna	10d2f8f3-6435-3372-9220-6e4b86890ab7	5	Donna is an inspirational person as she overcomes the struggle of an abusive relationship. This movie carries a strong message of empowerment. I absolutely recommend it.
/m/donna	10d2f8f3-6435-3372-9220-6e4b86890ab7	5	Thousands of years of suppression that leads to conditioning and the reality that we're left with is that we can never see the full impact of any movement without real change in Domestic Violence. It's the root and exposing the shame and stigmas surrounding this is helping to create real change. This Film is gentle, captivating, emotional and engaging at each moment. It's created a time capsule for Long Island, New York and a legacy for one brave women that represents every woman's voice and story.
/m/donna	10d2f8f3-6435-3372-9220-6e4b86890ab7	5	This is a must watch movie. It is so powerful and insightful. Let your voice be heard!
/m/donna	10d2f8f3-6435-3372-9220-6e4b86890ab7	5	This movie is for every woman, their battle cry, now hear us ROAR! Tradition, small minded thinking, do not stop Donna from manifesting her destiny. There is no obstacle too great, no man too scary or strong to stop her from finding her value and worth, as she walks away from a sad life into a strong one. This Film is for all the girls and women of tomorrow, we are strong, we can do and be whatever we want! We do not need a man to make us complete! Great movie, cast, locations, Director and such a beautiful story!
/m/donna	10d2f8f3-6435-3372-9220-6e4b86890ab7	5	Donna, Stronger Than Pretty is an inspiring story! Rising above domestic abuse and the cycle of repetition we so often see in our society. The main character's journey and transformation into a warrior is just the kind of example women need in a situation for which there really is no "handbook". Bravo for portraying strength in a way that comes from the heart and soul, rather than revenge or money, as we so often see from Hollywood.
/m/son_of_the_south	55c1a519-4a0e-4e06-b20b-3ed58ee2a4db	3.5	Es una película decente y no merece la mala crítica que recibió; la trama es pasable y la actuación de Lucas Till es decente; es recomendable.
/m/son_of_the_south	55c1a519-4a0e-4e06-b20b-3ed58ee2a4db	5	Beautiful. Beautiful film. It is clear that Lucas Till, Lucy Hale and Lex Scott Davis are Oscar-winning stars in the making, and I think it'll be a major injustice if they fail to be nominated for their respective performances here.
/m/son_of_the_south	55c1a519-4a0e-4e06-b20b-3ed58ee2a4db	0.5	The fake Southern accents are just the starting point of how bad this movie is. For such a real and serious moment in history, this film's dialog, character interactions, musical score, and acting make extremely light of the situation. Not sure who thought this was a good portrayal given today's race relations. Bad take. Even made Rosa Parks look dumb.
/m/son_of_the_south	55c1a519-4a0e-4e06-b20b-3ed58ee2a4db	2.5	A simplistic sample of how Zellner teamed up with the Freedom Summer Project, I think the character's portrayal lacked a little more depth.  It is quite admirable to see his transition from a white boy, privileged and rule-follower to a brave activist aware that a revolution was needed, but Zellner's story has a gigantic potency that has not been deservedly instigated here!  In theory, it is relevant, but not enough!
/m/son_of_the_south	55c1a519-4a0e-4e06-b20b-3ed58ee2a4db	5	A poignant and personal look at how the civil rights movement of the early 1960s prompted a young white Alabaman to recognize his own humanity and act on it. This film could serve as a good start for those seeking to learn about the movement.
/m/son_of_the_south	55c1a519-4a0e-4e06-b20b-3ed58ee2a4db	2.5	I feel somewhat the same towards this film as I did to last years The Last Full Measure with the main similarity being that it's heart is in the right place but it doesn't do a lot to distinguish itself. The message of this film is inspiring but it's a message that's told in most films relating to the Civil Rights Era. The performances were all around decent. There was one bad performance but most everyone else did a good job with what they were given. The script is okay at best. Like I said, the script doesn't do enough to make this film stand out and the dialogue is mediocre at best but not terrible. In terms of cinematography and music, it's average. Nothing special about the music or the way the film is shot. There really isn't too much to say since it doesn't do a lot for me. It's got a good string foundation that just doesn't build off of it that well. Check this out if you're interested in the subject matter but you could probably pass on this one.
/m/son_of_the_south	55c1a519-4a0e-4e06-b20b-3ed58ee2a4db	3	Great material expressed in a very disjointed manner. lacking any cohesive story line I found it impossible to get into and was glad when it was finally over.
/m/son_of_the_south	55c1a519-4a0e-4e06-b20b-3ed58ee2a4db	5	Excellent movie.....talented cast, beautiful cinematography.
/m/son_of_the_south	55c1a519-4a0e-4e06-b20b-3ed58ee2a4db	5	Son of the South is inspirational and engaging, a story that holds weight today.  As noted by Rosa Parks within the movie, "...we all have a choice to make, not choosing is also a choice."  Poignant movie, excellent characters.
/m/son_of_the_south	55c1a519-4a0e-4e06-b20b-3ed58ee2a4db	5	Deeply inspiring.   An unfortunate truth of racism in America is that illogical malevolence gives rise to conspicuous gallantry.   Would the Freedom Riders been as successful without white allies?   Would Bob Zellner's sleeping inner-activist been roused by another cause?   We don't know.   What we do know that the empathy shown by Bob and people of his ilk to love their fellow humans is the blueprint for society.      There's a certain nobility that comes from voluntary risk taking.   The white American civil rights ally is a special monster.   Loving; fierce, resilient and obviously noteworthy.    See this movie.  See this movie again.    And answer the question.   What side are you on?
/m/donnys_bar_mitzvah	af0cbb8b-ba35-4dd3-b98b-4a3edd9221c0	3	This was a pleasant surprise.  It's way over the top with some of the things that happen all during Donny's Bar Mitzvah, but it's all done in a way that wIll undoubtedly elicit a laugh even during some of the most preposterous scenes.   At a sparse 79 minutes, this one certainly doesn't wear out it's welcome.  Ridiculous fun.
/m/donnys_bar_mitzvah	af0cbb8b-ba35-4dd3-b98b-4a3edd9221c0	5	This is how legendary cult classics are born! This film is epic in the most offensive possible ways, it's mild hits of racism hardly skim the surface compared to the multitude of other raucous and perverse lines and scenes. That NYT writer is twit for the review she gave this comedic masterpiece, uppity NY attitude has no time for the brilliance of next level humor this film introduces. But buyer beware, this is one F'cked up film and the 18+ rating should probably be more like 25+ Lol! Even the most liberal, mature, and ‘sexually advanced,' will find moments in this film to be shocking. It's awesome.
/m/donnys_bar_mitzvah	af0cbb8b-ba35-4dd3-b98b-4a3edd9221c0	0.5	I never made it through the whole movie but I feel the entire thing really portrayed a disgusting light on the Jewish traditions. Not an ounce of this movie has any reflection on what a true time-honored Jewish traditional bar mitzvah is and how important and sacred it is. This movie is fouler than the contents of the pit of an old-time outhouse. Basically, this movie is for teenage hooligans.
/m/donnys_bar_mitzvah	af0cbb8b-ba35-4dd3-b98b-4a3edd9221c0	5	If you are a fun person with a sense of humor watch this immediately.  Don't expect an Oscar winner. Expect a quick, raunchy, absurdist and hilarious 79 minutes of fun.  I had a blast
/m/donnys_bar_mitzvah	af0cbb8b-ba35-4dd3-b98b-4a3edd9221c0	5	A really fun film and easy watch! Is it going to win an Oscar? No. Are you going to leave this film feeling enlightened? Probably not. Is this film going to give you 80 minutes of consistent belly laughter and fun? Absolutely. This is the kind of movie that allows you to escape reality and just breathe for a moment. Quirky characters and absurdist storylines make it super enjoyable to watch with your friends or to throw on in the background when doing other things. Fun, exciting and surprisingly bold for a comedy released in 2021.
/m/long_live_rock_celebrate_the_chaos	02aa89c1-2147-4d12-937a-fe42c6334ffe	3	I love music docs. This one was okay.
/m/long_live_rock_celebrate_the_chaos	02aa89c1-2147-4d12-937a-fe42c6334ffe	5	Loved this film. Must watch – especially for music fans.
/m/long_live_rock_celebrate_the_chaos	02aa89c1-2147-4d12-937a-fe42c6334ffe	0.5	So fucking bad I made a rotten tomatoes account to write this review. I'm ashamed to be a rock fan. I wish I never saw this awful, pointless movie.
/m/long_live_rock_celebrate_the_chaos	02aa89c1-2147-4d12-937a-fe42c6334ffe	5	This is a high energy, high octane love letter to Rock & Roll. Fantastic and quick doc about a subculture that doesn't get enough credit! Loved hearing first hand from all the rockstars and seeing those massive crowd shots. Made me miss concerts even more and can't wait to be back at shows soon.
/m/long_live_rock_celebrate_the_chaos	02aa89c1-2147-4d12-937a-fe42c6334ffe	5	I am a huge music fan, all types. Hard Rock has never been a 'go-to' genre for me, so to be honest I stepped into this experience with a bit of trepidation, unsure of where this journey would take me, would it be the right path? WOW. What an intricate (and loud) exploration of not just the music & the musicians, this film does a great job of sharing so many stories that surround the experience, football teams hired for security, fans from around the country that make life-long friends at festivals, mosh pit extremists and their willingness to help everyone participate (wheel chair crowd surfing is REAL!) A real eye opener, that I am planning on watching again, because like many excellent films/docs, you never catch all the great information on the first trip down the celluloid slide. I say hats off and thanks to all involved in bringing this project to the screen. Two thumbs up from here! Ready to ROCK! See you in the pit!!!
/m/long_live_rock_celebrate_the_chaos	02aa89c1-2147-4d12-937a-fe42c6334ffe	5	This is a must see for all music lovers of all kinds. It is a raw and authentic view into the world of rock not only for a musician but also the fans and participants. Rarely does one get to experience what this industry encompasses, however this film not only tells the story beautifully but is filmed in a way that one feels like they are part of the experience. I loved it in every way possibly to love a film and miss live entertainment and it's community greatly. Thank you to the creators for allowing a little taste of what so many have had such a loss of this past year! LONG LIVE ROCK...❤️
/m/long_live_rock_celebrate_the_chaos	02aa89c1-2147-4d12-937a-fe42c6334ffe	5	Absolutely LOVED this movie! Everything about it! Made me miss live music even more than I already do...
/m/long_live_rock_celebrate_the_chaos	02aa89c1-2147-4d12-937a-fe42c6334ffe	5	Makes me miss festivals and concerts even more. Love how they tie the fans and Rockstars in together to tell a personal story between them all. A lot of heart on all sides in this!! Can't wait for part 2.
/m/long_live_rock_celebrate_the_chaos	02aa89c1-2147-4d12-937a-fe42c6334ffe	4.5	This movie is a love letter to the music, the fans, the festivals and the artists who play hard rock.  It's crazy to believe that - since COVID shut everything down - there haven't been any live shows in over a year and this film made all of us miss it even more.  It does cover a lot of topics but that helps give the full picture from every perspective.  The energy, the performances and the lives (on stage and off) of the musicians was eye-opening.  For all the rock fans or anyone curious about the crazy culture, this movie is a must see.
/m/long_live_rock_celebrate_the_chaos	02aa89c1-2147-4d12-937a-fe42c6334ffe	5	Long Live Rock lived up to the preview and oh so much more.  First, it took us all on a wonderful, much needed memory lane of our favorite bands, what made them special, and the special moment created at each live performance.  That special moment is created not only by the artist, but my the fans themselves who share a passion for the music and the way it makes them feel.  After a year without live music, it was like putting on a family movie reminding me of the experience I love...seeing incredible musicians and bands perform live with others who also have great love for the same artists.  Second, Love Live Rock did an incredible job of putting the viewer in the center of the experience by not only taking a documentary lens to the subject, but by making all of us feel included...touching each of us in the audience no matter your age or what your favorite band may be.  This movie has layers to it.  One watch, I feel like it opened my heart, made me smile and reminded me of why I love rock 'n roll.  I can't wait to watch it over and over as I know that this director has left more in there for me to discover.  I am especially excited to watch this with my two musician teenagers.  These bands have been a great way for their dad and myself to connect with each of them.  Long Live Rock is a way for us to share some of the concern experience with them at a time when live concerts are not in the near future.   Thank you for making this film.  I can't wait to uncover each new layer with each viewing.
/m/brewmance	7f9f1b07-4b09-4d69-800e-1d4cb354c190	5	Absolutely what craft beer needed, a good for the whole family conversation amount what Craft Brewing in America has been, and what it is today.  I am a local of the community that heard about the film and watched it that night, with my kids.  The two intimate stories about entrepreneur teams trying to make it in this evolving world of crafting, while at the same time getting all the titans including Jim Cook with his vivacious personality, Fritz Maytag as the Father of the Revolution, and the master heavy weight champion of Pliny the Elder, Vinnie Cilurzo, was just awesome.  My hats off to the filmmaker, he had me thoroughly entertained for an hour and half.
/m/brewmance	7f9f1b07-4b09-4d69-800e-1d4cb354c190	5	I thought I was coming for the entertainment, but ended up learning a few things about micro brewing! After seeing this insightful doc, i have a deeper appreciation for the taste and flavor of beer - and all that goes into making it. Highly recommend for anyone interested in beer, microbrewing, current history or being entertained.
/m/brewmance	7f9f1b07-4b09-4d69-800e-1d4cb354c190	5	BEER. The storylines around the home brew world combined with the American dream and struggles of family entrepreneurship make this a very entertaining film.
/m/brewmance	7f9f1b07-4b09-4d69-800e-1d4cb354c190	2	More informative and entertaining input from luminary brewers would have saved this well-intentioned film that focused way too much on a pair of upstart brewer endeavors.
/m/brewmance	7f9f1b07-4b09-4d69-800e-1d4cb354c190	3	A fantastic job by the director on bringing a unique story to life in this documentary. When we don't have a lot of beer documentaries, this one is inspiring to watch.
/m/brewmance	7f9f1b07-4b09-4d69-800e-1d4cb354c190	4	Nice doc on home brewing and craft beer.  Not only a nice history of the craft beer movement, with some of the icons of the industry, but also a look at the obstacles of business startup.    I look forward to sampling these beers.
/m/fever_dreams	8aca3167-3b01-4952-a89c-8446a1b0da2b	2	I watched it based on the rave reviews but I don't get it. Is it creepy? Sure. But it just drags along, meandering like the river in the film, but it all seems rather pointless  I would have stopped watching but I kept hoping it would make sense
/m/fever_dreams	8aca3167-3b01-4952-a89c-8446a1b0da2b	4.5	Interesting plot lines for each mini story, has a strong Twilight Zone vibe! Good acting and production as well for not being a major motion picture.
/m/fever_dreams	8aca3167-3b01-4952-a89c-8446a1b0da2b	4	Definitely worth viewing if you enjoyed Twilight Zone back in the day.  With a series of chapters that are not related, this film delivers creepy, dark humor, and pushes the envelope toward the way out there.  Gives that same goose-bump effect that TZ used to when I was growing up!
/m/fever_dreams	8aca3167-3b01-4952-a89c-8446a1b0da2b	5	Very well done with twists to keep you feeling suspenseful. The music in the background also created an eerie sense which helped!
/m/fever_dreams	8aca3167-3b01-4952-a89c-8446a1b0da2b	5	Excellently spooky fun
/m/fever_dreams	8aca3167-3b01-4952-a89c-8446a1b0da2b	5	AWESOME!! A must see! Well written and directed.
/m/fever_dreams	8aca3167-3b01-4952-a89c-8446a1b0da2b	5	Great show, fun and reminds me of the Twilight Zone.  Very entertaining.
/m/fever_dreams	8aca3167-3b01-4952-a89c-8446a1b0da2b	5	Loved the Creepshow/Tales From the Crypt/Twilight Zone vibe!  Great writing and production value!  A must see!
/m/fever_dreams	8aca3167-3b01-4952-a89c-8446a1b0da2b	4.5	Excellent anthology of creepy tales with unexpected twists. Definitely worth a watch- good acting, clever plots.
/m/the_emoji_story	3e4206d0-4dcf-30dd-b330-73cad94d89ba	5	The Emoji Story is much better anticipated Emoji Motion Picture than The Emoji Movie. Just watch The Emoji Story if you love Emojis and if you enjoy a Documentary
/m/the_emoji_story	3e4206d0-4dcf-30dd-b330-73cad94d89ba	1.5	I'm not sure how a documentary that should be fascinating is often borderline unwatchable. There's something really wrong with the narrative. It's all over the spectrum and not nearly as focused as it needs to be.  We have talking heads telling us things we already know.  I had so many questions about this new language, but unfortunately the filmmaker often makes things political and isn't as much concerned about the history.  To say this is all over the place is an understatement.  If you have unanswered questions about emojis, they are likely to stay unanswered.  A colossal failure of a film.  Final Score: 3/10
/m/the_emoji_story	3e4206d0-4dcf-30dd-b330-73cad94d89ba	2	Interesting at times and deeply offensive at other times.  The movies included a good history of how emoji's evolved and how they are continuing to evolve. However, the movie is often disrespectful to those who created and who are are trying to maintain a user friendly Unicode for the world to use.   The movie speaks of cultural awareness and appreciating people of all cultures. However, at the same time they openly call the Unicode consortium  a xenophobic slur (They negatively referred to them as "Yankees").
/m/promising_young_woman	9b475d9d-9abc-3667-85df-e4c17d3d7324	2.5	Promising Young Woman – Promises, but does She Deliver  While this pic may get slightly better as it progresses, it also comes across as a manipulative ‘gotcha' moment, somewhat concocted for the me-too movement. While that may not be all a bad thing, writer/director Emerald Fennell can get away with a lot of emotional leading, and she takes every advantage of doing so - as far as its Awards go, its PC credentials go before it.  The script wavers between coy and highly crass, lurching uncomfortably between several genres. Fennell's ‘lesson' may be well-intended but her methods are often too grotty to keep some of her audience on side.  Her main character, Cassandra (Mulligan) repeatedly puts herself in seriously dangerous situations to lure a variety of opportunistic men to pick her up - while she appears alone & smashed-paralytic at various sleazy bars. Not a smart way to supposedly ‘teach' men a lesson.  She also goes on to place other women in desperate situations to ‘teach' them a lesson (another risky business) But, it's when she poses as a stripper at a raucous buck's party that she crosses the line - definitely placing herself in a foolishly dangerous situation.    It all looks good, with most performances being fine and perhaps with a script that might have offered a broader appeal, this may have been accessible to a larger audience – instead, it aims mainly to the juvenile 'R' rated trendy set.    Prismark 10's posted review (on IMDb in March '21) sums it all up perfectly.
/m/promising_young_woman	9b475d9d-9abc-3667-85df-e4c17d3d7324	4.5	A contemporary revenge thriller with humor, terrific performances, and fantastic direction from writer/director Emerald Fennell in her masterful debut.  Promising Young Woman is one of the best films of its year, and features one of the most satisfying final 5 minutes in recent memory.
/m/promising_young_woman	9b475d9d-9abc-3667-85df-e4c17d3d7324	5	Highly, highly recommended.  Found it to be a tough, emotional experience to watch this,... and I'm still thinking about it the following day. Wonderful soundtrack, surprising plot twists, believable characters.  Dark, disturbing, yet also has moments of sweetness and warmth.  I don't think I will forget this movie anytime soon.
/m/promising_young_woman	9b475d9d-9abc-3667-85df-e4c17d3d7324	3.5	(Semi-spoilers)  To be blunt, hopefully not offensive, and at the risk of sounding chauvinistic (not my intention), this movie is kind of a "All men are bastards or predators" approach to feminism, and it lays that style on thick.  That being said, it is badass to see the scumbags get a delivered a hard lesson.  The film has an uneasy feeling, and it forces you to self reflect on the part that one may have unintentionally (or for some maybe even intentionally) played in things from the past, and/or to feel odd comfort in being able to relate to the main character and her desire for vengeance.  I would've liked to have seen at least one good dude in the movie.  But I guess unfortunately some people aren't fortunate enough to have any of them in their life sometimes.
/m/promising_young_woman	9b475d9d-9abc-3667-85df-e4c17d3d7324	4	Filme é uma forte crítica ao abuso sexual de mulheres. É um tema pesado e o roteiro não tenta diminuir isso, tornando o filme indigesto.
/m/promising_young_woman	9b475d9d-9abc-3667-85df-e4c17d3d7324	5	Original and so much fun!
/m/promising_young_woman	9b475d9d-9abc-3667-85df-e4c17d3d7324	4.5	Brings excellent awareness to the conversation. The screenplay by Emerald Fennell, elevates the film. The Third Act will make or break the film for you, and for me, it made it. 90%
/m/promising_young_woman	9b475d9d-9abc-3667-85df-e4c17d3d7324	3	Promising Young Woman is a bit of a B movie.  It's soapie.  Poor acting.   Transparent story.  Why the high rating by others?  Well, these days, any movie where a woman gets the better of a man, that movie automatically gets a 9+ stars rating.  If you do like that kind of thing, watch Handmaid's Tale.  One positive: "Promising..." does have an interesting ending when I suddenly cared about the main character.  It's not enough to save the movie, though.
/m/promising_young_woman	9b475d9d-9abc-3667-85df-e4c17d3d7324	4	It's not what the poster or trailer makes it look like, way more psychological than some kind of "slash up the rapists". Way deeper than I expected. The ending was little to easy, but the movie overall is well worth a watch. Mulligan is excellent, she really makes you believe her character.
/m/promising_young_woman	9b475d9d-9abc-3667-85df-e4c17d3d7324	5	Breathtaking . This movie is just great!
/m/yellow_rose	50d9f3a2-02d8-4f2b-9233-770ec86e4343	5	Fresh, sweet and also poignant. Explores the dilemma of undocumented immigrants and the brutal deportation system, but also the courage and talent of a teen girl with Filipino heritage struggling to become a country singer/songwriter in Texas. Different and appealing.
/m/yellow_rose	50d9f3a2-02d8-4f2b-9233-770ec86e4343	4	Touching story of Rose, an undocumented Filipina teen, living in Texas. After her mother is picked up by ICE, Rose is left with some difficult choices and circumstances. While trying to navigate life as an illegal immigrant, in fear of being deported, Rose pursues her dream of being a country singer-songwriter, meeting some supportive and caring folks along the way. This understated film is very well acted by the entire cast and though the story is simple it tugs at your heartstrings. I like that the teen romance took a back seat and was just a small facet of the film and there was more focus on the songwriting and the music. which is beautiful and emotionally sung by the actress Eva Noblezada (Rose) and country musician Dale Watson, who also stars in the film (as well as a beautiful Filipino lullaby sung by Lea Salonga.) . Rated PG-13 for a few (authentic and not just for the heck of it) swear words. A beautifully told story IMHO! 5/2021
/m/yellow_rose	50d9f3a2-02d8-4f2b-9233-770ec86e4343	3	The scripting could have been better. It seemed like a first attempt. Mostly, it suffered one major flaw;  given that much of the movie was about singing, there wasn't nearly enough of that in the movie.  But it wasn't terrible.
/m/yellow_rose	50d9f3a2-02d8-4f2b-9233-770ec86e4343	4.5	This movie is full of delicate and beautiful scenes.
/m/yellow_rose	50d9f3a2-02d8-4f2b-9233-770ec86e4343	2.5	This is a unique topic and for that it gets serious credit. There is some poor writing along the way that makes this movie drag. So close to good. Just not quite there. There are many beautiful marks that are hit in this movie. It's the ones that are left hanging that leave you longing.
/m/yellow_rose	50d9f3a2-02d8-4f2b-9233-770ec86e4343	4	When it's not preachy, Yellow Rose is an excellent film.  It tackles a serious issue (Immigration), and combines a coming of age love story and an unlikely friendship.  It's not perfect, but it's genuine.  I cried tears of sadness and tears of joy for a film that is hopeful.  Lots of smiles!  Final Score: 8/10
/m/yellow_rose	50d9f3a2-02d8-4f2b-9233-770ec86e4343	5	This is a beautiful coming of age movie with the twist while making her way.  A surprise appearance by Dale Watson rounds out an excellent cast that makes for a heartwarming story of picking yourself up from tough circumstances
/m/yellow_rose	50d9f3a2-02d8-4f2b-9233-770ec86e4343	3.5	Apart from the irritating mother, this was pretty good.
/m/yellow_rose	50d9f3a2-02d8-4f2b-9233-770ec86e4343	3	Yellow Rose is a movie that holds a lot of promise, and doesn't really ever deliver. I can't shake the feeling (even at the end of the movie) that everyone simply used Rose. The fact that no one seems to want to really help her, and only want her around as long as it benefits them. Not her mother (abandons Rose for Manila), not her "friend" (wants a romantic relationship), not the Aunt (prefers her comfort / abusive husband), not the bar owner (wants cheap labor and worries only about the business after ICE abducts her help), not Dale (wants her as a "muse" as Rose puts it). Only the ICE agent who spots Rose provides her any real help (by not taking her in). What a wasted chance to show that humanity has a good side with such important immigration issues, and that these children especially are vulnerable and deserve someone to advocate for them. As we see Rose age and the movie ends, Rose clearly expects that she will also be deported (despite her defiant song).
/m/yellow_rose	50d9f3a2-02d8-4f2b-9233-770ec86e4343	4	Very tight film, excellently executed from the astute writing to the excellent musical score and cinematography. An engaging and thoughtful telling of a universal struggle by Filipino migrants globally. This essential workforce, that is so often overlooked is spotlighted in a simple and engaging film. Choosing the American state of Texas, and the country music scene as a backdrop, allows the opportunity to showcase the human spirit and dismantle stereotypes of racism and xenophobia; while in this film the enemy is not the people but the system that governs them. Yellow Rose show's that in the most trialing of circumstances, art, music and creativity can sometimes be the only escape hatch to freedom. Bravo to the director and writer, I imagine great things to follow.
/m/american_skin	b10504c5-6fbb-4f01-ab67-f8b101bfc3e5	5	I watched this movie with my 13 year son, it was powerful. We respect the commentary that the police convicted gave. We felt the empathy of the father. The movement at the end was everything. Those racial profiling needs to END.
/m/american_skin	b10504c5-6fbb-4f01-ab67-f8b101bfc3e5	5	Its a great. This is so much truth in it. I love the twist and ending was very unexpected so that blew me away. Im wowed
/m/american_skin	b10504c5-6fbb-4f01-ab67-f8b101bfc3e5	3.5	This film was great. It was refreshing to watch a movie that leaves it's audience not only entertained but also with some food for thought about the ever so delicate topic on the discrimination minorities often face with the police, more specifically the African American.
/m/american_skin	b10504c5-6fbb-4f01-ab67-f8b101bfc3e5	2.5	Too slow at the beginning and nonsensical at the end. Felt like a remake of Samuel Jackson's The Negotiator, made for the social media generation. Holding people at gunpoint to get an apologize does not solve the issues plaguing our society. 5/10
/m/american_skin	b10504c5-6fbb-4f01-ab67-f8b101bfc3e5	5	This was a great and powerful movie that is bring light onto a situation that some americans choose to ignore. I wouldn't change a thing highly recommended.
/m/american_skin	b10504c5-6fbb-4f01-ab67-f8b101bfc3e5	5	I love this movie! It tells the harsh truth about how racists people are. It's my favorite movie of Omari Hardwick
/m/american_skin	b10504c5-6fbb-4f01-ab67-f8b101bfc3e5	2.5	With Spike Lee involved you know what to expect. The story itself could have been edited down to 30 min with no loss.
/m/american_skin	b10504c5-6fbb-4f01-ab67-f8b101bfc3e5	3.5	Adequately produced, long winded, but very powerful. Actor Nate Parker dabbles as a newb filmmaker writing and directing this story, as well as starring in it. It wasn't by any means a top-tier production, but considering he wore many hats with this film, it was still a pleasant viewing experience. His inexperience in directing was a little evident, and his screenplay certainly needed some tweaks, scenes cut shorter, and the pace picked up. But I really liked the format on how he decided to tell the story. The 89 min runtime felt a little longer with the slow pacing, too much preaching, and lots of filler. It could've used more substance, more drama or conflict. Nevertheless, it was very powerful, especially the very end when the news outlets tell their story... literally nailed it. The critics went really hard on this one, nitpicking it too much. Was it a great production? Not even close. Does it need to be seen? Absolutely, and it will still entertain. A solid 7/10 from me.
/m/american_skin	b10504c5-6fbb-4f01-ab67-f8b101bfc3e5	5	Thought-provoking!!! Black Lives Matter vs. The Police & The Judicial System. In truth, the script writers for this movie were too authentic, and I believe that's why it's receiving poor reviews from people who don't want you to watch it (for obvious reasons).
/m/american_skin	b10504c5-6fbb-4f01-ab67-f8b101bfc3e5	5	This movie was phenomenal! It had conversations from both sides. I loved the spin they put on it.  Everyone should see this. The acting was amazing. This film really digs deep.
/m/soul_2020	cae1172d-7bf6-4d2c-9f2d-95ceb23dc0e2	5	It's an incredible movie. Good animation and a good story. Heartfelt.
/m/soul_2020	cae1172d-7bf6-4d2c-9f2d-95ceb23dc0e2	4	best Pixar movie when we are not in the soul world
/m/soul_2020	cae1172d-7bf6-4d2c-9f2d-95ceb23dc0e2	1.5	There used to be a debate about what was the worst Pixar movie ever. The debate is over. It doesn't get any worse than Soul. What starts off as an interesting success story turns into an existential exercise in boredom. It's a CATaclysmic CATastrophy.
/m/soul_2020	cae1172d-7bf6-4d2c-9f2d-95ceb23dc0e2	3.5	Soul made me think and relate with the deep questions it poses and themes it focuses on as the main core of the movie. It's quite a slow-paced movie, sometimes too slow with a rather underwhelming finale.
/m/soul_2020	cae1172d-7bf6-4d2c-9f2d-95ceb23dc0e2	4	The first bit of the movie had me a bit disappointed with unfunny jokes and awkwardly designed characters for a Pixar movie, but soon enough for me to change my mind that this is once again, a beautiful Pixar movie.
/m/soul_2020	cae1172d-7bf6-4d2c-9f2d-95ceb23dc0e2	2.5	I went into this expecting a totally different movie from what it ultimately was, which does happen to me a lot as I try to avoid reading anything about plots before I sit down to watch, but in this case the movie I had hoped it would be was one where Pixar really made a full effort at depicting and celebrating black culture; what I got instead was them sort of brushing up against it without really committing, focusing instead on an ultimately  banal plot about an obnoxious spirit child. They did the token barbershop scenes & the strict mom stuff but included surprisingly few scenes of Joe actually playing his music, scenes that were by far the highlight of the movie to me. All of the Great Beyond/Before stuff was just too farfetched by a mile for me; they worked too hard at removing any references to actual human cultures and tried to include too much, like the far-too-brief visit to the World's Fair-style area. They obviously did a good job with the animation & it's not their worst movie ever (that would be The Good Dinosaur), but a better movie than this felt immensely achievable for them and so this was more disappointing than some other letdowns for me.
/m/soul_2020	cae1172d-7bf6-4d2c-9f2d-95ceb23dc0e2	5	A powerful, life-changing message, beautifully told and illustrated.
/m/soul_2020	cae1172d-7bf6-4d2c-9f2d-95ceb23dc0e2	3	Battles with some interesting concepts to deliver a film that is likely to entertain most families.
/m/soul_2020	cae1172d-7bf6-4d2c-9f2d-95ceb23dc0e2	4.5	While it may become too abstract for its own good at times, Soul delivers on what you expect from a Christmas-release Pixar movie. Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx) is our jazz-obsessed protag who works at an NYC public school. While he seems to find some satisfaction in teaching students music, his dream is to become a jazz-pianist. For some reason, Joe can't be a jazz musician and a full-time teacher — he's less than thrilled at the news of receiving a full-time position, wherein the principal (Cathy Cavadini) even tells him about the increase in pay, the health benefits, the vacation, etc. — you'd think Joe just got fired instead of a raise. A public-school teacher in the city is an excellent job and isn't jazz music, like all music, performed at night? This felt like a contrived way to build conflict between Joe and his mother (Phylicia Rashad). I enjoyed the suddenness of Joe's death — even if we knew it had to happen — and the concept of the "Great Before". The cubist-inspired soul counselors (Richard Ayoade & Alice Braga), who were all named "Jerry" (along with the soul counter "Terry") were created with mesmerizing animation. Terry is the closest thing we get to a villain, but labeling him that would be a stretch. "Choosing your spark" a.k.a. your raison d'être, is a concept I have a lot of feelings about, although, I am on the other side of the spectrum when it comes to one's "destiny," which is a topic for another blog post, I do think finding one's passion(s) is immensely important to mental health and well-being. It gets tough to discuss Soul because of these existential concepts. Feelings are kinda personified (similar to Inside Out), but not as on the nose, which may make this less enjoyable for children, which I still believe is the target demographic for Pixar(?). Where the film excels is showcasing the feeling of "I'm alive!" and that crestfallen feeling of accomplishing something, but not receiving the satisfaction you thought you would. The end of the movie definitely lost me a little. While the "I'm going to live every day to the fullest!" message is nice, I think how we get there was kinda…bland. A deus ex machina (in literal form) and then poof! movie over. I was expecting for Joe and 22 (Tina Fey) to find each other, both in human form — even if it looked like she was headed to Asia, she knew where he lived, as she was him for a day. But that's not what we get. *Side Note* I'm all for having cats NOT die in movies (the amount of abuse towards these creatures in film bothers me), but how exactly did the cat's soul return to Earth, as it was already on the ethereal escalator to the "Great Beyond"? No matter. If you enjoy Pixar movies (i.e. if you have a… soul) you've probably seen this already or will soon. It's not up there with the greats (Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, Toy Story, The Incredibles, Coco, etc.), but Soul is really good.
/m/soul_2020	cae1172d-7bf6-4d2c-9f2d-95ceb23dc0e2	5	A perfect return to form for Pixar, a complete masterpiece.
/m/born_to_be	e2bd5b10-ef29-3e05-ba92-ebb2750eec53	5	We have to challenge ourselves sometimes to learn what we don't know in order to grow and understand.  This documentary feature shows in great detail the process of transitioning and sheds new light on questions often asked, but rarely answered.  It takes courage to make a film like this.  We follow the work of Dr. Jess Ting of the Mount Sinai Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery in New York City.  They serve, exclusively, all transgender and gender non-conforming people and provide access to quality transition-related health and surgical care.  The more you know!  It's also an excellent film that teaches those who want to absorb.  Final Score 10/10
/m/born_to_be	e2bd5b10-ef29-3e05-ba92-ebb2750eec53	2.5	The movie is much more a documentary of the center found at Mount Sinai and the Dr Ting, who led those efforts.  The film itself was a little confusing in moving at times between past and present with the patients they showed. I found the movie also disturbing actually. It is good this center is providing healthcare to the transgender population, but the doctor is carving up patients who desire surgery to look like the opposite gender of their birth and the scenes shown were disturbing.  It would be better that these folks received ongoing counseling for gender dysphoria, Many even go on after surgery and become depressed and suicidal so surgery is not a solution. Dr Ting is walking into dangerous territory by doing what he is doing and soon everyone will want to change some physical aspects to be something else, knowing this is available.  No one will accept who they are anymore.
/m/once_upon_a_river	79fa1619-8b7b-4505-b1b3-fffba43b1992	3.5	IN A NUTSHELL: First-time director Haroula Rose shares a coming-of-age story about a fearless heroine in her drama, based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Bonnie Jo Campbell.  Haroula Rose has a bright future in the film industry.   The film has already won 17 awards in the film festival circuit!   TIPS FOR PARENTS: You see a girl in her underwear and later see her topless A mother walks away from her family. If you have children, assure them you're not going to leave them. You see a dead deer and some other animals that have been shot, along with pelts. A teenager drinks alcohol given to her by a predatory adult and then he "has his way with her." You see blood on a girl's underwear. Profanity and 2 F-bombs. Guns, shooting People die Starved for affection, the heroine is pretty promiscuous You see a visit to an abortion clinic  THEMES: Destiny Infidelity Family Consequences Emotional connection Healing old wounds Dishonesty "You should live how you want." - Margo  (Kenadi DelaCerna) The importance of having good parents around Selfishness   THINGS I LIKED: Kenadi DelaCerna gives a wonderful breakthrough performance as a Native American teenager living in rural Michigan in the 1970s.  She sets off on the river alone to find her estranged mother and meets interesting characters along the way. The director gives us some little details that really help us understand where the teenager's mindset is. Some beautiful cinematography by Charlotte Hornsby. The film is shot with an insightful lens. The sound of the river was outstanding and ever-present.  Kudos to the sound department. Another round of kudos goes to the location management team.  What a fun job that must be. Sign me up! The music was not heavy-handed, offering just a touch of background every now and then. I like the title but think "The River Rose" could have been even more appropriate because I love double-meanings.  THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: There isn't much humor, although there are a few humorous characters that the protagonist meets along the way. It's full of sadness. While the story is about Margo, some viewers will just be bored or depressed by the story. Some viewers won't be satisfied with the ending.  FUNNY LINES:  * "Open your eye!" - Brian says to his friend with an eye patch (Dominic Bogart)  INTERESTING LINES: "You can go to the river to remember or you can go to the river to forget." - Margo (Kenadi DelaCerna)  You can watch my full movie review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.

/m/assassins_2020	56190ced-f6b0-4da6-a05a-bc0d7ed42039	2.5	was pretty invested in first half but the resolution was underwhelming
/m/assassins_2020	56190ced-f6b0-4da6-a05a-bc0d7ed42039	4.5	It's crazy how North Korea could get away with murder and absolutely nothing happens to them. The fact that Kim Jong-Un is that paranoid about his brother somehow taking over the dictatorship is insane and he would kill his own bloodline just to make sure it never happened. I feel bad for the two naive girls who got tricked into committing the assassination, but they honestly Japanese shows do crazy pranks like that so I could see how they could get duped. However why wouldn't they question the so called directors when they commanded the two girls to make sure that they rubbed the liquid down their face into the men's eyes? That right there is considered assault and anybody with common sense should question that. I also wonder if Malaysia and other Asian airports have better cameras and more airport security. That was pretty pathetic how easy the assination was. And I hope they have signs all around the airports warning that "TV pranks" are prohibited and illegal so naive girls trying to make money are not duped again.
/m/assassins_2020	56190ced-f6b0-4da6-a05a-bc0d7ed42039	4	One of the better documentaries I've seen. It contains a lot of good information about the case and also tells the story from the perspective of the two women. The footage, pacing, and interviews were well done, although a few more people linked to the case should have been shown on screen since it was mostly limited to the lawyers, two journalists, and the two women. I initially didn't think they would be stupid enough to believe that they were doing a prank show, but the documentary revealed the manipulation from the North Koreans and the build up of pranks months in advance. I felt sorry for the women by the end and was satisfied with the take-away message.
/m/assassins_2020	56190ced-f6b0-4da6-a05a-bc0d7ed42039	5	A brilliant documentary feature from Ryan White exploring the assassination of the Older half brother of the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.  It's an Un-believable story of two women who kill with a very adept team.  It's Un-real.  It's my favorite doc of 2020.  It's told in a non linear way and it works.  Even of you know a little of this story, the detail White is able to give makes it fly and it's totally worth the watch.  It's a True Crime story come to life!  Final Score: 10/10
/m/assassins_2020	56190ced-f6b0-4da6-a05a-bc0d7ed42039	5	Unfolding the assassination of Kim Jong-nam at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in 2017, this is an exhilaratingly immersing documentary that unnervingly suggests our mortal means of subsistence in a foreign land could be a merciless exploitation in an absolute execution by the North Korea's Kim Dynasty and become objects of sacrifice in maintaining political relations between countries.
/m/assassins_2020	56190ced-f6b0-4da6-a05a-bc0d7ed42039	3.5	Interesting & definitely recommend .......
/m/assassins_2020	56190ced-f6b0-4da6-a05a-bc0d7ed42039	5	A great happy ending in real life of two young girls..dirty political and cold blooded bastard who will do anything for power
/m/assassins_2020	56190ced-f6b0-4da6-a05a-bc0d7ed42039	4	North Korea's Scariest Home Videos -  Film Review: Assassins ★★★★  Anyone who knows me well has heard of my utter obsession with all things North Korea.  Late at night, I can be found diving deep into Korea-Holes on the internet, reading interviews with defectors, clicking on smuggled-out videos of public executions, or watching documentaries about the Hermit Kingdom. My heart goes out to the population made up essentially of 25 million prisoners in their own country. The reports of human rights abuses remain consistent with the tenure of its current "Dear Leader", Kim Jong-un.  The horrors occurring outside of the state-sanctioned tourist routes paint a picture of a ruthless dictator who will stop at nothing to maintain complete control of his citizens. Even his own family members aren't safe. Witness the killing of his uncle as one example.   It's with another murder, of Kim Jong-nam, the leader's half-brother, that acclaimed documentary filmmaker, Ryan White (Good Ol' Freda, The Keepers, The Case Against 8) trained his camera on one of the most jaw-dropping and diabolical public assassinations of modern times. Naturally, I inhaled this film, Assassins, the moment I got my grubby hands on it.   Kim Jong-nam, the oldest child of Kim-Jong-il and thus, the heir apparent to the Kim Dynasty, had been living in exile since 2003. His ousting came as a result of attempting to visit Disneyland Tokyo with his children, although he would later say it was based more on his criticism of the regime.  Either way, in 2017, Kim Jong-nam had a highly toxic chemical agent applied to his face in the Malaysia International Airport's departure hall, which was caught on security camera footage. This brazen act led to his death within an hour.   Shortly thereafter, police arrested two women, strangers to each other, for the assassination. Siti and Doan, Indonesian and Vietnamese immigrants respectively, admitted to being hired to commit the act, but they thought they had participated in a prank video. The two women, financially struggling, had been filming pranks for some time before this fateful day. They claimed they had no idea they had been asked to approach such a high profile target. They thought the chemical agent was a hand lotion they had used in  prior videos. With a trial and the death penalty on the line, I won't spoil what happens next, but suffice it to say, it's evil stuff.    Similar to what happened with Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist murdered at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in 2018, Kim Jong-nam's assassination orders appeared to come from the highest levels of government. Additionally, in both cases, the current U.S. President turned a blind eye, even going so far as to later cozy up to Kim Jong-un and declare they were "in love".   Lost in the shuffle with their lives hanging in the balance, Siti and Doan remain the primary focus of this hugely empathetic film. White exposes the vulnerability of women who move to countries like Malaysia to make a better life for themselves. Both young and vibrant with career aspirations, the pair fell victim to a nefarious group of men who had groomed them for some time. Prosecutors maintained that the women knew exactly what they were doing. White uses a mixture of existing footage, interviews with journalists and lawyers, as well as a generous amount of time spent exploring Siti and Doan's lives. While the details of the case alone make this an edge-of-your-seat viewing experience, White beautifully layers it with the bigger issues of society's treatment of women, immigrants, and of those in power who will sell anybody out to remain in office. As much as I constantly research North Korea, I had forgotten the twists and turns of this particular case, especially the ultimate outcome. White not only uses great skill in relaying those plot points, but he also makes you care deeply for the two women. Able to send a chill down your spine while also reducing you to tears, Assassins, is a suspenseful page-turner, heart tugger, and one of the best documentaries of the year.
/m/love_sarah	666fe5c2-3aec-33c8-8b89-b043c9e443c4	5	Suddenly realized why it was so cuddly and at the same time so refreshing: no one using mobile phones. Lovely that! Tone was well done, navigating a few plot threads that that interwove gently and realistically, and characters lightly developed but enough to seem very real. Kudos for this first time director.
/m/love_sarah	666fe5c2-3aec-33c8-8b89-b043c9e443c4	0.5	None of what the characters do makes sense. It's an interesting concept and should be good but it's just so silly. What a disappointment.
/m/love_sarah	666fe5c2-3aec-33c8-8b89-b043c9e443c4	3.5	Overall, like a freshly-baked cake, Love Sarah is refreshing and delightful. While the film is classed as a drama, it contains an incredibly heartfelt story with the added ingredients of both humour and mystery. Performances are also fantastic, and I felt the leading ladies had beautiful chemistry together. All these ingredients will make the movie lover crave another slice as the credits roll - Walkden Entertainment
/m/love_sarah	666fe5c2-3aec-33c8-8b89-b043c9e443c4	0.5	Weak, shallow and pointless. The characters were unbelievable and the story pathetic.
/m/love_sarah	666fe5c2-3aec-33c8-8b89-b043c9e443c4	3	A sweet, mostly light-hearted drama. Acting is good and the story is engaging. Nicely paced and undemanding, it is uplifting even as it explores issues of grief, resilience, and diversity. Avoids going too deep or being too confronting.
/m/love_sarah	666fe5c2-3aec-33c8-8b89-b043c9e443c4	5	If you're looking for a feel good, classic kind of film, this is it. Sweet storyline with moments of reflection (and tears!). Really enjoyed it.
/m/love_sarah	666fe5c2-3aec-33c8-8b89-b043c9e443c4	2	Awful acting ,very thin plot line. Why did they bother?
/m/mlk_fbi	6f7752c9-fb94-43c0-bbd4-51a4a4b5b7fa	2.5	Mixed feelings on this but its key strength is the archival footage detailing MLK's life. The FBI don't come across at all well but at least we see why - the apparently revered J Edgar Hoover was a relentless decryer of any attempts from the civil rights movement to gain recognition. In context of the period it's understandable but from a modern perspective it's appalling how the colour of a man's skin marked him as a dissident simply for trying to gain equality.  At least I got the chance to see and hear MLK in action all in one documentary. I would like to see this film become part of any critical race theory education package.
/m/mlk_fbi	6f7752c9-fb94-43c0-bbd4-51a4a4b5b7fa	3.5	Extremely slow and thorough and this documentary sometimes gets caught chasing its own tail, but overall this is an enlightening look at how bad our government is in the United States.  The FBI was dirty, no surprise there, but how dirty will blow your mind.  While I enjoyed this film, it was distracting for me to not see any talking heads.  The decision to only include archive footage and audio from people interviewed recently was odd.  Plenty to dig into with this one!  Final Score: 7.4/10
/m/mlk_fbi	6f7752c9-fb94-43c0-bbd4-51a4a4b5b7fa	1	Maybe the most boring documentary ever made. No new information. Exhaustingly long. Dreadfully bad. They uncover NOTHING new. How is this not universally panned? So bad.
/m/mlk_fbi	6f7752c9-fb94-43c0-bbd4-51a4a4b5b7fa	3.5	"Looking at the FBI campaigns against King, the Black Panther party, and many other people I think there's a core component to this that really is structural and functional. People hold these attitudes and we focus on J. Edgar Hoover's own particular history and person, but I think that these are attitudes that have been core to how the racial order operates in the U.S.  What helped motivate these campaigns was the real fear that black people could undermine the way the country wanted to see itself. And this manifested itself not only in the targeting of leaders and the people that were visible, but of ordinary people. So, this core fear and aggression toward African Americans has a lot to do with white people's own conception of themselves and black people forcing a reckoning with the violence of the American past."  Hot. Damn.
/m/mlk_fbi	6f7752c9-fb94-43c0-bbd4-51a4a4b5b7fa	3.5	Good but a bit of a disappointment - I don't think I really learned anything..... and what was with the dozen plus clips from old Hollywood movies?
/m/mlk_fbi	6f7752c9-fb94-43c0-bbd4-51a4a4b5b7fa	5	Sobering look at how those who control our government will go to eliminate a threat to the status quo benefitting those with power
/m/mlk_fbi	6f7752c9-fb94-43c0-bbd4-51a4a4b5b7fa	1	Horrible use of film who claims the focus was to "shame" the FBI for filming Dr. King but whose real intent was to cast shade/doubt on Dr. Martin Luther King's legacy. An abomination and disgrace to documentaries worldwide. Have some class, talk about good things in people and try it again! If we went after everything the writers of the film did that was bad, I'm sure we could easily frame a ludicrous picture of them as well. I'm requesting a refund.
/m/mlk_fbi	6f7752c9-fb94-43c0-bbd4-51a4a4b5b7fa	3.5	Very informative, especially with all the political climate these days. I live documentaries anyways.
/m/mlk_fbi	6f7752c9-fb94-43c0-bbd4-51a4a4b5b7fa	3.5	i think that the response of some tackily-dressed southern white woman to the question, 'what do you think of martin luther king?' was,  'well, i don't care for him. he's too bossy. thinks he's too smart.' pretty much sums it up...
/m/mlk_fbi	6f7752c9-fb94-43c0-bbd4-51a4a4b5b7fa	5	When we turn our progressive leaders into Gods or demigods, and pretend they have no flaws... we ignore their humanity.  "Respectability Politics" (which makes marginalized people into squeaky clean, mainstream people - rather than humans with flaws) have forced us to make our leaders into perfect Supreme Gods.    Turning our progressive leaders into gods, allows the power structures (who want to maintain the status-quo) to partake in clandestine activities that wish to expose the flaws of our progressive leaders, in order to tear them down.    The FBI wiretapped MLK and they eavesdropped on him and found his flaws.  They then tried to use Martin Luther King Jr.'s flaws against him.  They did everything to destroy his character and the progressive movement he represented.   This is not an excuse of MLK's flaws --- anyone saying that this documentary is trying to excuse MLK's flaws is twisting things around and not paying attention.  We all have flaws -- none of us are perfect.  That is the point.  But when a person's flaws are used to "cancel" that person out (whether the left or the right does it) it is ugly.    In this instance, the FBI tried to do that to King, and this documentary dives into the history.   These are the things we are not taught in school.  MLK wasn't perfect. Gandhi wasn't perfect. Malcom X wasn't perfect.  No one is.    This documentary is a reminder that each one of us, even with deep flaws and imperfections, must still do the work to make the world a better place.  And the ones who try to expose our flaws -- they do it because they have their own flaws that they don't want us to see.    The FBI is a deeply flawed organization.  J. Edgard Hoover, its leader, was also flawed.  If you want to understand how power structures abuse their authority, I recommend this powerful documentary that takes a critical look into how the FBI (one of America's main power structure groups) did everything it could to stop Black leaders, communist leaders and anti-war activists.    This is a critical look into America's overall right-wing history that tries to damage the character of leftwing, progressive leaders.  If you work for the FBI -- (or any police group -- or the CIA --- or any group like that) then that is even more reason for you to watch this documentary.  The only way to make the world a better place is by not perpetuating the abuse, by breaking the cycle.
/m/shadow_in_the_cloud	95e19466-a0e1-4255-87f2-6e4f86bf3625	3	One of the most weird and unique films that I have ever seen and I honestly don't know how to feel about it.
/m/shadow_in_the_cloud	95e19466-a0e1-4255-87f2-6e4f86bf3625	1	The visuals are nice But the movie spends so much time trying to be everything, that it ends up being nothing. Just semi-mindless plot points thrown at the audience over and over. This whole movie legit feels like a first draft, and everyone who wrote it was stoned out of their gourd.
/m/shadow_in_the_cloud	95e19466-a0e1-4255-87f2-6e4f86bf3625	1.5	I can't believe I sat through the entire movie as most of the film is from a small gunner seat.  I did like that the plot was a little crazy.
/m/shadow_in_the_cloud	95e19466-a0e1-4255-87f2-6e4f86bf3625	3.5	It's weird and wacky with a gremlin and gunfire and yes you can pick it apart but if you just sit back and go with it, it's fun.
/m/shadow_in_the_cloud	95e19466-a0e1-4255-87f2-6e4f86bf3625	0.5	Terrible really really terrible. Low rent script with shitty dialogue and enough derogatory references to women that were completely unnecessary. Supposedly set in 1943 but wardrobe sucked as well. I really suffered through this one. At least the ‘Twilight Zone', episode about the gremlin was a bit fun, this by comparison was just crap. Waste of New Zealand Film industry funding.
/m/shadow_in_the_cloud	95e19466-a0e1-4255-87f2-6e4f86bf3625	2	Two stars as this movie should be watched as a comedy only.   Spoilers:  A punch on with a gremlin, babies, even a marriage proposal... like.... wtf did I just watch.

/m/ten_minutes_to_midnight	f0cce3e3-5343-31d7-92b1-2fdbb04647aa	1.5	Oof. That was a tough watch. Just a clusterfart of concepts and situations. My girl and I both looked at eachother at the end and said we just wasted life on this thing. No excitement. No laughs. No sadness. Just an annoying movie.
/m/ten_minutes_to_midnight	f0cce3e3-5343-31d7-92b1-2fdbb04647aa	3	I'm not sure what some of the quasi-philosophical stuff was, but all in all it worked a little more than it didn't.
/m/ten_minutes_to_midnight	f0cce3e3-5343-31d7-92b1-2fdbb04647aa	3.5	Was kinda all over the place and nonsensical but the acting was good especially the character player Amy during her decent into madness 3.3
/m/ten_minutes_to_midnight	f0cce3e3-5343-31d7-92b1-2fdbb04647aa	3.5	Bloomquist seems to be both utilizing ‘80s nostalgia and criticizing it. It's a nihilistic little film that also has a lot of hope. It's a cynical, bitter film that also has a big, pulsating heart. It'll rip that heart out and drink its fluids, but that's the fun of Ten Minutes to Midnight. Without the restrictions that sometimes come with a big studio and budget, Bloomquist has crafted something unique. From the opening moments to the abstract ending, Ten Minutes to Midnight is never anything less than wild.   Full review on Back Lot 605:  https://backlot605.com/ten-minutes-to-midnight-review/
/m/ten_minutes_to_midnight	f0cce3e3-5343-31d7-92b1-2fdbb04647aa	5	Ten Minutes to Midnight introduces you to Amy Marlowe played by the effervescent Caroline Williams as the film's protagonist and Amy's core group of colleagues, friends and partners at a local radio station where she has had a thirty-year career and successful late night radio program. On the night where she receives unexpected news signaling an end to her career she ironically gets bitten by a bat..a rabid/vampire bat at the same time. Using the legends of Dracula and vampire history as symbols for youth and immortality, the plot weaves through Amy's past and present struggle with an end to a career, a change in life and a need to feel fulfilled that can only come within. The characters change faces but not names or roles showing Amy's worth having to come from within and the monster of time finding her before the vampire could. The movie weaves authentic horror with raw human emotion and themes that pulls at your heartstrings while also honoring the genre and the legendary scream queen's horror roots and heart. I recommend watching and asking yourself, are you happy where you are? where you've come from? What memory will you leave behind? And keep an eye out for any monsters while you're at it.
/m/ten_minutes_to_midnight	f0cce3e3-5343-31d7-92b1-2fdbb04647aa	3	It takes a lot for me to mention a horror film's lack of subtlety — I'm usually more inclined to let genre films have their typical flaws and not even mention it.     In this case, however, it felt like it was so overtly being hammered into your brain from the opening scene all the way to the credits. I really enjoyed long stretches of this movie, and I thought the performances were absolutely amazing. If only the writer/director had had a *little bit more focus* this film would've really shifted into a higher gear, which is the ultimate feeling you're left with by the end. There were so many ways this could've really gone for broke by making the majority — if not all — of the film a disorienting assault on our notions of objectivity & certainty. But instead we ultimately see every single narrative beat a mile away...which is just unfortunate.      The most grave sin one can commit in a horror movie is being predictable, (or at least that's my major gripe with most horror movies made in the last 20 years or so). Horror *is* the best genre in all of fiction. Straight up. So why not lean in to it? Why would you want to tell a story in a way that kneecaps the impact of your film's central theme? It wouldn't have been difficult to make small changes that bring this up another notch. sigh.
/m/ten_minutes_to_midnight	f0cce3e3-5343-31d7-92b1-2fdbb04647aa	3	The movie had lot of twists and turns.  I wasn't sure how much they had to do with the plot but it had some interesting insights into Vampirism.
/m/ten_minutes_to_midnight	f0cce3e3-5343-31d7-92b1-2fdbb04647aa	4	Another dark and twisty ride from the Bloomquist brothers. Throughout the film, you'll find yourself laughing, slightly confused, and at times, completely grossed out. Fantastic special effects and mind-bending twists makes this spin on a creature feature a solid horror film.
/m/ten_minutes_to_midnight	f0cce3e3-5343-31d7-92b1-2fdbb04647aa	5	Highly recommend. The performances are all extremely well done by extremely talented actors. Caroline Williams proves to be the perfect lead as she pulls you in for this trip through an emotion-filled, unpredictable, and absolutely brutal night. Each step she takes, you take with her. All her dread and pain, you go through it as well. Each supporting character is integral to the story and fleshed out which only enhances the intensity along with the stunning visuals and gore. This film has a great style to it with bold colors and heavy music which matches up perfectly with a modern vampire storyline filled with social commentary. Definitely worth the watch!
/m/ten_minutes_to_midnight	f0cce3e3-5343-31d7-92b1-2fdbb04647aa	1	Hated it waste of time
/m/i_am_lisa	c4abb7e8-17d0-4f11-846b-1c0de2fc31e0	0.5	Stupid plot terrible script how could any critic like this movie thankfully it was free to watch.
/m/i_am_lisa	c4abb7e8-17d0-4f11-846b-1c0de2fc31e0	2	I can't tell if the actors were bad, or they were just given horrible dialog and directed to execute it poorly. I have trouble trying to pin it on the poor acting soly. The general idea behind the story was good and I watched it because I liked the trailer,  but within a few minutes of starting the it begins to go south. I almost like it for being bad but I can't tell. It's so obvious they had a good concept with all the wrong people involved.
/m/i_am_lisa	c4abb7e8-17d0-4f11-846b-1c0de2fc31e0	3	Good story, just not great acting or execution
/m/i_am_lisa	c4abb7e8-17d0-4f11-846b-1c0de2fc31e0	0.5	Even for a low budget indy movie, I Am Lisa was appalling.  From the slower than molasses pacing to the lack of character motivation, I found this movie definitely falls short. It's not even worth being classified as a b-movie.  In fact, this was a an d-movie if I am being generous.  Not worth the time spent watching the film. Also, this movie could have benefitted from good sound-editing as even the most violent portions are bad due to the lack of sound effects.
/m/i_am_lisa	c4abb7e8-17d0-4f11-846b-1c0de2fc31e0	1	This is unworthy of one star, but I added a half due to it obviously being super low budget.  There is no reason this should have above a 90% on RT.  The only reason it does is due to it being a primarily female cast.  This is obvious by the content of the reviews. They didn't watch the movie when they say words like "compelling" as there is nothing remotely compelling about this. It is boring with bad acting and a German Shepard as a wolf. The transformation is wicked though. Just put your head down and plop on a mask and wow ..you are a werewolf. Scary! Terrible acting, dialogue and story. The only revenge in this movie is wanting to throw a tomato at the screen after the less than climatic ending. RT your reviews are a joke.
/m/i_am_lisa	c4abb7e8-17d0-4f11-846b-1c0de2fc31e0	4.5	Chill werewolf story.  Reminds me of It Follows, kind of a intellectual indie vibe.  I really liked it.
/m/i_am_lisa	c4abb7e8-17d0-4f11-846b-1c0de2fc31e0	4	Revenge is sweet but at what cost? Lisa lives in a small town operating a book store, after her grandmother dies she comes back after doing a tour overseas  The local girls have it out for her leaving in the first place  But the sherif in charge is about as corrupt as they come  One day she and her deputies brutally attack Lisa leaving her to lick her wounds  Then a werewolf stalks her in the woods biting her  She slowly goes through a scary transformation able to gain superstrength and bloodlust against all those whom have wronged her  But the curse may be erasing all that's good about Lisa  Kristen Vaganos plays the part very well going from meek/shy to strong/vicious and confident  There's terrific gore and it's nice to have an all-female cast go head-to-head rather than making the men always pay in these kinds of scenarios  Even troubled women can be as monstrous as the supernatural creatures  It's got a smooth score to go with too  It's very intellectual and quite a vibrant journey into female empowerment meets revenge werewolf flick  This narrative is tired and worn out but with exceptional performances and a cool lore it stands above  More compelling and complex horror stories lead by women should be frequent including the queer folk whilst being told
/m/i_am_lisa	c4abb7e8-17d0-4f11-846b-1c0de2fc31e0	1	I can see how viewers enjoy a revenge story, but the writing was poorly done, as well as the acting and general performance. Quite "basic." I do not recommend this title at all for seasoned horror film viewers
/m/i_am_lisa	c4abb7e8-17d0-4f11-846b-1c0de2fc31e0	3	It was a decent horror movie.
/m/i_am_lisa	c4abb7e8-17d0-4f11-846b-1c0de2fc31e0	1.5	Hilarious B movie, no transformation scene though very disappointing
/m/shortcut_2020	1af79e24-f513-34c6-9321-a8f9ac8c7c33	1	This movie had potential if they stuck with the tone from the trailer and the first 20 minutes. Yes, the acting was subpar, but the plot was rushed and there was ambiguity feelings between the characters.
/m/shortcut_2020	1af79e24-f513-34c6-9321-a8f9ac8c7c33	1	Not that great. First part of the movie was interesting and had a good premise, in addition to this it was shot very well. Second half of the movie was very boring and not scary or interesting. The disappointing thing is that the movie had potential but failed to deliver. A good watch if you are 10 years old perhaps.
/m/shortcut_2020	1af79e24-f513-34c6-9321-a8f9ac8c7c33	1	Terrible acting, mediocre plot, sickening cinematography. You know how there's good bad movies? Well this was just plain bad.
/m/shortcut_2020	1af79e24-f513-34c6-9321-a8f9ac8c7c33	1	Those were some dumb kids. To say the story is farfetched and illogical is an understatement. The kids endure 3 traumatic experiences. First they're terrified, ten minutes later they're making jokes, flirting, and finding their way through a pitch dark labyrinth in which a demonic vampire like creature is lurking. That dropped the ominous tone and went elsewhere. The director should have kept them in a panic, it would have  made more sense. Then, instead of fleeing, they stay, then cry because they're scared. The narration and overall story is like an IT wannabe. They could have done a lot here but failed.
/m/shortcut_2020	1af79e24-f513-34c6-9321-a8f9ac8c7c33	0.5	This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Brits that can't act? That's a new one. And the effects are ridiculously bad. The creature has a mouth it can barely open, much less attack and kill people with. Here, I'm gonna gnaw on your fingers for a few, see if I can get a grip. And of course it has the requisite greenish skin and claws that are basically Halloween store fare. And there are four or five against this stupid, shambling thing, and there is detritus all over the place. Why don't they grab some of it and beat the thing to death, ram a pole into its guts? A no-budget, no-acting, no story, nonsensical nothing.
/m/shortcut_2020	1af79e24-f513-34c6-9321-a8f9ac8c7c33	1.5	When did RT stop allowing you to sort by user score?  Was it after Dave Chappelle's special?  I'm guessing.
/m/shortcut_2020	1af79e24-f513-34c6-9321-a8f9ac8c7c33	2.5	Nada nuevo en el horizonte, pero el cast está lo suficientemente bien como para hacerse digerible. La realización y edición no tanto...
/m/shortcut_2020	1af79e24-f513-34c6-9321-a8f9ac8c7c33	4	I enjoyed it but my friend didn’t. She doesn’t like horror. Lol
/m/shortcut_2020	1af79e24-f513-34c6-9321-a8f9ac8c7c33	0.5	Absolutely the dumbest movie I’ve ever watched.  This was a compilation of multiple thriller movies of the past, but on a very cheap level.
/m/shortcut_2020	1af79e24-f513-34c6-9321-a8f9ac8c7c33	0.5	Horrible movie. Do not go watch it. Waste of time and money.
/m/girl_2020	99b253fb-f39e-4c68-a04c-4da30f264893	3	Pretty standard stuff. Girl returns to small town, law enforcement is corrupt, secret family history and heroine has to defeat all the bad guys by herself.  Belle Thorne is no great actress and this script doesn't push her in any way. If you're just trying to kill some time, turn this on and fast forward to the action scenes. They are about average and there's really no plot to keep up with.
/m/girl_2020	99b253fb-f39e-4c68-a04c-4da30f264893	1	Drink every time they say daddy
/m/girl_2020	99b253fb-f39e-4c68-a04c-4da30f264893	2	I found Rourke's botched plastic surgery disturbing & distracting. Enjoyed the movie insofar as it passed the time
/m/girl_2020	99b253fb-f39e-4c68-a04c-4da30f264893	3	simple plot, bit weird, acting was ok.
/m/girl_2020	99b253fb-f39e-4c68-a04c-4da30f264893	3	i didn't think this was a bad watch at all; i simultaneously did & didn't like Bella's character for some reason... i can't put my finger on what it was about her, but i do think she played the roll well. i didn't see the plot twist coming so that was refreshing. i'm not sure i'd go out of my way to recommend it, but i'm not sad i watched it.
/m/girl_2020	99b253fb-f39e-4c68-a04c-4da30f264893	1	Sometimes you can just tell that a movie was written, directed and produced by men. Did not enjoy!
/m/girl_2020	99b253fb-f39e-4c68-a04c-4da30f264893	3	This could have been better with a little more focus on the main themes. They brought up a few but I'm still curious as to what they really wanted me to learn. However the story is pretty good and has a nice little change of direction. Full review below:  I'm listening to Mostly Low Budget Movie Reviews with Clarence | HULU review: Girl on Podbean, check it out! https://www.podbean.com/ea/pb-6gdzd-10345d5
/m/girl_2020	99b253fb-f39e-4c68-a04c-4da30f264893	2	Boringly bad and mostly badly written and at times overracted by its leading men and supporting cast. The directing has some to give and Bella Thorne is surprisingly better than anywhere else before but by the time you realize this you're already beyond boredom and unforgiveness for what's happening.
/m/girl_2020	99b253fb-f39e-4c68-a04c-4da30f264893	3.5	Atmospheric, moody, good character actors, better than expected.  Who can't like Mickey Rourke, he's the perfect evil sheriff.  And the director/writer (Faust) makes for an admirable creep as well.
/m/girl_2020	99b253fb-f39e-4c68-a04c-4da30f264893	2.5	The material isn't awful, but it's also not particularly good enough to overcome a B cast. Between Bella Thorne who can't act and Mickey Rourke who refuses to act, Girl is unable to transcend mediocrity.
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	3.5	Another fun continuation to this low-budget, but impressive looking sci-fi/action series. It doesn't add much new to the story, but it's a good time. It's funny how much the two sequels surpass the original, when that's the one that had soo much potential...
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	2.5	A low budget sci-fi film that tries to be bolder than it can and bring some importance to itself even though it has overblown action sequences that look more terrible than cool and literally throws away its plot into the basic pile. The acting is decent and works for the fans of this franchise but it just muddled up in a mildy entertaining mess.
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	4	Saw previous 2 movies of this triad. The trailers looked good CGI wise. Although I was a bit septic in the beginning, due to episode 1 & 2, I gave it a shot. Bought the Blu ray and watched.  The characters are ok. Acting was above average. The main female character was good in my opinion. Facial expressions are in sync with the situation. Sometimes the acting is not according to expectations, not because of the actor, but how the director is allowing certain scenes to be processed. For instance, the scene with the female doctor teaching a girl to shoot. She just learned to shoot and hardly had any trouble gunning down aliens, who supposed to be ruthless. In my opinion that could be dramatized a little bit more, to make it more believable. Owens (older guy) was acting nicely, and his fighting techniques are good, did not see that coming. Some characters have relationships and when something happens to the other I expected a bit of emotions there, but that was not present. And and some moments there were emotions, like the part where one character could not continue and had to left behind. That part was a bit too far stretched, should have kept it short and having danger arriving fast. Then it would be more dramatic and the drama, tears, etc would have been in a better setting.  The added graphics are pretty good. I am a fan of CGI, as it makes things possible that are normally difficult to do in  real life. without comparing with Top A films, This movies deserves a 7/10 for CGI.  Movie props, The arm attached blade for our Heroine is a bit too bulky for my taste. If they added CGI effect like glow it it, that would be nice.  The aliens are dressed in suites that are created as one piece of mold of plastic. Details are not bad, but I sense no weight when their feet touch the ground, as they are weightless.   At one of the scenes when our main Heroine was locked into the room with another person, I was thinking, that it was planned and something was going to happen, but alas nothing earth chattering. some scenes created an expectation that something is going to happen, but then nothing happens. a bit of a let down. Or it is just me to expect too many things.  The story is ok, with twists thank you. It was not entirely transparent and predictable all the way.    Would I see skylines 4 if there were one? Yes, enjoyed the movie. I don't get it when people give it a mere 1 star. Did they really looked at the movie and tried to enjoy it. or was it a comparison to Marvel movies? Budget wise Skylines is a much lower budget. And Europe , I am sorry, Great britain I mean, is doing pretty well in the world of movies. Hope they continue creating better and better CGI movies. Bring Skylines 4 please, love to see the characters and the heroine again. Cheers. I own many many movies. This one is going into my Blu-ray shelf.
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	0.5	Some of the worst acting I've ever seen, turned off movie half way through.
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	3	It might have helped if I'd seen the two previous films; however, as a standalone film this was very weak indeed. I ended up fast forwarding a lot of the middle section as it was boring.
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	2	A waste of time unless all you want are mediocre special effects.
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	3.5	so, this took me a couple tries to finish.  Something about the middle made me fall asleep so many times.  A bit of a disappointment considering I really enjoyed the 2nd film but it's still a nice ending to a somewhat impressive alien trilogy
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	2	Not a good watch, won't watch again, and can't recommend.  I was so excited to see Lindsey Morgan (Raven, "The 100") in a thing, and a cool looking alien dystopian thing at that.  They almost immediate thrashed my dreams.  Apparently there is an entirely "better" movie that we skipped to get to this one, and even that one was pretty odd.  Ripping brains out of human heads to use as bio PCs for alien androids is just odd.  It's not good, but it's not really that bad, just weird.  The movie we do get is more of a alien fantasy story as opposed to the typical science fiction story with psychic/super powers, unnecessary and awkward aliens that only add subtitles.  It sort of becomes "The Matrix" after a bit, but just a lot stranger feeling.
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	0.5	The initial opening to the movie was bland, with a plain and prosaic storyline. There was no need for most film characters, as there was no other purpose and no story arc for the remaining characters. Other characters were too evident in their goals to the "bad guy" plot. The protagonists' character development was vague at best, and at worst, the characters were perceived by the audience as dull and confusing. This was mainly because of the confusing and obvious plot twists. Additionally, there were too many plot holes that could have been solved more straightforwardly. Overall this is not a movie I would recommend to other audiences to a great extent.
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	3.5	I've seen all three; this is by far the best. If you like sci-fi FX and can tolerate sci-fi tropes, this is kind of Tomb Raider in Space.  The female hero's journey works for me.   Writing and acting is a few notches above TV movie, except physical sets and VFX which are close to AAA.  The making-of feature reinforces the impression morale on set was high, always a good foundation for a fun watch.
/m/hunter_hunter	0fb982c1-35e8-38d9-919c-9cf6bce56726	3.5	It's a creepy movie that those who enjoy slow-burners will appreciate for its atmosphere, plot and solid performances. It is well-crafted technically and in general it's on a more serious tone save, perhaps, its ending, which some might find controversial, in whose number I am.
/m/hunter_hunter	0fb982c1-35e8-38d9-919c-9cf6bce56726	4	This was a good movie with a good plot.  Sure it could be a little better in some areas...the end it quite a jump for the character and the movie as a whole in terms of the Horror aspect or Gore.  Maybe a little more upfront would prepare you for the final shot.   Don't want to give up the plot so but overall a thoughtful interesting movie.
/m/hunter_hunter	0fb982c1-35e8-38d9-919c-9cf6bce56726	3.5	I absolutely love bleak endings
/m/hunter_hunter	0fb982c1-35e8-38d9-919c-9cf6bce56726	2	I liked the character development and found the plot compelling, but the ending was so gratuitously horrific that it overwhelmed any of the good qualities in the film. Also, what is this movie supposed to be about on a thematic level? There was no real point that I could see.
/m/hunter_hunter	0fb982c1-35e8-38d9-919c-9cf6bce56726	1	False Advertising.  Movie advertised as a killer animal movie, but isn't.  It's a serial killer movie.  There's a line between twist and false advertising and I believe this falls into the latter.  I went into this wanting a creature feature and got people killing people.  Would rate higher if I'd gone into this looking for a serial killer, I guess.  Loses all the points for false advertising.
/m/hunter_hunter	0fb982c1-35e8-38d9-919c-9cf6bce56726	2.5	Spoilers: when he finds a bunch of murdered people in the woods and don't immediately contact the police it makes it a very very bad start. It doesn't matter how remote you are, there's always a way to contact people.
/m/hunter_hunter	0fb982c1-35e8-38d9-919c-9cf6bce56726	0.5	Ruining the holy title of hunterxhunter for this aweful, and i'm not even exaggerating, AWEFUL MOVIE. a freaking waste of time.
/m/hunter_hunter	0fb982c1-35e8-38d9-919c-9cf6bce56726	5	It is so often that a movie is made with famous actors, a multi-million dollar budget, state-of-the-art effects, and a major studio's backing to all fall FLAT with an unworthy story. But this movie however puts all of them to SHAME! I thought it was going to be bad. But despite lesser-known actors, a low budget, and little advertising this movie is finally a story WORTH TELLING! Captivating. Interesting. Highly recommend!
/m/hunter_hunter	0fb982c1-35e8-38d9-919c-9cf6bce56726	2.5	Meh, it was on the border between meh and bad. I didn't care for the characters at all and it had a very bleak ending which I don't mind but everything leading up to the ending lacked substance.
/m/hunter_hunter	0fb982c1-35e8-38d9-919c-9cf6bce56726	0.5	Disclaimer: I'm going to spoil this real quick so you don't waste an hour and a half of your time! 1. THIS MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT A PSYCHO WOLF  -  It should be, cause that would be awesome and was why we chose it  -  I should be allowed to sue for the false advertising wizardry in the trailer  - It is exactly who you think it is after watching for 30 minutes. 2. Now that you understand that you can simply move on. For my own sanity, I am going to vent because this movie has 'slow burn'ed its crappiness into my brain. How are critics allowed to be certified on here after giving this 94 percent??!!!  - Quickly, I give props to the actors because they weren't bad given their limitations.  - Other than the actors and maybe cinematographer, everyone else involved in this should never make a movie again and/or be checked into a mental hospital.   THE STORY:  - A man, his wife, and their 13 yo daughter live in the boonies and HUNT FOR SUSTENANCE AND I GUESS TRAP FOR MONEY IN THE 21st CENTURY??  (just stop right there.) - They live in a crap little cabin with an outhouse for tanning (that's important later) but no chicken coop, garden or any other system that might be nice for a family living off the land in the modern world. - We find out early on the wife is unhappy because obviously, this is a stupid situation, especially with a 13yo daughter. They take the effort to show the wife doesn't know words like 'rampant' and I guess they can't count well? So they have no other option than to stay in the woods? rather than taking their working truck and moving away because they're uneducated? - Anyways man is gruff and likes life rough! He keeps his small family here and says he'll deal with the wolf problem himself (we're still thinking this is about a big bad wolf). Hunter man goes out to trap wolf and takes daughter with him because she says shes smart, but she has to walk back...alone...as soon as they run into tracks... (sounds good).  - They go out and find wolf. Girl and Wife are alone away from cabin (scary). Man howls and tracks wolf. Man finds wolf. Man has wolf in sniper scope (btw they have like repeaters from the 1890s which seems weird for a family living off hunting). WOLF HAS HUMAN ARM IN JAWS!!!! - I guess this last part surprises man so he misses?? or just wings it?? Anyways wolf escapes expert hunter man and he continues to track. He tracks it into the woods, where he finds a woman tied to a tree and other naked women dead around (I don't think wolves can tie people up...) - He goes back home visibly shaken, and proceeds to tell the two important women in his lives.... ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT THE DEAD WOMEN IN THEIR BACKYARD??? Big tough man says 'I go hunt wolf by myself even if I stay out all night' *smokes stog* - Hunter man leaves two women at the cabin with the shittier repeater and goes out to I guess kill the serial killer in the woods whos obviously murdered several people. - The next 30 minutes show the: child who claimed to be smart doesn't understand why a wolf would poop a ring, the wife living out in the wilderness over 13 years wasn't shown how to skin a deer by her sexist partner, the child who grew up in the wilderness won't eat a baby deer, and of course the husband is at this point definitely dead. Ooh and the wolf shows up and runs away from the two women... NOICE!  - At this point I am getting tired, but I am doing a service to anyone who at least reads the first couple sentences of this review. Please god do not waste your time. If you feel the need, I am doing a pretty decent job giving you the run down and I truly believe reading this is better and shorter than watching that movie.  - Ok now the woman is desperate cause her husband is gone, and he's such a chauvinist that he obviously didn't even teach the women he forced to live with him how to hunt. They get in their working truck and drive to the local municipal outpost manned by two dumb*** park rangers i guess???  - They show them the ring from the wolf poop and talk about their missing husband. The rangers I guess have never met these people and say they're not even allowed to live out there because of the *enter generic land law*. Filing a missing person's report would cause them to lose their oh so precious cabin, despite the fact they said they have another cabin somewhere, and I guess it really is important cause they don't file a missing person's report for their ***hole hunterman.  - They leave and go back to cabin. Meanwhile, parkranger 1 is dealing with some rich family vacationing in the same woods (and oh they're so bad cause they don't care about bears and the corruptions of modern society are obviously why the main family is right to live out in the woods). Anyways, he drives past an abandoned car near the dead bodies in the woods once, then a second time to get out and investigaaaaa..... no no he just gives them a ticket.  - Back to the women. They are obviously struggling. Their small dog has been killed and 13 yo girl who grew up hunting is too fragile to know i guess. Anyways the mom gets woken up by the girl cause she hears the dog outside. Plot TWIST ITS THE WOLF! No just kidding its an injured man whom we haven't seen before (no...really... its that simple).  - She drags him back in, heals him with valuable medical supplies, and allows him to regain consciousness INSTEAD OF PLACING THE STRANGE MAN WITH NO IDEA IN THE BOONIES OUT IN THE OUTHOUSE THEY HAVE FOR TANNING. Ok now imma just run through it cause most of the bs is done and at this point you know what happens.  - Man wakes up. Wife says we take u to truck and to hospital. Man says naaah not really feeling it. Wife says ok makes sense.  - They're still worried about wolf (ya they beat this horse way after it was dead) so they light a fire, and set traps to Lure it? Or to get food? I really don't know at this point.  - Wife puts strange man in her bed. She leaves, and this is why I would bet my life this was written by a man, SHE LEAVES HER FRAGILE 13 YEAR OLD IN THE CABIN WITH A STRANGE MAN AND GOES TO CHECK THE TRAPS WITH THE ONLY REMAINING GUN..... LET THAT SIT..... LET IT KEEP SITTING......YA NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY IM MAD. - Wife finds bunny in trap. Wife cries while killing bunny.... Wife checks in on husbands walkie. Randomly, husbands walkie responds within ear shot. She turns and walks ten yards to find husband dead by a gunshot or a blow to the head??? and maybe the wolf is in a bag by his side its kinda unclear.  - Wife suddenly realizes, OH maybe it WASNT A GOOD IDEA TO LEAVE MY CHILD UNARMED IN A CABIN WITH A STRANGE MAN.. - Wife runs back and looks at man through window with her gun, he is awake and still in bed, but she does not shoot him. Wife walks into cabin and goes into daughters room. Daughter suddenly has sleep apnea. Wife backs out of room and man is behind door cause he is ninja. Man chokes out wife with gun. Daughter wakes up and instead of fighting yells Stop to the man choking out her mom.  - Ok I'm done i cant do this anymore, I'm so drained, if you don't want to end up like me don't watch. The daughters dead, the wife wakes up from choking and incapacitates him. The twist the critics are raving about is that she uses her new found tanning skills to skin the man alive or some fucked up shit. Cops who finally found dead bodies cause park ranger figured it out find her covered in blood and movie ends. (best dialogue of the movie:  Park ranger 1: 'Where would a wolf get a cheap old ring' Park ranger 2: *Walks from map to bulletin board with 4 missing women posters in obviously sparsely populated town* 'I think I might have an idea'  Park ranger 2: *Goes to abandoned car 3rd time, finds bodies, steps in bear traps left by mysoginistic husband and dies*)   I have never left a review of anything before. I am doing this because I feel it is an actual service and I needed therapeutic treatment after watching this crap. Ya know what woulda been awesome screenwriter? THE WOLF COMES BACK AND EATS SERIAL KILLER. Still would be more believable than anything in this movie. 0%
/m/pg_psycho_goreman	7db7bd1d-301a-3107-88b5-7247f3b3e34e	0.5	This movie is downright terrible. I can't imagine why it received such high score. Everything about it, masks, costumes, environment (basically was filmed in a garage, a house and roadside woods) etc. is like a cheap Z-category minimal budget movie made by nerd teenagers without any knowledge of how to make a movie or sense of humour. Actors are terrible, MCs are irritating, dialogues are written with zero IQ, story is non-existent, jokes are embarrassing. We with my wife practically made a challenge out of enduring till the end of the movie.  And don't get me wrong, I understand and often like bizarre or dark humour. But this is just a pile of rotten feces.  Beware, stay away, never touch this movie, otherwise you will lose years of your life span.
/m/pg_psycho_goreman	7db7bd1d-301a-3107-88b5-7247f3b3e34e	4	An absolutely fun romp in the gore/comedy genre. Lots of laugh out loud moments, no scares. Suffers only slightly from some plot threads that could have been trimmed. But the fantastic costumes and effects make up for the shortcomings.
/m/pg_psycho_goreman	7db7bd1d-301a-3107-88b5-7247f3b3e34e	4.5	Give it a chance, there's a creative effort in this one, it's like an 80's horror b movie for children. Mimi character is a little too much annoying and OP lol
/m/pg_psycho_goreman	7db7bd1d-301a-3107-88b5-7247f3b3e34e	3	This was "somewhat" entertaining.  It had a campy charm, but it was overall pointless to me.  I had rare chuckles at certain parts.  Good special effects.  Watchable one time only, but I will never watch it again.  I'm sure it will obtain cult status with some folks who have very little taste.
/m/pg_psycho_goreman	7db7bd1d-301a-3107-88b5-7247f3b3e34e	4	Psycho Goreman is an over the top cheesy and gory movie, perfect if you love the cheesy movies of the 80's. Mimi is a little psychopath in the training. At first she annoyed me but, by the end I liked her "everything is about me and must do what I want" attitude.

/m/pg_psycho_goreman	7db7bd1d-301a-3107-88b5-7247f3b3e34e	1	One of the worst movies I’ve ever seen
/m/pg_psycho_goreman	7db7bd1d-301a-3107-88b5-7247f3b3e34e	2	Summary: What the hell did I just watch? It's like I'm going back to the 90s in this movie's production.
/m/pg_psycho_goreman	7db7bd1d-301a-3107-88b5-7247f3b3e34e	2.5	Psycho Goreman is a perfect film... if you love intentional cheese. While there are aspects of the film that most assuredly achieve their intended purposes, I can't say that I, personally, found myself actually enjoying my experience watching the film. Horror doesn't always equate to "enjoyable viewing" I realize; however, as it is also a comedy, I only found myself actually laughing at one sequence (when a cop is turned into a gooey, bloody zombie-type mess, and all of his subsequent actions until he is dispatched had me rolling). There are other moments that are amusing, and left me smirking, but other larger sequences of the film had me bored or uncomfortable. I can't claim that this film is a total waste of time, because it is actually remarkable what the filmmakers were able to accomplish given the budget of the project clocked in around $300,000. Mostly practical effects were used, but some things, like costumes especially, were slightly reminiscent of the practical effects seen in Saban's Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers series from back in the 90s. At least those effects were less obvious due to the poor quality of the cameras back then. The practical gore effects were realistic, but the CGI effects? Again, it was very likely that it was intended to be campy and silly, but woof. For me, that is just not what I look for in a film. Everything about this movie has me wanting to give praise, because again, I'm sure this is what they were going for, but my lack of enjoyment during the film has a hard time being generous. I will say that Nita-Josee Hanna's dire commitment to her bossy, domineering sister character was commendable and funny at times, concerning at others (of course, that concern can likely only present itself if the viewer has denied suspension of disbelief). So, if I could offer someone a recommendation before they consider watching this B-movie inspired venture, I'd remind them that it requires TOTAL suspension of disbelief, or perhaps maybe a bong hit?
/m/pg_psycho_goreman	7db7bd1d-301a-3107-88b5-7247f3b3e34e	5	I love this movie. its like a mix of power rangers costumes and fighting and troma horror effects. the story is great.

/m/baby_done	4300f8a8-3da6-4a72-a60c-18c26389691f	2	What a mess.  It's not funny and it's often repulsing, but the leading duo of Rose Matafeo and Matthew Lewis are fine.  The film can't pick a lane and tries to be daring, but it comes off as over the top and unrealistic.  The conclusion comes out of nowhere and makes no sense.  My wife dodged a bullet missing this one.  Final Score: 4/10
/m/baby_done	4300f8a8-3da6-4a72-a60c-18c26389691f	2	Another clear example of what Critics think is a good film and then reality crashes into their faces where general populous dislike it with uproar.

/m/baby_done	4300f8a8-3da6-4a72-a60c-18c26389691f	3.5	Fantastic performances, pretty funny and moving throughout - the pacing was a bit odd but damn Rose Matafeo did an incredible job
/m/baby_done	4300f8a8-3da6-4a72-a60c-18c26389691f	0.5	Absolute drivel, It felt like a pilot for a sitcom dragged out to movie length for no reason at all.  The acting is average the "jokes" are abysmal and it has 30 mins of filler in a 1 hour 30 min film  I am at a loss as to why the critics rate it so highly.
/m/baby_done	4300f8a8-3da6-4a72-a60c-18c26389691f	2.5	A gentle movie, not quite a comedy, but pleasant enough. The quality of performances kept me watching in anticipation but the problem is the lack of plot. There are no surprising twists or turns. "Baby Done" does not take the audience anywhere.
/m/baby_done	4300f8a8-3da6-4a72-a60c-18c26389691f	2.5	Matthew Lewis was great in this one.

/m/baby_done	4300f8a8-3da6-4a72-a60c-18c26389691f	4	This quirky independent rom-com features a crackling script and great performances from the leads.  The supporting and bit parts are filled with a who's -who of the New Zealand comedy scene.
/m/sister_of_the_groom	0db0942b-7350-3579-bcc7-d3c158da5792	1	Nice try, but feels forced, the acting doesn't feel real, the dialogue is dull and cheesy.

/m/max_cloud	a85311bb-c00a-4ab3-a25d-c1e25a9e0b83	3	Really corny riff on Jumanji or Last Starfighter, but there are a bunch of fun bits, and it's nice to see how lovingly they recreated the old-school side scrolling video games of the 90s.
/m/max_cloud	a85311bb-c00a-4ab3-a25d-c1e25a9e0b83	3.5	In this 80's/90's style epic we meet Sarah an extreme video game enthusiast and her game of choice, The Intergalactic Adventures of Max Cloud. Sarah however plays way too much for her dad Tony's liking which leads him to grounding her from the game right when she stumbles on an in game easter egg. When she goes to sleep the game appears to take a life of it's own and transports Sarah into the game. When she awakes she learns she is in the body of a playable character in the game, now is tasked with teaming up with Max Cloud and friends to fight their way through the intergalactic prison they've crashed on to complete the game and presumably escape game to return home. While intrenched in this battle Sarah's character is controlled by her partner in crime, Cowboy, who discovers the truth of Sarah while playing the game in her room back in Brooklyn.     Everything this film set out to do was accomplished to a tee. This film never once tries to take itself seriously which to me is a pro in this movie. Everything here was made by it's design, from the cheesy dialog to the over the top stereotypes and action sequences. The sets were perfect really putting you in the game. The fight sequences looked the part of The Power Rangers and you guessed it, it was the intent and aim of the filmmaker. This is an amazing turn your brain off feature where nostalgia is king bringing you back to more simpler times. Quite honestly the fun filled ride that did my soul good given the current atmosphere in the world.
/m/max_cloud	a85311bb-c00a-4ab3-a25d-c1e25a9e0b83	4.5	Very Well Done MAX CLOUD  i.e  Scott Adkins .... I am a JCVD and now a days SCOTT ADKINS  fan , This movie is a good change of pace by Martial Arts Action Star Scott Adkins and some Entertainment and a bit comedy combined together. The movie could have been even larger than life if produced with greater budget. But any how it has given good colors specially if compared with recent Adkins movies such as Debt Collector 2 , Avengement and Savage Dog . this one can capture Audience in broader spectrum i,e Kids .  As far as Action packed yes indeed Scott is the name of Real Action.
/m/max_cloud	a85311bb-c00a-4ab3-a25d-c1e25a9e0b83	5	amazing movie so far my frist movie 2021 hehe
/m/max_cloud	a85311bb-c00a-4ab3-a25d-c1e25a9e0b83	3	Have you ever wondered what virtual reality would be like inside a 90s style arcade game ? This movie does an exceptional job of showing you 3.1. If there’s one downside, we get it, toxic masculinity is bad. I don’t need every single movie hammering it down my throat
/m/max_cloud	a85311bb-c00a-4ab3-a25d-c1e25a9e0b83	1	Thirst i thougt it was funny, but that lastet maybe 5 minutes. Then its just shitty boring.

/m/dont_tell_a_soul	f66da779-bdf1-49d3-a029-778ca8fc2f9d	5	This was a very interesting movie that is well worth the watch.
/m/dont_tell_a_soul	f66da779-bdf1-49d3-a029-778ca8fc2f9d	2.5	Before watching this I thought I would really enjoy this movie.  I love the storyline in the beginning but about halfway through the twists and turns start and that's when I started to find it rather corny and unbelievable.  I would have been happy with a simple storyline.  Can't say I recommend it.
/m/dont_tell_a_soul	f66da779-bdf1-49d3-a029-778ca8fc2f9d	1	Blah. Dreary dreary film. Don't waste your time.
/m/dont_tell_a_soul	f66da779-bdf1-49d3-a029-778ca8fc2f9d	3	Alex McAulay's Don't Tell a Soul has good intentions, but struggles by trying to pack in too much in to its small runtime. The cast is great, Jack Dylan Grazer, Fionn Whitehead, Mena Suvari, and Rainn Wilson. However, they seem to stumble in their usual strong acting, a symptom of McAulay's (currently) poor writing. I decided to watch this movie because who isn't intrigued by Rainn Wilson delivering his lines from in a pit? Midway through I found myself actually enjoying it, interested it is bizarre story. Yet, towards the end, just as I thought this was going to finish as a pleasant surprise, the flick jumbled itself up and rushed its ending without reason. Overall, the majority of Don't Tell a Soul is entertaining, but won't leave viewers as satisfied as expected. But, this is a great debut for McAulay, who shows many good things that he can build on.
/m/dont_tell_a_soul	f66da779-bdf1-49d3-a029-778ca8fc2f9d	3	3 out of 5 stars. Dont Tell a Soul is a fair psychological thriller film about two brothers Joey (Jack Dylan Grazer) and Matt (Fionn Whitehead) who break into an elderly house to steal money. And than being chased into the woods from a security guard Hamby (Rainn Wilson). Until he falls in a deep hole. Matt assists they leave him there to die. While Joey grows anxious to help and save him. Which Matt becomes hostile every time Joey thinks about saving him. What worked? Decent plot about two brothers. Joey is a good kid who keeps getting abused by his older brother Matt. Who is aggressive and hostile. While Joey grows anxious to save Hamby. There is a surprising twist that may shock and take the film into an interesting direction. The cast did okay with there roles. What did not work with the film? The direction was a bit dull. And slow moving The script was flat with the characters.
/m/dont_tell_a_soul	f66da779-bdf1-49d3-a029-778ca8fc2f9d	3	I liked the acting and the surprise elements but it was overall a mediocre thriller, kind of slow burn. Forgettable but entertaining to see what's going to happen next.
/m/dont_tell_a_soul	f66da779-bdf1-49d3-a029-778ca8fc2f9d	3.5	A gripping and intense thriller with a unique plot and big twists. Don't Tell a Soul is a great film owing to its pace, performances and highly satisfactory conclusion. It's definitely worth watching and recommended.
/m/dont_tell_a_soul	f66da779-bdf1-49d3-a029-778ca8fc2f9d	3.5	I know the reviews are mostly negative but it's a pretty fun RIDICULOUS movie! I love horror/thrillers and this is a fun one. There's lots of twists and turns. Watched this with my mom, we had a good time guessing the next twists. Is it realistic, highly memorable, or to be taken seriously? No. But it's a good time for a night in.
/m/dont_tell_a_soul	f66da779-bdf1-49d3-a029-778ca8fc2f9d	1.5	Very dark, very suspenseful, weird, and deeply unsatisfying. Quite good until the last act (that's why the extra star-would have been half a star) which is too many twisty things that make no sense in terms of human behavior, one of them being the filmmaker paints the burgeoning of a psychopath through the entire film and then tries to make him a sympathetic character in the last couple minutes. It absolutely doesn't work, along with most everything else. Like basically everyone growing into psychopathy. This filmmaker seems to see the world much like the horror writer Richard Laymon, who wrote every character besides the protagonist as a psychopath. Every single person. If the world were really like Laymon's, or this guy's, there'd be fifty violent crimes a day in a town of 400.
/m/dont_tell_a_soul	f66da779-bdf1-49d3-a029-778ca8fc2f9d	5	I LOVED the twists!  Great acting.  Watch this - better then other movies out now.
/m/redemption_day	0735660f-b802-31d0-90e7-05cc8208baef	2	They kidnapped the wrong wife.  So this is about a Marine Captain (Gary Dourdan).  His archeologist wife (Serinda Swan) travels to Africa to excavate a site on the Moroccan-Algerian border only to promptly get snatched up by Algerian insurgents.  It's not standard hostage negotiation policy, but who can stop a Marine from trying to save his wife?  Now, this was yet another movie that I went into pretty cold.  I knew that it had Andy Garcia in the cast list, but after Passengers, that doesn't exactly mean much.  I couldn't get a gauge on if this was a war movie or a Taken situation going off of the plot description.  Well, the answer falls somewhere in between the two, but unfortunately, it is highly generic.  Now I don't have a lot in the way of positive things to say about Redemption Day.  If I had to say something nice about it, I would say Gary Dourdan is trying.  You can tell that he thought this was going to be a decent-sized break for him, and for what it's worth, it's cool to see a person of color in the role that would traditionally go to a bulky handsome white man.  While he may be getting an A for effort, the rest of the cast, not so much.  The acting is a bit shaky, and the story had already mostly lost me before I was out of the first half.  There's just not that much happening that is engaging.  The script is lackluster, the direction is not terribly competent, and there are no new ideas brought to the table.  There's sloppy exposition as this is getting set up, like making Ernie Hudson say, "Look, I'm your father."  Not to be insensitive, but the insurgents are just the standard brown villains that you get in every one of these movies of this type, only this time they are from northern Africa instead of the Middle East.  They don't have any personality other than to be intimidating, and they don't have an end goal other than to extort money from the U.S. government because a citizen accidentally put a toe on Algerian soil.  Redemption Day is not a prime-time film, and it is just barely a B war movie.  It is simple enough to follow, but you're not going to care because you have seen it all before.  The setup is weak, and when this eventually and inevitably turns into Call of Duty, I was more than ready to cut this off.  I do give minor points for Dourdan, but he does not have a lot to work with here.
/m/redemption_day	0735660f-b802-31d0-90e7-05cc8208baef	0.5	No amount of money ever bought a second of time and good Lord I have just wasted 90 minutes of my life on possibly the worst movie I have seen in years.Do yourself a favor and don't bother.
/m/redemption_day	0735660f-b802-31d0-90e7-05cc8208baef	1.5	Very very basic movie. Full of plot holes, and ridiculous things that make no sense. For example, dragging a body from behind a vehicle into the line of fire. He was very obvious they did not have a single military liaison to help with this movie.   Don't waste your time watching this movie.
/m/redemption_day	0735660f-b802-31d0-90e7-05cc8208baef	1	Terrible writing, acting, directing. Funny to watch because of how bad it is.
/m/redemption_day	0735660f-b802-31d0-90e7-05cc8208baef	1	Unfortunately a dumb story.  cliched.  Dedicated to Islamophobia.  Bad representation.  How long will these films be shown and money spent on them?  Its time is over.
/m/redemption_day	0735660f-b802-31d0-90e7-05cc8208baef	0.5	Simply rotten. Too many known actors that are no substitute for good story telling, consistency of the story, useless moralizing, and a mezcla of disconnected story lines. Think of Gigli the flop except this one has shootings left and right. Just Awful.

It is a story of determination and overcoming obstacles.  Sam and his brilliant piano player/musical director Todd Schroeder take you on a roller coaster ride of emotions.  In the end you are left with the hope of inclusiveness for all humans.  ❤️❤️❤️
/m/ham_a_musical_memoir	58fc39f8-7c23-4c07-a2af-a1584193dd98	5	Inspired by his book of the same name, Sam Harris skillfully relates anecdotes of growing up a gay man in the buckle of the Bible Belt, as well as his experiences on stages. Sam displays his talents as an author, storyteller, songwriter, and vocalist. It is funny, witty, and dramatic - often at the same time! Kudos to Todd Schroeder, the piano player and musical director. A must see!
/m/the_one_you_feed	533621bd-ee76-3b9c-812b-7edc6f5f0db8	4.5	For the viewer there may be more than one interpretation of The One You Feed....I watched it 2x and  confirmed my own thoughts of the storyline and plot.  The lack of dialogue adds to the mystique and allows for the viewer to create his own story in his or her mind.  The soundtrack and the cinematography are very good and I did find some humor in some of the lines/scenes - whether intentional or not it was not out of context.  The inter-relationships between man, woman and stranger I found interesting and ending dialogue between man and woman took me by surprise.  For a lower-budget indie I think the cast/director/producers made an awesome film.
/m/the_one_you_feed	533621bd-ee76-3b9c-812b-7edc6f5f0db8	1	The movie wants to be profound and all it manages to do is confound

/m/stallone_frank_that_is	e8a9788e-a056-4776-9fe0-722a56c83560	4	I'm super excited to share my thoughts about the documentary Stallone: Frank, That Is about a Hollywood star that has seen and done it all.  I am talking about Frank Stallone who has spent nearly 50 years entertaining us with his platinum and gold albums and his amazing songs that have topped the music charts worldwide. His movie soundtracks for the most iconic films remain familiar throughout many generations. Singer, songwriter, musician and an actor…Frank Stallone is a package deal!  Stallone: Frank, That Is, a documentary written and directed by Derek Wayne Johnson, gives viewers an inside look into the life, career and struggles of a performer who has been dubbed "the most unknown famous entertainer in Hollywood." The film takes us behind the scenes as we follow Frank Stallone's professional journey told in words by Frank himself and people within his life who knew him best. Frank's accomplishments seem so remarkable, however for much of his life he has lived within the shadows of his more famous brother, Sylvester Stallone. Being "Rocky's Brother" may have been the largest hindrance to Frank's career, yet the most beneficial, because Frank's first real break within the industry came from his contributions to the Rocky Film Series. Frank Stallone's story is one of perseverance, inner strength, and a passion for the arts.   Frank's path has been filled with many opportunities and setbacks. Everyone, of course, has heard of Sylvester Stallone, yet, just as talented Frank has remained the Stallone underdog. I believe this documentary is exactly what Frank Stallone needs in order to share with the world exactly who he is, what he's done, and just how talented he actually is. Frank is exceptionally courageous in sharing his deepest inferior feelings and reveals to the world that there is room for more than one Stallone!   I truly enjoyed hearing from Mr. Stallone talk about how difficult his journey has been and how he hurdled so many obstacles to follow his dreams. As a young actor, I know firsthand how frustrating and disheartening it is to try to make it big within the talent world. I can relate to the look on Frank's face when as he discusses the setbacks he has faced. The industry is certainly competitive. What every entertainer needs is a will to push forward and a strong support base. The closest people in Frank Stallone's life offer words of encouragement to this amazing entertainer, which I believe is the message of this perseverant film; lots of support and self-confidence are needed if you are going to succeed within this terribly competitive niche. You need to navigate around your obstacles in order to reach your dreams.   I give Stallone: Frank, That Is 4 out of 5 stars and I recommend it to ages 12 to 18.

/m/stars_fell_on_alabama	4bd0a38a-3457-33e8-b7bd-e84aa3b94048	1.5	This had to be a lifetime movie with this acting and writing 1.7. That’s without mentioning the predictability, cliches and corniness
/m/stars_fell_on_alabama	4bd0a38a-3457-33e8-b7bd-e84aa3b94048	2	This Hulu romcom hits all the familiar beats... Hollywood agent convinces his actress client to pretend to be his girlfriend on a trip to his small home town in Alabama for his high school reunion. James Maslow and Ciara Hanna star in this and they have the required chemistry as of course they wind up falling in love in the film...  I still enjoyed the film, pleasant enough viewing, despite not being anything particularly new.
/m/stars_fell_on_alabama	4bd0a38a-3457-33e8-b7bd-e84aa3b94048	0.5	Oh my goodness, I am no movie connoisseur but I've never seen a movie quite this bad. The acting was terrible and the script was abysmal. Don't waste your five dollars or more importantly the two hours of your life to watch this bomb.
/m/stars_fell_on_alabama	4bd0a38a-3457-33e8-b7bd-e84aa3b94048	2	The premise was good but the script was terrible and the acting was about the caliber of a middle school play.
/m/stars_fell_on_alabama	4bd0a38a-3457-33e8-b7bd-e84aa3b94048	3.5	Enjoyable for a light movie. Ciara Hanna did a very good job.
/m/stars_fell_on_alabama	4bd0a38a-3457-33e8-b7bd-e84aa3b94048	0.5	Painful to watch. If your significant other picks this movie feign a stomach virus, poke yourself in the eye or stick your finger in an electrical outlet to save yourself.
/m/stars_fell_on_alabama	4bd0a38a-3457-33e8-b7bd-e84aa3b94048	1	That was bad. I felt bad for the actors for having to do this. Bad cinematography, horrible script with a storyline that did not make sense at times ? Also was supposed to be filmed in Alabama... but the palm trees everywhere gave it away that is was in the East Coast.
/m/stars_fell_on_alabama	4bd0a38a-3457-33e8-b7bd-e84aa3b94048	5	If you love romcoms, this is one not to miss.  James Maslow and Ciarra Hanna were great, as was the rest of the cast.  It's a great movie for the entire family.  Loved seeing Taylor Hicks perform.  The music was great!
/m/stars_fell_on_alabama	4bd0a38a-3457-33e8-b7bd-e84aa3b94048	5	Perfect romcom. Good main characters, some really good supporting character, good music and good scenery. It was a really nice movie with what I would guess are some future big stars.

/m/gun_and_a_hotel_bible	fae7132b-23ee-323f-a580-68744107d0a3	5	Very impressed by this movie! Loved the story and the acting. And the editing and cinematography was very smooth and well done.
/m/gun_and_a_hotel_bible	fae7132b-23ee-323f-a580-68744107d0a3	5	This film has absolutely amazing cinematography and editing as well as acting. You should totally watch it!
/m/gun_and_a_hotel_bible	fae7132b-23ee-323f-a580-68744107d0a3	5	I a committed to passing on my high review of this little movie because it offers BIG ideas.  It's entertaining and thought-provoking all at once.  And you can't just watch it and walk away.  Be sure to watch with someone whom you can talk to about it afterwards.  That makes it even a richer experience!  It's a 5 Star film!
/m/gun_and_a_hotel_bible	fae7132b-23ee-323f-a580-68744107d0a3	4	Tough to write a review if I don't talk about the ending;  I'm not going to do that (no spoiler here).  Very thought provoking if you ever think about the relationship between God and you... or even if you don't, I guess.  I was impressed with the acting.  Money well spent, IMO.
/m/gun_and_a_hotel_bible	fae7132b-23ee-323f-a580-68744107d0a3	5	Great conversation! It is worth seeing and walking the journey out!
/m/gun_and_a_hotel_bible	fae7132b-23ee-323f-a580-68744107d0a3	5	More intense than expected. Certainly a very thought-provoking take on the Beatles song! Overall this was deep and engaging, providing a surprisingly fresh and reasonably balanced look at some hard questions!
/m/gun_and_a_hotel_bible	fae7132b-23ee-323f-a580-68744107d0a3	5	It's compelling, heart rending, funny and devastating. Dynamically directed and produced, exquisitely  acted, and thoughtfully, precisely, passionately and inventively written. it doesn't hit you over the head with "religion" but opens the door for deeper thoughts on deeper meanings and our common depravities. Kudos and bravo to the creators.
/m/gun_and_a_hotel_bible	fae7132b-23ee-323f-a580-68744107d0a3	5	Unexpected.  You just don't know what's coming.  Not what you think, that's for sure.  Not religious.  Not cutesy.  Not too heavy or formulaic.  Moving, but not where I expected.  We are all in that hotel room at some point.  You won't regret this hour.
/m/if_not_now_when_2021	cd09eba8-3112-3323-bcd2-b23a73a43483	5	I enjoyed the movie.  I believe it's a movie women can relate to.  I hope there's a part 2 and that they retain the original cast.
/m/if_not_now_when_2021	cd09eba8-3112-3323-bcd2-b23a73a43483	3	Too long, but otherwise cute!
/m/if_not_now_when_2021	cd09eba8-3112-3323-bcd2-b23a73a43483	3	Its quite solid maybe a little long, some scence could have been edited, even if I dont know the actors they all give goodish performances.
/m/if_not_now_when_2021	cd09eba8-3112-3323-bcd2-b23a73a43483	5	I'm gonna watch this it sounds so good.
/m/dr_birds_advice_for_sad_poets	2b1d73a3-c784-3dcf-bdb8-240a29a09803	5	it's a sensitive and aesthetic portray about mental illness and finding beauty in life. a precious gem!
/m/dr_birds_advice_for_sad_poets	2b1d73a3-c784-3dcf-bdb8-240a29a09803	3	It's too quirky for its own good...trying to weave finding his sister in with a new love interest and advice from a bird - this movie is all over the place.  What could be touching is so schmaltzy that it loses its bite altogether.
/m/dr_birds_advice_for_sad_poets	2b1d73a3-c784-3dcf-bdb8-240a29a09803	4.5	I watched this movie with my teen kids and we all loved it.
/m/dr_birds_advice_for_sad_poets	2b1d73a3-c784-3dcf-bdb8-240a29a09803	0.5	Nothing special. Zumann's forced attempt to be quirky makes you roll your eyes and doesn't make justice into expose the actual feelings of someone with serious mental health. There are bunch of jokes without good sense of comedy and almost 2 hours of a plot that actually isn't explored.  The main couple has no chemistry at all, which is ironic since the whole family drama, seriousness of mental health which should be more developed and the focus of the movie is putting aside to put under spotlight a romantic teenage drama that cannot even feel real. This film tries to bring too many  things happening at once, hence loosing its essence. Do yourself a favor by watching another movie.
/m/dr_birds_advice_for_sad_poets	2b1d73a3-c784-3dcf-bdb8-240a29a09803	0.5	This movie is very bad in so many levels. Is like a meal with too many ingredients that at first looks nice, but in the end just have a bad taste in your mouth. Most people just watch this movie because the actor who plays Gilbert  from Anne with an E is in it and therefore are too bias to actually give a realistic feedback.
/m/dr_birds_advice_for_sad_poets	2b1d73a3-c784-3dcf-bdb8-240a29a09803	5	Captivating. A peek into a world not spoken enough about.
/m/dr_birds_advice_for_sad_poets	2b1d73a3-c784-3dcf-bdb8-240a29a09803	0.5	This movie is a joke. Too long to the point it become boring, because the real plot is never explored until the last minute, failed attempts of comedy, exaggerated and ridiculous special effects that try to exemplify the intensity of the characters feelings, but turn up looking like something Disney's movies do to not show or say it out loud if a character is turned on. The acting of Lucas Zumann is forced and mediocre and this movie is not a complete failure only because Taylor Russell is the anchor for this ship not sink. Is a generic ordinary coming of age movie that like many others released few years ago try to romanticize mental illness, but not even this is well accomplished because instead of exploring more in depth the problematic family or the anxiety problem of the main character, just decide to focus on the "romantic" relationship loosing focus of the main story. But hey, as long as Zumann with his pretty face still reminds his fans of Gilbert from Anne with an E why give importance to the content of the movie right? Is a mess. Don't waste your time.
/m/dr_birds_advice_for_sad_poets	2b1d73a3-c784-3dcf-bdb8-240a29a09803	5	A magical, visually stunning, touching film.  One of the most original I've ever seen.
/m/dr_birds_advice_for_sad_poets	2b1d73a3-c784-3dcf-bdb8-240a29a09803	5	Exceptional acting, great script and a unique but important look at youth and mental health
/m/dr_birds_advice_for_sad_poets	2b1d73a3-c784-3dcf-bdb8-240a29a09803	5	The film brought humor to serious subject matter...mental health. The performance of Lucas Zumann, as James, was never over the top. He was charmingly comedic and showed a full range of emotions expressing what it was like to struggle with anxiety and a dysfunctional family, as well as typical teenage angst and first love.
/m/caged_2021	b74b1e76-cf1f-325c-81ec-c31e1ae5c84f	5	Good movie, good plot
/m/caged_2021	b74b1e76-cf1f-325c-81ec-c31e1ae5c84f	0.5	I was confused about what type of movie it was supposed to be. The plot is just a guy stuck in a cell and tortured by a bitter woman. Complete waste of time. It didn't even end with a conclusion.
/m/caged_2021	b74b1e76-cf1f-325c-81ec-c31e1ae5c84f	3.5	A rather boring film that kept me on screen due to the fact that the film takes place in prison and also due to whether the imprisoned person actually killed his wife or not. But that's all there is to this film good. As for the film effects and the story itself, it's a big disaster. An interesting idea, but unfortunately poorly implemented, which is a great pity. Otherwise, it could be a good movie, but unfortunately it didn't happen and the film became more of a boring spectacle, which I wished for a while to end.
/m/caged_2021	b74b1e76-cf1f-325c-81ec-c31e1ae5c84f	3.5	I'm excited to see this
/m/caged_2021	b74b1e76-cf1f-325c-81ec-c31e1ae5c84f	5	I was extremely surprised on how much I enjoyed this movie. The story and directing was amazing. It had a great cast that I recognized almost every actor (including Jan from the Office!).
/m/koko_di_koko_da	a285192f-189e-4600-9d33-d036fc80f603	3.5	The more I think about this movie, the more I like it. The puppetry is gorgeous, and the folkloric characters that illustrate the metaphor at the end are particularly effective. The slow pace is no huge bargain, but after the fact, it leaves you with a strange mythical feeling. This movie is not completely satisfying but pretty darn good in its defiance of following convention. It's original, that's for sure.
/m/koko_di_koko_da	a285192f-189e-4600-9d33-d036fc80f603	3.5	This was very slow for the first half and I gave up but I watched a second time and glad I did as it was quite good. Very creepy. There was really no explanation for any of the strange events but I'm not sure if it mattered.
/m/koko_di_koko_da	a285192f-189e-4600-9d33-d036fc80f603	5	Best film of the year!
/m/koko_di_koko_da	a285192f-189e-4600-9d33-d036fc80f603	1.5	An old-school Swedish grief-parable and pretty baleful. I'm not sure I'd recommend it; it's not as clever or emotionally moving as it thinks it is but it is grim. Couple grieving for their dead child are subjected to a cycle of weird torments by a group of surrealist fairy-tale psychopaths in a wood.   It's not as horrible as 'Funny Games' or 'Antichrist' by far but it shares a similar dreary, circular ambience. Cool shadow-puppet sequence in the middle. Cw for several dead dogs.
/m/koko_di_koko_da	a285192f-189e-4600-9d33-d036fc80f603	4	A very unusual mixture of elements which ultimately work surprisingly-well together.
/m/koko_di_koko_da	a285192f-189e-4600-9d33-d036fc80f603	0.5	I think the critics view movies through a weird social paradigm, instead of actual entertainment.  The scores on this movie are a perfect example.  I know it's been slow during the pandemic but holy smokes this is bad and no you aren't hip or artsy if you think it's great.
/m/koko_di_koko_da	a285192f-189e-4600-9d33-d036fc80f603	2	Unsettling. Vague. Not really sure what i was watching at first but little by little became more clear. Still not enough character development and few plot tension or actual scares could not manage to bring the arty bizarre show to stronger territories that would have made it one piece of a kind movie...which in a way still is but not enough to stick with you for long.
/m/koko_di_koko_da	a285192f-189e-4600-9d33-d036fc80f603	2	I can very much appreciate the filmmaking craft on display here, but it just wasn't for me. Brace yourselves for the ear worm you never wanted!
/m/koko_di_koko_da	a285192f-189e-4600-9d33-d036fc80f603	1	This is what David Lynch's nightmares must be like -- a groundhog day of despair and depravity.    There is one scene -- only one freaking scene -- that is absolutely gripping and terrifying to anybody that has had a child.   And the rest is just art-for-for art's sake with little effort to connect the dots.
/m/koko_di_koko_da	a285192f-189e-4600-9d33-d036fc80f603	3.5	I've got to admit, I found some elements of this a little repetitive, which I know is the point but I was starting to wonder just how long it was going to go on for. Picked up, though, and ended well, albeit with quite a few questions unresolved. Certainly memorable!
/m/billie_2020	45e99f80-4351-3dab-89e1-9239329892a4	3.5	Hubby and Wife date afternoon brings us, 'Billie', a documentary about Billie Holiday. The feature is based around interviews recorded on audio cassettes through the 1970s by Linda Lipnack Kuehl, researching a book on Holiday that was never completed.  Those never heard before stories give us a thorough portrait of Holiday.   Your mileage will vary based on how much audio you can take, but it's put together in a way that makes this a visually satisfying experience.  The film tries to intertwine the story of the journalist and that doesn't always work.  It's fairly sloppy to insinuate a murder took place without the least shred of proof.  Final Score: Hubby 7.5 Wife: 5.7 Average: 6.6/10
/m/billie_2020	45e99f80-4351-3dab-89e1-9239329892a4	5	The greatest retelling of Billie Holiday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

/m/billie_2020	45e99f80-4351-3dab-89e1-9239329892a4	5	Amazingly well put together documentary. I have always loved Billie Holiday. Despite her dying decades before I was born, she speaks to me. And, this documentary told so much more of her story.
/m/white_riot	4d9f7971-7879-3304-8af3-4c640d6e00f1	5	One of the greatest movies I have ever seen.
/m/the_planters	a24653b8-9457-4eaf-b4da-ee4d5748f49e	5	One of the best films I have seen in ages. I laughed with the two leading ladies who created a can't pause film. Kudos ladies!
/m/the_planters	a24653b8-9457-4eaf-b4da-ee4d5748f49e	3.5	Quirky and oddball pulled off really well. The actors did a wonderful job not going too far in the peculiarity of their characters. A charming story.
/m/the_planters	a24653b8-9457-4eaf-b4da-ee4d5748f49e	5	I love this movie.  But I don't know why. 😁
/m/the_planters	a24653b8-9457-4eaf-b4da-ee4d5748f49e	2.5	Alexandra Kotcheff and Hannah Leder made a movie together.  They wrote, directed, produced, and starred in a film that has a germ of an idea that never quite reaches full comedic potential.  It's certainly hard to look away from, but the sum of the parts don't add up to much.  It's a picture you're more likely to remember than most, but that's damning with faint praise.  Mental illness meets claymation meets who the hell knows.  Don't take this too seriously.  Final Score: 5/10
/m/the_planters	a24653b8-9457-4eaf-b4da-ee4d5748f49e	3.5	3.3. I think I liked it just because it felt like an even weirder Wes Anderson
/m/the_planters	a24653b8-9457-4eaf-b4da-ee4d5748f49e	0.5	Shameless, vapid, Wes Anderson ripoff. Worst offense is that it wasted an hour of my time as a I had to fast forward through it to finally get to the end. There is derivative and then there is theft. This is the latter. Holywood should do a better job of policing itself.
/m/the_planters	a24653b8-9457-4eaf-b4da-ee4d5748f49e	3.5	A Wes Anderson style of movie, with the camera shots, quirky actors, and story.
/m/the_planters	a24653b8-9457-4eaf-b4da-ee4d5748f49e	4	Wes Anderson be shacking
/m/the_planters	a24653b8-9457-4eaf-b4da-ee4d5748f49e	5	Saw this film when it showed at the Ace in LA. Probably the best thing to come out of 2020. Super dry/quirky/slapstick...goes great with friends and a couple of gin and tonics. Can't wait to see it again. Definitely recommend to everyone (and everyone who needs to escape this year of hell we're in). Honestly, I wish I were a planter.
/m/the_planters	a24653b8-9457-4eaf-b4da-ee4d5748f49e	4.5	I pretty much frick'n loved this film. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is certainly mine. The comedy was all over the place: deadpan, slapstick, absurdist. Truly a gem during these sh*tty times. I escaped into this really strange and special world. Definitely worth the watch.
/m/lupin_iii_the_first	16073d52-856d-37a0-99eb-8d000ed2ddea	4	Proving that in the right hands, a long-running hand-drawn franchise can in fact look great when translated into CGI, the springy antics and historically-amiable fun of Lupin III are back and still swinging from the days of "The Castle of Cagliostro", but this time with a final act that gets more in over its head even by the expected standards.
/m/lupin_iii_the_first	16073d52-856d-37a0-99eb-8d000ed2ddea	5	esta película es totalmente genial y con mucha acción
/m/lupin_iii_the_first	16073d52-856d-37a0-99eb-8d000ed2ddea	5	Real fun, great animation!
/m/lupin_iii_the_first	16073d52-856d-37a0-99eb-8d000ed2ddea	5	Lupin III: The First is a perfect movie that brings a popular character from 2-D to 3-D animation. I love the story, the characters, the voice actors, the animation and the shocking twists. I also enjoy the action sequences and humor. Overall, Lupin III: The First is a perfect animated film that brings a pop culture figure to new generations.
/m/lupin_iii_the_first	16073d52-856d-37a0-99eb-8d000ed2ddea	5	"Lupin III: El Primero", logra perfectamente la transición de los personajes del ya fallecido mangaka, Monkey Punch, a la 3era dimensión. Su animación, comedia y banda sonora son los puntos fuertes de este filme, el cual, encapsula perfectamente lo que ha hecho que la saga sea tan entrañable durante mas de 50 años.
/m/lupin_iii_the_first	16073d52-856d-37a0-99eb-8d000ed2ddea	5	For new and old fans this is a great movie, this movie has the best animation of any animated movie i've seen! So fun and expressive and the soundtrack renewals are of course amazing
/m/lupin_iii_the_first	16073d52-856d-37a0-99eb-8d000ed2ddea	5	This movie had brilliant animation, brilliant characters, a great plot and story, and fantastic music and all of this makes this movie a anime masterpiece I have no problems with this film it is by far the best anime film I've seen in a long time and it's better than castle of cagliostro. It has the energy, the power, it's feels and looks absolutely beautiful well done Japan and American dub you've made a lot of fans of lupin proud bravo!!
/m/lupin_iii_the_first	16073d52-856d-37a0-99eb-8d000ed2ddea	5	Phenomenal animation! It's so smooth yet refined, a lot of work went into this movie for sure. Genuinely enjoyed every minute of this movie. Not a single filler moment in sight, truly a great film.
/m/lupin_iii_the_first	16073d52-856d-37a0-99eb-8d000ed2ddea	4.5	Popular and loveable rogue Lupin III gets a modern makeover in this highly enjoyable Indiana Jones inspired tale of ancient artefacts and secret Nazi organisations.
/m/lupin_iii_the_first	16073d52-856d-37a0-99eb-8d000ed2ddea	4	Who said you can't be a gentleman burglar? Enjoyed the movie
/m/luxor	d691e007-e016-49f6-8bea-f3981451b4cb	5	Excellent film. An intriguing story about a doctor, Hana, and a former lover that she runs into in Luxor, Egypt.  She's on furlough from practicing medicine in a war zone. Hana is physically and emotionally exhausted from the horrific work and things she saw. As she visits one of the ruins, the tour guide asked the question, " How do we conquer our own inner demons?  The story evolves as if you are walking beside her. The photography is close up and you can feel the surrounding ruin. The relationships feel real. The ending is bewitching. This film is a jewel.
/m/luxor	d691e007-e016-49f6-8bea-f3981451b4cb	0.5	Without doubt the worst film I've ever watched. My wife walked out half way through it was so turgid.
/m/luxor	d691e007-e016-49f6-8bea-f3981451b4cb	1.5	If you want to pass the time watching a travel movie that takes place in Egypt, then go for it. The sights are beautiful. Otherwise, there is no actual story.
/m/luxor	d691e007-e016-49f6-8bea-f3981451b4cb	1	There are just not enough words on the page to make this worthwhile.  There are long stretches of no dialogue in which the story just sits there and it's not pushed forward.  When there are interactions I wished it was a silent film.  Another in the LONG line of short films (15 mins at best) that are stretched for no reason to feature length.  There's little of value here, unless you like people thinking and not speaking.  Final Score: 2/10
/m/luxor	d691e007-e016-49f6-8bea-f3981451b4cb	1	Slow , boring and nothing really happens
/m/luxor	d691e007-e016-49f6-8bea-f3981451b4cb	2	The film is a bit tedious. The main character is difficult to relate to and the story is weak. I did enjoy the views of Luxor but found the movie much too dull.
/m/luxor	d691e007-e016-49f6-8bea-f3981451b4cb	3	The film follows a doctor, played by Andrea Riseborough, recuperating from working in a war zone.  She meanders around ancient Egyptian temples in Luxor, a place she is familiar with.  The writer-director Zeina Durra captures her dislocation from her current surroundings and her attempts to reconnect through the two-thousand-year history in which she is immersed.  However, despite the unique and stunning location, this is also a fairly painful process for the viewer and is ultimately unengaging and unmemorable.
/m/luxor	d691e007-e016-49f6-8bea-f3981451b4cb	0.5	Complete waste of time and money, avoid and watch paint dry instead. Depressive main character never cheers up, no story, dull travelogue for Egyptian tourist sites. Film ends with no evident solution but relief for the viewer that it's over. Avoid.
/m/luxor	d691e007-e016-49f6-8bea-f3981451b4cb	1	Oh dear, oh dear. Boring film. Slow, pretentious. On the plus side...beautifully shot with great scenery.
/m/wander_darkly	dd7a3e1e-f851-4607-a77f-3b6d8d1e0906	3.5	Wander Darkly is a truly fascinating film. A film that is both soulful and experimental. It's an ambitious film that manages to pull it off mostly. Adrienne and Matteo are a couple experiencing strife within themselves despite having a child and a home together. While driving away from a party, their arguing causes an accident that leaves them hospitalized. At this point the film goes on a trip that involves their past and their separate and combined memories. We never quite know where the truth lies but it never gets actually confusing, a testimony to the direction and the great editing to make it all work. It's a visceral film where emotions run high and the memories play tricks. Thanks to great performances from Diego Luna and Sienna Miller the emotions are real and centered. A very clever film where execution matches ambition.
/m/wander_darkly	dd7a3e1e-f851-4607-a77f-3b6d8d1e0906	3	Writer-director Tara Miele's leap from TV to feature debut is essentially a love story with a touch of the supernatural. When the film begins, it's obvious something is not right in the relationship between new parents Adrienne and Matteo, played by Sienna Miller and Diego Luna. One accident later, the film begins retelling their love story via a fluidly executed narrative mechanism that flits between two possible states of mind: is she dead or is she just concussed and confused? To an extent, it's your typical examination of two people falling in love and eventually deciding to live together and have a child, where everything in between is then reassessed with a certain amount of hindsight. The film has something intriguing, if not insightful even, to say as it charts how the couple is challenged as the passion slowly burns away and external forces and pressure intervene. Despite a few clunky dialogue (if you have a shot every time Matteo asks Adrienne do you remember something, you'd be drunk half-way into the film), Miele maintains an effective and mysterious surreality as the film transitions through scenes, time and events, keeping it all dreamily atmospheric while constantly propelling the narrative forward on different levels at the same time. Miller is a solid lead who anchors well and her Adrienne is sympathetic and understandable. In films like this, the best resolution is one that's hidden in plain sight, something that makes sense yet might not have crossed the audience's mind. Even though my suspicion as to where the film was heading is proved correct, I was satisfied with the ending because I didn't feel cheated by it, even if it turns out to be a different and sadder film than I first anticipated.
/m/wander_darkly	dd7a3e1e-f851-4607-a77f-3b6d8d1e0906	4	Heartfelt drama with an ambitious dreamlike style.  Writer and director Tara Miele's surreal romance drama Wander Darkly (2020) is quite moving if you have patience and empathy enough to lose yourself to its dreamy surrealism. Tara Miele is a director to look out for as her creative vision with her endearing script and flowing direction is captivating to Wander Darkly's entire quick 97 minutes. Miele's direction feels similar to Tree of Life, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, i'm thinking of ending things, Inception, Interstellar, and Shutter Island. It's a curious way to shoot a romance drama story while weaving in and out of memories, but Wander Darkly really works. You're absorbed by each scene without ever quite predicting the endless twists. Tara Miele's writing comes across as realistic marriage drama dialogue, existentialism, with hopeful conversations and conclusions. Wander Darkly is satisfying and a curious picture like few others.  Sienna Miller absolutely steals the entire film as the adorable and endearing Adrienne. She's devastating as I really felt for each emotional disturbance or sweet memory with her. Her subtle facial expressions display a genuine understanding for her character's unique suffering. Sienna Miller is phenomenal in Wander Darkly with her nuanced performance. I like her as an actress ever since I was stunned by her beauty, wit, and charisma in Casanova with Heath Ledger. But Miller is particularly touching in Wander Darkly with a grounded sense of pain and love within her intimate acting. Diego Luna is fantastic as Matteo in one of his best dramatic roles in Wander Darkly. He plays the concerned husband, estranged spouse, and loving boyfriend. He feels gentle and sincere, while also hiding something.  Vanessa Bayer is cute and likable as Adrienne's close and supportive friend Maggie. Aimee Carrero is gorgeous and playful as Matteo's flirty other woman Shea. I wish Bayer and Carrero were in Wander Darkly much more to flesh out their characters a bit. Beth Grant's stern and obstinate mother Patty is excellent. You hate and sympathize with her immediately. Brett Rice is good as Adrienne's father Steve, who just doesn't seem to know how to handle his daughter's emotions. Tory Kittles is pretty good as Adrienne's potential other man Liam with his charming personality.  Editors Tamara Meem and Alex O'Flinn cut seamlessly in between dream sequences with fluid pacing and natural motion. Their sleek editing pairs nicely with Carolina Costa's cinematography. Costa's shots are gorgeous in breathtaking wide shots and visually creative close-ups. Her perspective choices are varied and inventive with a pleasant moving camera that flows around the central characters with a warm empathy. Katie Byron's production design allows for esoteric cold hospital hallways and genuinely cozy homes alike. Christopher Lawrence's costumes are pretty modern with an authentic contemporary appeal. Sienna Miller looks stunning in every dress and outfit combination from Lawrence.  Alex Weston's score is so light and romantic with a mesmerizing fantasy feel I really loved. Wander Darkly already looks incredible with vivid colors and bright lights flaring into faces, but alongside Weston's ethereal music, I was swept away to those lovely Mexican sea waters.
/m/wander_darkly	dd7a3e1e-f851-4607-a77f-3b6d8d1e0906	3	Really interesting concept in this metaphysical Romantic drama, but it's all just a little too vague and aimless to fully satisfy. Though I will say, it's the type of film that will have you talking after, trying to unravel the meaning of it all. That and Sienna Miller is excellent in it. Something I never thought I'd say about Sienna Miller...
/m/wander_darkly	dd7a3e1e-f851-4607-a77f-3b6d8d1e0906	2.5	Consistently intriguing, but just as frequently frustrating given the premise of the film pits a woman (Sienna Miller finally making me realize the value of "Starring Sienna Miller") dealing in the trauma, uncertainty, and fragility of life as she moves through her memories while wading between life and death that is all undermined by the fact she spends it dealing with someone she clearly should have never been with in the first place. Diego Luna's Matteo epitomizes "bad boyfriend" vibes or just wasn't the right fit for Miller's Adrienne, I don't know, but either way - the lack of connection or care either of them have for the life they were building together can't help but to translate to the viewer as well. While sporting some cool ideas, some innovative editing, and Miller giving it her all Wander Darkly is ultimately unable to make-up for the lack of engagement (and I mean that in more ways than one) we feel with these people even if we want to sympathize with their circumstances.
/m/wander_darkly	dd7a3e1e-f851-4607-a77f-3b6d8d1e0906	3.5	3.5 out of 5 stars. Wander Darkly is a pretty fair film about a couple Adrienne (Sienna Miller) and Matteo (Diego Luna) who are struggling with there relationship. When an accident leaves them in a trauma. Where they face the past and current conflict with there relationship. They try to resolve there conflict that is holding them back. The plot i can not say much more without going into spoiler territory. It was surprisingly good. A car accident affecting them both. Such as facing life after death. Dealing with loss and grief. And how a humans mind work itself in dealing with trauma. Adrienne and Matteo are dealing with a troubled relationship. Where they test each others love for one and another. It is an emotional movie. And has a twist that will keep you guessing til the end. Diego Luna and Sienna Miller did a great job with there roles. I did find the exposition being too dragged on. And slow in the end. But it is a wonderful film.
/m/wander_darkly	dd7a3e1e-f851-4607-a77f-3b6d8d1e0906	2	I agree with the New York Times: "vague," "poorly developed," "aimless," "never fully rationalized," "insular", "n[ot] worth... sustaining", though it has some "interesting [scenes]."  Watch the Undone mini-series instead.
/m/wander_darkly	dd7a3e1e-f851-4607-a77f-3b6d8d1e0906	4	Sienna Miller is def an underrated, undervalued actress. She has grown into a top notch star (see American Woman if you haven’t yet).
/m/wander_darkly	dd7a3e1e-f851-4607-a77f-3b6d8d1e0906	4.5	One of the best movies under the radar this year. In fact, it is a heartbreaking, WD is very beautifully done. It's like Eternal Sunshine meets Ghost. . P.S. Any Tron or Tron Legacy fans on Rotten Tomatoes?
/m/wander_darkly	dd7a3e1e-f851-4607-a77f-3b6d8d1e0906	5	Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind meets survivor remorse. Solid date night flick, had the girl friend crying!
/m/breaking_surface	a3d11a1f-7c9a-37af-93e8-280d5db650bc	3	Survival movie tutto al femminile che lascia un buono spazio alla fotografia. La trama funziona, è avvincente, con i giusti cambi di direzione che riescono a non renderla monotona. Meno interessanti sono i personaggi, specialmente quello della protagonista, sorella maggiore devastante dai risentimenti e dalla tristezza. Piacevole intrattenimento in un genere in cui negli ultimi anni in scandinavia si sta facendo molto.
/m/breaking_surface	a3d11a1f-7c9a-37af-93e8-280d5db650bc	2	Boring, lame and the main character was an idiot.
/m/breaking_surface	a3d11a1f-7c9a-37af-93e8-280d5db650bc	3.5	This movie was far better than I thought it would be. It kept me engaged throughout, and I didn't expect the ending. I got a bit confused over the whole issue of decompression for divers. Didn't think they were down far enough for this to be a problem, and I couldn't understand why the sister who kept coming and going was a high risk in this regard.  Not sure why anyone would want to go winter diving in Norway! Worth watching. Nice to see a movie where the women aren't fighting for their lives in bikinis. Nothing sexy about this movie. Just good old-fashioned entertainment.
/m/breaking_surface	a3d11a1f-7c9a-37af-93e8-280d5db650bc	2.5	Meh! I mean it was simple and effective but a lot of it was very unbelievable. The way she was throwing rocks at the car was so ridiculous.  The way they were going without air for large chunks of time underwater was pretty ridiculous particularly at the depth they appeared to be.   What was with all the cruelty to animals?!?  Feeding your dog cigarette butts. Leaving it alone unleashed in a dangerous environment with falling rocks! Telling it to shut up when it's clearly distressed!  Breaking into someones house and stabbing their dog!! WTAF! I don't care if youre stuck under a rock at the bottom of a lake, the way you treat animals you deserve it really.
/m/breaking_surface	a3d11a1f-7c9a-37af-93e8-280d5db650bc	4	there's a reason why caving diving is so dangerous, this movie (though fictional) is one of the reason why.
/m/breaking_surface	a3d11a1f-7c9a-37af-93e8-280d5db650bc	3	Movie wasn't that bad. Surprised the user reviews are so harsh. One question I have...Is there really no button to pop the trunk in a Volvo?
/m/breaking_surface	a3d11a1f-7c9a-37af-93e8-280d5db650bc	0.5	This movieis is so far from reality that I coun't watch it without laughing. Nobody can remain at 40 mt depth so long and after ascend like Little Mermaid. The other character (the one unbelivable stupid to be irritating) dives and ascends multiple times without any reasonable way of acting. Very weak story and a great waste of time.
/m/breaking_surface	a3d11a1f-7c9a-37af-93e8-280d5db650bc	1.5	A film that only suspends disbelief but leaves a sour taste , spoilers :  The characters motives are dumb sort of thing you expect from a teen slasher flick both sisters deciding to do diving in poor weather , rocks falling , not properly prepared incase something happens, treatment of dogs two poisoned by nicotine one dead, the guard killed unfairly as the sister couldn't find the boot release, the poor mother dying and they decide to leave her. Dumb plot and the saving grace I don't have to sit through it again
/m/breaking_surface	a3d11a1f-7c9a-37af-93e8-280d5db650bc	4.5	A surprisingly effective exercise that is able to generate far more dread, claustrophobia, and adrenalized terror than thought possible just from reading its barebones premise.   Horror fans should be basking in this film; soaking in all of its nightmare-inducing mania — and there a hell of a lot it.
/m/breaking_surface	a3d11a1f-7c9a-37af-93e8-280d5db650bc	3.5	*Spoilers* Effective thriller, well shot and acted, but not big on resolving any of the personal issues presented, which could have made it a bit better. A couple of seriously unlikable characters as well. One of them gets saved. I hope she doesn't go back to regularly feeding a dog cigarette butts. (?) Why put in there that one of the main characters is poisoning a dog because she doesn't want her mother (whose dog it is) to find out she's smoking? Like I said, personal issues. It clearly says, "We don't want you to like this girl at all." And yet we're supposed to root for her?  Bad piece of writing, unless you give it some later treatment, and we find out the girl gains a freaking conscience. Takes a considerable amount away from the movie. If she'd died I'd be like, "Well, at least the dog won't be getting poisoned anymore." Weird, ineffective and incongruous. Scandinavians.
/m/black_bear	e7dbc75a-44c2-3920-a4f8-1a209a4c5be9	3	Spoilers within: Somewhere between WTF and just how do any movies get made with so many moving and unruly parts, and immense egos liable to do anything on or off screen? It is a parody or black comedy more than black bear. When the bear finally shows up to apparently eat Aubrey whole, it is a metaphor for nature is going to win no matter how many movies we watch or don't. It was like woman meets married pregnant couple in a remote friendly house by the woods, and soon becomes woman goes after married man whose crazy pregnant wife (hold the alcohol, honey) flips out on hubby and girl found in flagrante delicto, resulting in apparent harm to the fetus as they all rush off for medical attention. Then the light bulb goes on and someone says let's end that shit here and do a satire of moviemaking after all, and on we go with quirky off-set types, and a movie star so bonkers she screws up the filming, while everyone at the shoot wrap says she done great. Is producer Aubrey saying what I think? That both moviemaking and movies are lucky they can find their asses with both hands? Or that when you are tired of  shootemups, boy meets girl, horror, FBI-CIA, Westerns and war sagas, try doing something, anything, that is different, new ground. A for creativity, C for moviegoing experience. I still like Aubrey and her quirky ways and characters. Sarah always classes up the place, even this one.
/m/black_bear	e7dbc75a-44c2-3920-a4f8-1a209a4c5be9	1.5	It's not nearly as complex as some would make it seem. It's not worth the runtime. I stopped caring before we even reached the end.
/m/black_bear	e7dbc75a-44c2-3920-a4f8-1a209a4c5be9	0.5	Literally just Hollywood patting itself on the back as it attempts to show us all how difficult it is to be a famous movie star.  By the end the only message being screamed through the screen is, "Look at all the drama and hard work we go through to bring you plebes movies!" Audrey Plaza was fantastic at the beginning of the film but by the end I had lost all connection to her character…. I was expecting some crazy twist at the to tie the two parts together, but I quickly saw through the facade and realized this was yet another film depicting the "elite" actors showing us just how out of touch with reality they actually are.
/m/black_bear	e7dbc75a-44c2-3920-a4f8-1a209a4c5be9	3.5	Lawrence Michael Levine's bizarre, ouroboric, perhaps even solipsistic, film is an odd one to crack but fascinating to experience and perfect for post-viewing debate in the bar. It's also one of the few rare occasions where it's beneficial to know a few minor spoilers beforehand so you're prepared going in. Essetially, it's a film of 2 halves that mirror each other and follow very similar narrative beats. Both involve a couple in some form of distress being tested by the arrival of a third party. In the first, Aubrey Plaza is a film-maker lodging with Christopher Abbott and Sarah Gadon's couple in their quiet and gorgeous lakehouse complex, where passive aggressive resentment simmers between the couple as sexual tensions brew between Plaza and Abbott. As the first story reaches a crushing climax, the film somersaults into the second, in the same location but constrastingly, it's awash with people making an indie film where the storyline is practically identical to the first story we've just seen. Abbott is the director and Plaza his star while Gadon plays the third party this time, both in the fictional film they're making and in Plaza's character's increasingly paranoid head. It's a visually striking film that covers multiple topics including feminism and the blurring line between reality and fiction, and also between art and life. The sprawling randomness of it all that would normally exasperate me, I find instead oddly and enigmatically appealing. Perhaps it's the finely drawn performances by the main trio, with Plaza on sensational form; or perhaps it's Levine's deft handling of the material which examines one of the oldest story in the book with such freshness and playfulness; either way, I was totally intrigued by this strange, dreamy film even if I've no idea what the black bear means.
/m/black_bear	e7dbc75a-44c2-3920-a4f8-1a209a4c5be9	1	Bravo to the cast, but this is writing is garbage. A play in two parts and one is significantly longer than the other? What's the point? There's no clear reason, logically or emotionally why this movie needed two parts that were tied together by wet spaghetti noodles. But the symbolism in red clothes! Give me a break, Schindler's List. And continuing on that theme, what was the point of showing us how these people were terrible to each other? Yeah, they suck pretty bad. So what? This read like a good 3rd draft of a college film thesis. Aubrey Plaza was phenomenal though, no cap. The rest of the cast too. They carried this Flintstone's car of a film.
/m/black_bear	e7dbc75a-44c2-3920-a4f8-1a209a4c5be9	5	Love this movie so much. Can’t wait to rewatch it. Whoever made it please keep making movies
/m/black_bear	e7dbc75a-44c2-3920-a4f8-1a209a4c5be9	1.5	I thought this was a terrible, terrible movie. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The best part was the scene with the main character with the red bathing suit on the dock. That was it. Great shot. Bravo. What happened to the writing?
/m/black_bear	e7dbc75a-44c2-3920-a4f8-1a209a4c5be9	3.5	Beautifully shot & acted, but there was just too much logic missing to be truly enjoyable. Although it's difficult to ever not enjoy watching Aubrey Plaza play any role.
/m/black_bear	e7dbc75a-44c2-3920-a4f8-1a209a4c5be9	1.5	The plot didn't make much sense to me.  Just not my thing I guess.
/m/black_bear	e7dbc75a-44c2-3920-a4f8-1a209a4c5be9	3	Aubrey Plaza was fantastic but the story just wasn't that interesting.
/m/beasts_clawing_at_straws	235eafc0-228d-33c0-8795-af0cb44b31d6	3.5	A fun crime thriller romp with serviceable direction albeit with some pacing issues. Black comedy elements are also present here but do not always hit the mark resulting in just a few chuckles. This movie will definitely satisfy the thirst of those looking for a film with direction and setting akin to Park Chan-wook's Vengeance trilogy, and Bong Joon Ho's Parasite. Viewers, however, should be very cautious as to not expect too much as they may come away disappointed when comparing this modest effort against heavyweights in the genre.
/m/beasts_clawing_at_straws	235eafc0-228d-33c0-8795-af0cb44b31d6	3.5	A wonderful harmony of actors Well-written script But, end of the ending is not good
/m/beasts_clawing_at_straws	235eafc0-228d-33c0-8795-af0cb44b31d6	4.5	The Korean black comedy you never knew you wanted!  Stay with this one as it comes together and mixes humor with violence very effectively.  The film is separated into six chapters.  Each chapter adds intrigue and a layer of confusion.  By the end it makes so much sense and it's a good time getting there.  Final Score: 9/10
/m/beasts_clawing_at_straws	235eafc0-228d-33c0-8795-af0cb44b31d6	3.5	With such talent in front and behind the camera, this very classic con/crime movie becomes instantly much more enjoyable than it was bound to be.
/m/beasts_clawing_at_straws	235eafc0-228d-33c0-8795-af0cb44b31d6	4	Guy Ritchie/Coen Brothers. Very Entertaining.
/m/beasts_clawing_at_straws	235eafc0-228d-33c0-8795-af0cb44b31d6	5	Once again, Korean filmmaker showing the rest of the world how to out-Hollywood Hollywood.
/m/beasts_clawing_at_straws	235eafc0-228d-33c0-8795-af0cb44b31d6	3.5	Twisty thriller that makes up for it's occasional unevenness with bodycount.
/m/beasts_clawing_at_straws	235eafc0-228d-33c0-8795-af0cb44b31d6	3	Wife's rating........
/m/beasts_clawing_at_straws	235eafc0-228d-33c0-8795-af0cb44b31d6	3	Easy to watch. Kind of Korean Tarantino.
/m/beasts_clawing_at_straws	235eafc0-228d-33c0-8795-af0cb44b31d6	4.5	One of my favorite thrillers of the year. Part "Parasite" and part Tarantino. Loved every minute of it!
/m/comfort_farms	6d15d61c-2a5d-4212-9999-7bbaf775a2d4	5	This is a great documentary that informs and educates while still entertaining.
/m/survival_skills	5c2f9536-d00d-4aa6-aecc-5a1b11f7342a	3.5	A lot more style over substance in this movie 3.3
/m/survival_skills	5c2f9536-d00d-4aa6-aecc-5a1b11f7342a	5	A fantastic film that I cannot think of any comparisons for.  So unique!
/m/survival_skills	5c2f9536-d00d-4aa6-aecc-5a1b11f7342a	4	Truly absurd but tragic in its own way, telling a story that doesn´t go the direction of silly jokes, but a rather confronting story about abuse, regret and dealing with the issues of the job.
/m/ammonite	044f69ac-6ffd-429f-9af8-4fce3d627c10	4	Beautifully crafted, but lacking a little in the full development of what drove the two lead characters to form such a strong, electrifying relationship... aside from a forbidden, restrained lust. This would have truly added more depth to the emotion and meaningfulness of the story
/m/ammonite	044f69ac-6ffd-429f-9af8-4fce3d627c10	0.5	5 minutes of lesbian action sandwiched in 2 hours of abject misery
/m/ammonite	044f69ac-6ffd-429f-9af8-4fce3d627c10	2.5	It feels like director searched around for a reason to make a lesbian porno and found Mary's story. The real claim to fame of Mary is lost in the sleaze and even movie states that part of her life is fictional so why add it? Most of movie is slow, dark and depressing with little to justify wasting that much time. Cannot understand why Winslet bothered.
/m/ammonite	044f69ac-6ffd-429f-9af8-4fce3d627c10	1	Hugely disappointing.  We learn very little about ammonites or fossil hunting in general.  This key aspect (and the only reason that I wanted to watch it) of the film is almost totally ignored.  Instead, most of the time it simply focusses on the 'relationship' between the two main female protagonists.   The whole fossil hunting side is almost incidental to the plot. If I wanted to see dramas about 'relationships' I can watch soaps on TV. Once again the audience is short-changed with a misleading title.  Sigh.....
/m/ammonite	044f69ac-6ffd-429f-9af8-4fce3d627c10	3.5	Pretty good but not exactly historically accurate - As my daughter said: She worked like a man in her time…so they decided to give her a wife.
/m/ammonite	044f69ac-6ffd-429f-9af8-4fce3d627c10	4.5	Winslet & Ronan, this one could not go wrong. The main sex scene is mindblowing.
/m/ammonite	044f69ac-6ffd-429f-9af8-4fce3d627c10	5	Spoilers: This asks the musical question: Who is fossilized here? The ancient animals or the two main characters, women? It reminded me of Margaret Qualley's take in 2017's "Novitiate." As a Catholic religious order novice, she eventually found the absence of physical love in the convent unbearable, and had an encounter with another novice -- it was as much for lack of love (I need to be touched!) than the lesbian sex that it was. In this movie, it was more that "nobody sees me," on an emotional level, as women in 19th-century England were pretty much ordered around and ignored by men. That led to Saoirse's "melancholia," as the rich older hubby in her loveless marriage put it.  Lower-class Kate was a paleontologist, of some faded note, resigned to her work, which she loved, and nothing else, as she lived with her Mum as she eked out a modest living finding and selling Kate's fossilized and polished finds by the sea in southern England, long after her Mum had 10 kids and lost eight of them as babies. It wasn't happiness central. But when the hubby asked Kate to look after his wife Saoirse for up to 6 weeks as she recovered from the melancholia that had her actually near death, and Kate complied for the dough, these two who pretty much just tolerated one another found each other. It started when Kate nursed her back to health, and Saoirse responded by opening up, smiling and being thankful for Kate's care. Then both shared more about whom they were, and then, bingo, on came the kissing, etc. Finally, someone saw and appreciated and loved both, and they were hungrier for that attention than anything. They "saw" each other, which was a rap on marriage, paternalism, economic, political and social realities, and a nod to feminism, as resourceful women can find ways to beat a system that leaves them emotionally unfulfilled, if not devastated. Then Saoirse went back to hubby, leaving both crushed. Then Kate traveled to Saoirse's big house at Saoirse's behest, and she asked Kate to move in. Kate saw it as a power move leaving out her daily work by the sea many miles away, so she walked off to a museum. The end was ambiguous, as they saw one another through glass containing one of Kate's most famous fossils. Do the people become hard like dead animals encased in rock? Seems Saoirse conceded she would come to Kate, it didn't have to be vice versa, as Saoirse would give up the good life to be with Kate. This was much more about loneliness, encased in the hard rock armor we build to keep it in, than about lesbian sex. It was about emotional fulfillment wherever you find it, even if both had learned to live with their loneliness, though it nearly killed Saoirse. So it is hopeful that people can be happy, even if eight siblings and Mum had died, and a loveless marriage had to end. Two great performances and wonderful nature and period-detail photography. Pretty fearless, too. A masterpiece or very close to one. The old saw: Woman does not live by bread alone.
/m/ammonite	044f69ac-6ffd-429f-9af8-4fce3d627c10	3	A lovely, accomplished piece of filmmaking, Ammonite nevertheless feels a bit stilted, rough hewn at times. It feels like it needs a final polishing and scraping to reveal more completely the story and the love of these characters for each other. Was too much time spent in the build up? Should we know more of why Mary is so detached, distant? No, that's not necessary as we know from Fiona Shaw's Elizabeth, Mary has long (always?) been this way, more or less. The first scenes of their kissing seemed more awkward, unconvincing than scenes of bursting passion. This may have been intentional to show what would be the more likely nature of their first physical sexual interactions. The most intense scene of the film is more convincing; enough so to change my sense of their attraction from earlier.  Ronan, Shaw and Jones are all fine, though Ronan shows she has some work to do to live up to the full challenge of her role. But Winslet is remarkable in bringing the very interesting, compelling Mary Anning to life on the screen. And she's also an actress who pulls off the extra weight well. She looks great, even without the manipulations of make-up and wardrobe.  This could've been great, but Lee was not as successful in this film in creating a fully convincing pair of lovers in love as he was in God's Own Country, 3.3 stars
/m/ammonite	044f69ac-6ffd-429f-9af8-4fce3d627c10	5	Beautiful film to watch, lots of subtle ways of how women have been overlooked and written out, and stylistically writing women back in. Very clever, and enjoyable to watch even when those things are overlooked. Wonderful movie, with much discussion afterwards!
/m/ammonite	044f69ac-6ffd-429f-9af8-4fce3d627c10	3.5	Winslet and Ronan are the entire movie, of course. The script leaves much to be desired, and the dialogue...better to ask, what dialogue? Overall, the film left much to discuss, that is a good thing. Such as what it potentially opens up in understanding the possibilities of women's love during these harsh times, in a world where women are not able to have access to sex, desire, and love in the ways that men have historically. Still, it left me unsatisfied.
/m/my_prince_edward	aab14ee1-4f8d-44fa-a7e8-f7fa7ec00641	3.5	While a very HK style movie, where the story about marriage is reflecting a life of a HK lady. The reconsideration of marriage meaning, and the side business which may be only happened in HK.
/m/dont_click_2020	e6605bc7-8b3d-4e7f-ad1d-a258d37da03d	1.5	This is not good acting and there is no great story here. It seems the makers are trying to pawn it off as a philosophical masterpiece and say this is some sort of artsy film. Way off, it ain't.  What we have is a shaggy Goosebumps episode about paranormal vengeance on creeps who watch violent, weirdo torture porno and a message from the dead lady Christmas past that you will be judged no matter if you produce it or watch it(consumer).  Since both are necessary to keep it alive.  It had some intriguing scenes but as a story thumbs down overall. It sadly missed the basic mark for me of producing an interesting plot worth watching . 1.5/5
/m/dont_click_2020	e6605bc7-8b3d-4e7f-ad1d-a258d37da03d	5	Very creepy movie! Catherine Howard is a true horror actress! She is able to show off her range of acting skills in this movie.
/m/dont_click_2020	e6605bc7-8b3d-4e7f-ad1d-a258d37da03d	5	Catherine Howard was the stand out in the film!! Definitely worth the watch!!
/m/dont_click_2020	e6605bc7-8b3d-4e7f-ad1d-a258d37da03d	0.5	Horrible acting, horrible writing, horrible everything. Don't waste your time.
/m/minor_premise	55ee0325-5fcc-45bf-bb41-b9586231dd8f	5	+ human, compassionate movie + interesting ref. the idea of having different selves making up our overall being, and of one self managing (or trying to manage) another self. Also the benefits of a blend of beings giving better overall results than one being alone. Perhaps also shows us the dangers of too simple models and of breaking things down too far. (- the postulated science seems to have no real basis in current scientific views of how we function.)  Overall very interesting - thank you for making it!
/m/minor_premise	55ee0325-5fcc-45bf-bb41-b9586231dd8f	2.5	I do like a good low budget sci-fi, and there's been some top drawer ones in the last few years. Primer (2004) was probably the film that got me interested in the sub-genre, and more recently The Invitation (2015) and my personal favourite, Coherence (2013). Although Minor Premise's premise (whey) is interesting (a neuroscientist becomes entangled in an experiment, pitting 10 fragments of his consciousness against each other) and it's well acted, it falls foul of poor execution, and a pay off you can see coming a mile off. It's worth a watch for the ideas, but there are better options out there.
/m/minor_premise	55ee0325-5fcc-45bf-bb41-b9586231dd8f	2	6 minutes per personality? What can you do with 6 minutes? Half baked idea, poorly expanded upon. Despite a tight 90 minute running time this movie drags in the middle as it fails to do anything interesting with its flawed premise. I like good sci fi and this isn't it.
/m/minor_premise	55ee0325-5fcc-45bf-bb41-b9586231dd8f	3	It never really sinks its teeth in. There are all these differing aspects of personality, but they're not explored to the degree that, at the end, you get a good idea where the whole thing stands. It's ends up fairly inconsequential. It's right at passing grade. Could have been much better.
/m/minor_premise	55ee0325-5fcc-45bf-bb41-b9586231dd8f	4.5	Very cool - total trip. The acting is really strong, especially two leads. Dug it, bigly.
/m/minor_premise	55ee0325-5fcc-45bf-bb41-b9586231dd8f	0.5	It is truly hard to believe that anyone can give any credence or merit to this endlessly enigmatic, pointless, and sorry affair. Does the protagonist really need to be unshaven and sweaty in every scene, and why so many closeups? And does the viewer really need to be left in the dark as to what the hell is going on? Perhaps because the screenwriter and director have no clue either. Just a lot of typing at the keyboard and a lot of other nonsense---making at the beginning, middle and end no sense whatsoever. Zzzz. A total bore.
/m/minor_premise	55ee0325-5fcc-45bf-bb41-b9586231dd8f	1.5	Really not sure who's rating these movies. The ratings I read are certainly inaccurate. Disappointed.  The acting, cinematography, plot, dialog, and stage were a D+ at best. However, if you have money to throw away & liked Santa Claus Conquers the Martians (1964), or Battlefield Earth (2000), maybe this is for you.
/m/minor_premise	55ee0325-5fcc-45bf-bb41-b9586231dd8f	4.5	Minor Premise is a major accomplishment. Eric Schultz's directorial debut is a taut sci-fi thriller chock-full of twists and turns. It's both fun and intellectual, with elements reminding me of Shane Carruth's Primer and Nacho Vigalondo's Timecrimes. And, then there is Sathya Sridharan's performance—put this guy in everything!
/m/minor_premise	55ee0325-5fcc-45bf-bb41-b9586231dd8f	4.5	Fantastic plot and backstory with a gripping performance by the leading man. Great production value!
/m/minor_premise	55ee0325-5fcc-45bf-bb41-b9586231dd8f	5	Wow! Felt like I was watching Momento again for the first time. Thought the premise would be very difficult to pull off for the lead but he nailed it and the supporting cast fit in perfectly. Awesome story!
/m/crock_of_gold_a_few_rounds_with_shane_macgowan	872d11bf-f292-39d5-9734-d736c1d4323f	5	Fue sensacional, muy emotivo,  gran amistad de MacGowan y Depp,  gran homenaje.
/m/crock_of_gold_a_few_rounds_with_shane_macgowan	872d11bf-f292-39d5-9734-d736c1d4323f	5	Incredible. *chef kiss* 👏👏

/m/crock_of_gold_a_few_rounds_with_shane_macgowan	872d11bf-f292-39d5-9734-d736c1d4323f	5	One word to describe this: INCREDIBLE.
/m/crock_of_gold_a_few_rounds_with_shane_macgowan	872d11bf-f292-39d5-9734-d736c1d4323f	4.5	Brilliant & unguarded doc on an essential Irish poet. This is a pretty great place to start if you aren't too aware of Shane. But Johnny Depp & his fake accent once again wear out their welcome when the only truthful human is the one the documentary is about.
/m/crock_of_gold_a_few_rounds_with_shane_macgowan	872d11bf-f292-39d5-9734-d736c1d4323f	5	A wonderful tribute to one of the greatest!
/m/crock_of_gold_a_few_rounds_with_shane_macgowan	872d11bf-f292-39d5-9734-d736c1d4323f	5	I loved every minute of it. A fabulous tribute to the great man.
/m/crock_of_gold_a_few_rounds_with_shane_macgowan	872d11bf-f292-39d5-9734-d736c1d4323f	4.5	A great movie about a great man. Shane is Faffe 🍺👍🏼
/m/crock_of_gold_a_few_rounds_with_shane_macgowan	872d11bf-f292-39d5-9734-d736c1d4323f	5	Great, vibrant portrait of the legendary Shane McGowan. Watched it twice.
/m/archenemy	b070ff7e-b71f-31c3-8e61-56c3c32dd4b7	1.5	Trust the audience reviews. Like a 1970s TV movie.
/m/archenemy	b070ff7e-b71f-31c3-8e61-56c3c32dd4b7	3	Joe Manganiello gives a great performance, everyone else not so much. Story was interesting but it ended just as it was getting good in my opinion.
/m/archenemy	b070ff7e-b71f-31c3-8e61-56c3c32dd4b7	1.5	a complete waste of time even if you watch it in fast forward. "Keep moving - Nothing to see here folks."
/m/archenemy	b070ff7e-b71f-31c3-8e61-56c3c32dd4b7	4	It was different and more complex than first thought, the almost anti hero approach. I found several characters very relatable.
/m/archenemy	b070ff7e-b71f-31c3-8e61-56c3c32dd4b7	2	It's bad but I'm happy someone worked hard to make it because it was worth a few chuckles.
/m/archenemy	b070ff7e-b71f-31c3-8e61-56c3c32dd4b7	0.5	I can’t believe I finish this bad movie - but then again I’m doing some computer errands so it just played on the background
/m/archenemy	b070ff7e-b71f-31c3-8e61-56c3c32dd4b7	3.5	This movie was one long fever dream.  The world building all being animated was a turn off, you could tell they ran out of money. Joe M. is pretty believable as an "alien" in this though.   I wish they either leaned into the action or into the ridiculousness one way or the other.
/m/archenemy	b070ff7e-b71f-31c3-8e61-56c3c32dd4b7	2.5	another bad ending ruins the rating, good absolutely nothing else to watch movie if you haven't seen it
/m/archenemy	b070ff7e-b71f-31c3-8e61-56c3c32dd4b7	3.5	Dont expect a big budget marvel movie, this was made for a fraction of the cost. Decent performances all around but the story about the two siblings is kinda weak overall, which is a shame cos its the main driving force for the protagonist. But the question of whether he is or isnt a superhero is just about enough to make you stick with it and you will be rewarded with some decent action sequences and like i said some good performances all around, regardless of whether the plot feel a bit meh. Its better earlier than later, where i think it kinda cops out a bit with the ending, which is basically sequel bait which kinda craps on its own rules if you give it literally any thought at all. Its not at all hard to follow though so not sure why some people raised this. It literally only asks one question the entire movie, and the rest is your basic ganster goes after drug dealer who is really nice so we are supposed to root for them even though they sell crack to kids movie. Overall its a decent movie between the marvel and dc offerings while waiting for those
/m/archenemy	b070ff7e-b71f-31c3-8e61-56c3c32dd4b7	1	Stinks!  Stinks!  Stinks!
/m/love_weddings_and_other_disasters	bb1ccb88-9445-4a67-b5bd-c1044451d764	2	I found it challenging to stay engaged with so many apparent disparate story lines. The Audio Description volume was much louder than the film soundtrack which was very distracting/challenging. The story & dialogue seemed a bit stilted and clumsy.
/m/love_weddings_and_other_disasters	bb1ccb88-9445-4a67-b5bd-c1044451d764	0.5	Dreadful. Awful. On every scale. Waste of time. Not funny. Not clever. Not witty. Not worth it. Irons and Keaton just needed the money. Shameful
/m/love_weddings_and_other_disasters	bb1ccb88-9445-4a67-b5bd-c1044451d764	3	Of course, it was not the best movie with mini-stories that turn out to be connected (those are still the ones made by Garry Marshall), and at times it was a little stupid, but it was still entertaining. We were laughing out loud at the physical comedy! I also found it fun that it was filmed in Boston - I even spotted bottles of Bully Boy at the bar!
/m/love_weddings_and_other_disasters	bb1ccb88-9445-4a67-b5bd-c1044451d764	2.5	It's a sweet, silly and light comedy. If you don't mind the too frequent exaggerations and just want to forget the pandemic having a few good laughs you might enjoy this collage of stories and scenes. I left lighthearted and with a smile on my face.  5 1/2 of 10 points.
/m/love_weddings_and_other_disasters	bb1ccb88-9445-4a67-b5bd-c1044451d764	5	I can see why this movie is not for everyone, but I found it to be an easy, feel-good watch. My family and I laughed the whole way through. Would recommend if you like this type of romantic comedy.
/m/love_weddings_and_other_disasters	bb1ccb88-9445-4a67-b5bd-c1044451d764	5	We didn't stop laughing the entire time
/m/love_weddings_and_other_disasters	bb1ccb88-9445-4a67-b5bd-c1044451d764	3	Bit of a waste of two huge talents, Irons and Keaton, who only had small roles, even though the trailer made it look like the film was about them.
/m/love_weddings_and_other_disasters	bb1ccb88-9445-4a67-b5bd-c1044451d764	0.5	walked out half way through, would have left earlier but thought "It has to get better" but it didn't.
/m/love_weddings_and_other_disasters	bb1ccb88-9445-4a67-b5bd-c1044451d764	2	I really like Diane Keaton and watched it to see her but this character did not have enough depth. The whole idea that someone that fired 4 wedding planners before Jessie but they love everything she does isn't realistic. The movie is a Disney style fantasy and is so predictable. Acting was still good though.
/m/love_weddings_and_other_disasters	bb1ccb88-9445-4a67-b5bd-c1044451d764	3.5	Very light romantic comedy. Liked the opening wedding party scene and game show segments the best!
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	3.5	Another fun continuation to this low-budget, but impressive looking sci-fi/action series. It doesn't add much new to the story, but it's a good time. It's funny how much the two sequels surpass the original, when that's the one that had soo much potential...
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	2.5	A low budget sci-fi film that tries to be bolder than it can and bring some importance to itself even though it has overblown action sequences that look more terrible than cool and literally throws away its plot into the basic pile. The acting is decent and works for the fans of this franchise but it just muddled up in a mildy entertaining mess.
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	4	Saw previous 2 movies of this triad. The trailers looked good CGI wise. Although I was a bit septic in the beginning, due to episode 1 & 2, I gave it a shot. Bought the Blu ray and watched.  The characters are ok. Acting was above average. The main female character was good in my opinion. Facial expressions are in sync with the situation. Sometimes the acting is not according to expectations, not because of the actor, but how the director is allowing certain scenes to be processed. For instance, the scene with the female doctor teaching a girl to shoot. She just learned to shoot and hardly had any trouble gunning down aliens, who supposed to be ruthless. In my opinion that could be dramatized a little bit more, to make it more believable. Owens (older guy) was acting nicely, and his fighting techniques are good, did not see that coming. Some characters have relationships and when something happens to the other I expected a bit of emotions there, but that was not present. And and some moments there were emotions, like the part where one character could not continue and had to left behind. That part was a bit too far stretched, should have kept it short and having danger arriving fast. Then it would be more dramatic and the drama, tears, etc would have been in a better setting.  The added graphics are pretty good. I am a fan of CGI, as it makes things possible that are normally difficult to do in  real life. without comparing with Top A films, This movies deserves a 7/10 for CGI.  Movie props, The arm attached blade for our Heroine is a bit too bulky for my taste. If they added CGI effect like glow it it, that would be nice.  The aliens are dressed in suites that are created as one piece of mold of plastic. Details are not bad, but I sense no weight when their feet touch the ground, as they are weightless.   At one of the scenes when our main Heroine was locked into the room with another person, I was thinking, that it was planned and something was going to happen, but alas nothing earth chattering. some scenes created an expectation that something is going to happen, but then nothing happens. a bit of a let down. Or it is just me to expect too many things.  The story is ok, with twists thank you. It was not entirely transparent and predictable all the way.    Would I see skylines 4 if there were one? Yes, enjoyed the movie. I don't get it when people give it a mere 1 star. Did they really looked at the movie and tried to enjoy it. or was it a comparison to Marvel movies? Budget wise Skylines is a much lower budget. And Europe , I am sorry, Great britain I mean, is doing pretty well in the world of movies. Hope they continue creating better and better CGI movies. Bring Skylines 4 please, love to see the characters and the heroine again. Cheers. I own many many movies. This one is going into my Blu-ray shelf.
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	0.5	Some of the worst acting I've ever seen, turned off movie half way through.
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	3	It might have helped if I'd seen the two previous films; however, as a standalone film this was very weak indeed. I ended up fast forwarding a lot of the middle section as it was boring.
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	2	A waste of time unless all you want are mediocre special effects.
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	3.5	so, this took me a couple tries to finish.  Something about the middle made me fall asleep so many times.  A bit of a disappointment considering I really enjoyed the 2nd film but it's still a nice ending to a somewhat impressive alien trilogy
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	2	Not a good watch, won't watch again, and can't recommend.  I was so excited to see Lindsey Morgan (Raven, "The 100") in a thing, and a cool looking alien dystopian thing at that.  They almost immediate thrashed my dreams.  Apparently there is an entirely "better" movie that we skipped to get to this one, and even that one was pretty odd.  Ripping brains out of human heads to use as bio PCs for alien androids is just odd.  It's not good, but it's not really that bad, just weird.  The movie we do get is more of a alien fantasy story as opposed to the typical science fiction story with psychic/super powers, unnecessary and awkward aliens that only add subtitles.  It sort of becomes "The Matrix" after a bit, but just a lot stranger feeling.
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	0.5	The initial opening to the movie was bland, with a plain and prosaic storyline. There was no need for most film characters, as there was no other purpose and no story arc for the remaining characters. Other characters were too evident in their goals to the "bad guy" plot. The protagonists' character development was vague at best, and at worst, the characters were perceived by the audience as dull and confusing. This was mainly because of the confusing and obvious plot twists. Additionally, there were too many plot holes that could have been solved more straightforwardly. Overall this is not a movie I would recommend to other audiences to a great extent.
/m/skylines	4664b312-4f81-3bd8-a8f5-fcfb5b246f5b	3.5	I've seen all three; this is by far the best. If you like sci-fi FX and can tolerate sci-fi tropes, this is kind of Tomb Raider in Space.  The female hero's journey works for me.   Writing and acting is a few notches above TV movie, except physical sets and VFX which are close to AAA.  The making-of feature reinforces the impression morale on set was high, always a good foundation for a fun watch.
/m/what_lies_below_2020	38cbbbe0-e7b6-4566-a310-1307799896c6	0.5	I could tell there was something fishy about Trey because his teeth. 100% cobblers.
/m/what_lies_below_2020	38cbbbe0-e7b6-4566-a310-1307799896c6	5	It was creepy and awesome.
/m/what_lies_below_2020	38cbbbe0-e7b6-4566-a310-1307799896c6	0.5	This is the worst movie I've seen recently. Bad acting especially from the main actress (that plays liberty). Confusing and terrible plot, Awful Script (lines). Don't waste your time watching this
/m/what_lies_below_2020	38cbbbe0-e7b6-4566-a310-1307799896c6	1	I have watched some bad films in my time but this film and its ending was the worst one of all. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS RUBBISH
/m/what_lies_below_2020	38cbbbe0-e7b6-4566-a310-1307799896c6	0.5	Give me back 2 hours of my life!!! Worst movie ever seen on Netflix, very bad photography and even for a Sci fy it was unrealistically made if that makes any sense. No plot... bad acting just really bad
/m/what_lies_below_2020	38cbbbe0-e7b6-4566-a310-1307799896c6	0.5	By far, the stupidest movie I've seen in 10 years. Totally sickening boat scene, very disturbing... wtf Netflix
/m/what_lies_below_2020	38cbbbe0-e7b6-4566-a310-1307799896c6	4	It's truly a small but surprising movie. It begins as a typical domestic thriller but eventually transitions into something Lovecraft-lite. It's short running time makes it an enjoyable watch.
/m/what_lies_below_2020	38cbbbe0-e7b6-4566-a310-1307799896c6	4	The movie is on the slower side but grippy enough to hold your attention. A lot of people hated it but it's a good starcast, good acting, very well shot and worth a one time watch.
/m/what_lies_below_2020	38cbbbe0-e7b6-4566-a310-1307799896c6	1	Omg terrible! Let me explain..... first off wtf who wrote this, like there wasn't a real conclusion.... literally NO POINT TO THIS MOVIE. Bad acting the guy JOHN ... just no it is just the music that makes his parts feel good. Like it seems like he has his lines right there and reading them. The girl doesn't warn anyone except for later in the movie about what happened on the boat. That was the worst thing ever.... like if someone licked my period blood ! I would f***ing jump off the boat and call 911. Bad visual effects, some parts they sped them up on like 3x. And with the car .... nooooooo  I can't . Watch if you want though
/m/what_lies_below_2020	38cbbbe0-e7b6-4566-a310-1307799896c6	3	i actually didn't think this was too bad. the guy that plays John played his part very well; i think the story works & even though the foreshadowing hits you right between the eyes, there's still a little bit of surprise at the end. i enjoyed this one overall.
/m/knuckledust	c19b7f61-ccd8-3220-97c5-2a6cc27c4d2e	2	Was ok film not brilliant or terrible just ok but was ruined by loud music & tunes playing in background too often as well as being louder then actors talking so couldn't hear most of what said.
/m/knuckledust	c19b7f61-ccd8-3220-97c5-2a6cc27c4d2e	2.5	Wonderfully stylish and whilst I did love the film style, I felt for me that the style overshadowed the plot which then took me out of the movie.  Cleary made by a talented crew, but I just couldn't gel with this film.

/m/smiley_face_killers	cd3ac639-6d41-421b-bb4a-c4745b293688	1	Nothing much happens for an hour and the plot is weak.
/m/smiley_face_killers	cd3ac639-6d41-421b-bb4a-c4745b293688	0.5	This movie sucked so bad I actually kept skipping forward to see if their was even one descent scene. Nope it all sucked. I was expecting a serial killer movie instead it was about some lame college kid being a wimp around his girlfriend and getting stupid threats on his cellphone! I could have made  a better serial killer movie in my sleep.
/m/smiley_face_killers	cd3ac639-6d41-421b-bb4a-c4745b293688	0.5	The best acting came from Crispin Glover, and he didn't have any lines. The main actor was terrible. Don't waste your time!
/m/smiley_face_killers	cd3ac639-6d41-421b-bb4a-c4745b293688	0.5	Put this one back on whatever shelf you found it and burn that shelf. This is the most boring non slasher movie.
/m/smiley_face_killers	cd3ac639-6d41-421b-bb4a-c4745b293688	1	As bad as everyone says.
/m/smiley_face_killers	cd3ac639-6d41-421b-bb4a-c4745b293688	2.5	Movie: bad. Ronen Rubinstein: good.
/m/smiley_face_killers	cd3ac639-6d41-421b-bb4a-c4745b293688	3	My boy Jake deserved better.
/m/smiley_face_killers	cd3ac639-6d41-421b-bb4a-c4745b293688	0.5	A waste of time. Bad acting . Go watch Happy Face Killer instead.
/m/smiley_face_killers	cd3ac639-6d41-421b-bb4a-c4745b293688	3.5	This movie is a mess to put it lightly but I do love Ronen so.
/m/smiley_face_killers	cd3ac639-6d41-421b-bb4a-c4745b293688	0.5	After seeing this movie, I don't think I'll ever understand why it got such a good score from the audience. The whole movie was a depressed guy living his day to day life, and he was killed by members of a cult. No elaborate chase scene or fight for the film's climax. Just a pathetic attempt by him to survive by going to a gas station. Literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
/m/dear_santa_2020	59a3bfd9-2227-3ede-869e-333ca2be13b2	2.5	Sweet, yet meandering and unfocused, 'Dear Santa' is best when it sticks to the inner workings of how generous people are able to get presents to thousands of needy children and families.  Unless you're a grinch, it never gets old seeing a child getting something they so desperately wanted.  It does seem like there are some 'needy' people living in some nice houses, but there are clearly holes in the giving system.  Anyone can write a letter to Santa from poor to rich and it's hard to decipher what's what.  Despite the drawbacks, we still get plenty of good vibes and smiles and we all can use that!  Final Score: 5/10
/m/wild_mountain_thyme	e26ca786-2c20-3468-9687-5ba21a7e4ef6	0.5	Offensive. Irish culture is misappropriated with such fake accents and hammed up script.
/m/wild_mountain_thyme	e26ca786-2c20-3468-9687-5ba21a7e4ef6	2	Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees And the flowers and the trees And the moon up above And a thing called "maintaining a believable Irish accent for the entire runtime"
/m/wild_mountain_thyme	e26ca786-2c20-3468-9687-5ba21a7e4ef6	3.5	It was a bit slow and melodramatic. All together a decent movie.
/m/wild_mountain_thyme	e26ca786-2c20-3468-9687-5ba21a7e4ef6	4	I generally agree with reviews by RT critics, but not this time. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie, thought the cast was wonderfully cast, and even though several plotlines were utterly predictable, every once in a while it's good to escape into an unabashed love story.
/m/wild_mountain_thyme	e26ca786-2c20-3468-9687-5ba21a7e4ef6	1.5	I wanted to like this movie…. I couldn’t. It felt as though it was trying to be really deep, but yet it stayed very superficial with all its characters; making it hard to connect with any of them. There was a really sweet scene with Christopher Walker and Jamie’s character… I think it was one of Jamie’s best performances, but other that.. it was poo.
/m/wild_mountain_thyme	e26ca786-2c20-3468-9687-5ba21a7e4ef6	1	One of the worst film that I've ever seen!  I was fall asleep on it 3 times, the fake Irish accent is annoying . The conversations are unreal, the stereotypes are ridiculous... I live in Ireland for 4 years now, I live with an irish man, and the whole film is just a 🐂💩...
/m/wild_mountain_thyme	e26ca786-2c20-3468-9687-5ba21a7e4ef6	2	This film was hugely disappointing, especially with it having such a great cast, all the good bit of the film are in the trailer for the film.
/m/wild_mountain_thyme	e26ca786-2c20-3468-9687-5ba21a7e4ef6	3	Enjoyed the fake Irishness of it. Amusing little romance, Emily Blunt completely steals the show, which I am sure nobody will be surprised about. Not a great plot but it is given life. You too, will want to murder her costar.
/m/wild_mountain_thyme	e26ca786-2c20-3468-9687-5ba21a7e4ef6	4	I thought this was a very entertaining romantic (comedy) movie. Love the Irish scenery and accents and Irish culture! Love Emily Blunt and Jamie Dornan! Fun movie if you like Ireland!
/m/wild_mountain_thyme	e26ca786-2c20-3468-9687-5ba21a7e4ef6	3.5	If you're in the mood to watch a sweet,  feel good movie...then watch wild mountain thyme 😊
/m/baby_god	f4bd50d9-ff64-4b3e-9bb2-5b5cd1d7b770	1	The music is absolutely intolerable. I would like to have continued watching this but absolutely could not. It was not interesting enough to endure the assault on my ears.
/m/baby_god	f4bd50d9-ff64-4b3e-9bb2-5b5cd1d7b770	3	Really disturbing story but still felt overly long at 78 minutes as I think viewers will be left with some unanswered questions. I would have been interested to see more digging into of the history and psychology of the type of sociopathic doctor who can internally justify this type of behavior.
/m/elyse	4f77f66a-0c40-3938-ab98-b70d27dbdcbe	0.5	It is past awful. Where did they get these actors? They are the worst actors ever seen.  People in soap operas deserve Academy Awards compared to the actors in this movie. You've got to assume the director is a relation of some sort to Anthony Hopkins because there's no other reason on this earth why he would be in should an awful movie; story, script, dialogue, acting. It's hard to list whose acting is worse but Elyse and her husband both compete for worst actor and I think he wins. It's too much trouble to look up the relationship of Stella Hopkins to Anthony Hopkins but no relative deserves to ruin a career.
/m/elyse	4f77f66a-0c40-3938-ab98-b70d27dbdcbe	0.5	This movie is a slog with a ridiculous premise.  It was predictable and painful to watch.  I want my 90 minutes back.
/m/elyse	4f77f66a-0c40-3938-ab98-b70d27dbdcbe	1	Don't bother. It made me sad to see Anthony Hopkins in such a poor movie.
/m/the_stand_in_2020	55c3f38a-723c-342b-91ed-bccff3b23f01	3	The Stand In is a dark comedy drama that a returning Barrymore carries in multiple roles. We hope to see more of her soon. It's by no means laugh-out-loud funny but it still stands in as watchable fun.
/m/the_stand_in_2020	55c3f38a-723c-342b-91ed-bccff3b23f01	0.5	It's safe to say that Jaime Babbit is one of the worst mainstream directors in Hollywood! Every single movie she directed sucked!! And she's still getting paid to make this kind of shit?! Sign me up! I'd be more than happy to take a shit on any idiot willing to watch the same trite being dished out from Hollywood!
/m/the_stand_in_2020	55c3f38a-723c-342b-91ed-bccff3b23f01	2	Decent watch at best, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.  This is an interesting twist on the substitution trope, but it uses two awful people on both sides.  It really feels like a movie made for actors and it is supposed to shine a light on the perception of a person and the reality of a person.  Even starting with a down on her luck, kind, nobody shows how she can grow into a monster just like any other person with a taste of power.  Maybe it just changes who the victim is.  Once that becomes apparent, it's just sort of "How far are they going to push it?".
/m/the_stand_in_2020	55c3f38a-723c-342b-91ed-bccff3b23f01	1	I was so excited to see this one. It looked so fun and dumb from the ads, and I was fully expecting to have a good time.  I turned this one off pretty early. My husband and I noticed there is a dark realness Drew is bringing to Candy Black in this, and the whole tone is sad. Normally, you'd compliment an actress for bringing her realness into comedy, but maybe it's that the premise is campy, and the characters are campy, but there's a real river of Drew Barrymore's past running through it?  I'm sorry, Drew. I have too much empathy for you as a woman to get through this one. I still love you, though.
/m/the_stand_in_2020	55c3f38a-723c-342b-91ed-bccff3b23f01	4	Adding a star for effort for everyone who obviously worked hard on this. I liked the realistic portrayal of the artifice of celebrity culture, social media, and culture in general, viewed through the lens of celebrities and those who surround them, with the emptiness of modern values demonstrated nicely by the choice Candy's agent's makes at a crucial point in Candy's life. As a treatment of values that need to be examined, it deserves much credit.
/m/the_stand_in_2020	55c3f38a-723c-342b-91ed-bccff3b23f01	2.5	Good premise, but not a funny result.
/m/the_stand_in_2020	55c3f38a-723c-342b-91ed-bccff3b23f01	0.5	Que porqueria A Drew le salían machos sapos por la boca.
/m/the_stand_in_2020	55c3f38a-723c-342b-91ed-bccff3b23f01	0.5	Worst film I’ve seen in 2021. Drew is ok as the stand-in, terrible as the actress, feels out of place in NewYork, thematically doesn’t fly (fame and money destroys the soul) and the screenplay is neither funny nor poignant. I didn’t even mention that the feasibility of the premise is ludicrous....
/m/the_stand_in_2020	55c3f38a-723c-342b-91ed-bccff3b23f01	1.5	I grew up watching Drew Barrymore movies & as with a lot of Adam Sandler's latest films, along with owning their own production companies & being aligned with Netflix, it seems to allow them to make unbelievably terrible films; The Stand In being a prime example. I could deal with her playing dual roles but the dull story line and subject matter was difficult to endure.
/m/the_stand_in_2020	55c3f38a-723c-342b-91ed-bccff3b23f01	4	I don't think people understood the meaning of the movie, but if you do you know it's great and I think people were wanting more comedy but it was more of a meaningful movie with some comedic scenes!
/m/the_ventures_stars_on_guitars	690b9fed-a212-348a-8814-2b10e67717be	5	Great music doc! Educational as well as very fun to watch. The Ventures are the greatest guitar band ever, their hits will stand the test of tame. Film includes terrific interviews with many famous pop stars, even Venture fan Billy Bob Thornton. Highly recommended!
/m/ip_man_kung_fu_master	4efca424-0a55-4e0b-bd45-646b302d5b88	1	I lasted maybe 30 minutes. the fight scenes are all jump cuts, i have no idea what happened ...
/m/ip_man_kung_fu_master	4efca424-0a55-4e0b-bd45-646b302d5b88	1	Filme horrível, história tosca, lutas ruins e fantasiosas demais. Nem se compara a nenhum filme com o Donnie yen
/m/ip_man_kung_fu_master	4efca424-0a55-4e0b-bd45-646b302d5b88	3	March 3, 2021 (NYC)– A Look at Ip Man: Kung Fu Master (2021). Ip Man: Kung Fu Master (2021), the latest film in a series of stories about the life and legacy of Bruce Lee's legendary Wing Chu Master, Ip Man, hits the US market this week. Here is a synopsis and review of this Magnolia Pictures, Magnet Release.  SYNOPSIS:  IP MAN: KUNG FU MASTER harks back to Ip's early days before the Communist Revolution in 1949. Ip, portrayed by Dennis To for the third time as the martial artist who famously tutored Bruce Lee, was then a police captain who was framed for the murder of a ruthless but honorable mobster, and targeted for vengeance by his dangerous daughter.  Forced to quit the force, Ip soon also has to contend with the arrival of the Japanese army in Guangzhou.  REVIEW:  To be clear this is not part of the highly successful four part, Donnie Yen, series about the Chinese, Wing Chun legend.   However, it is based upon the same character.    It seems Ip Man has become one of the 21st Century's great Chinese, global exports and the world can not get enough of these action packed, loosely based bio-pics.    This film is a prequel of sorts to the Wilson Yip, Donnie Yen blockbusters.  It takes place prior to the original Yen film, in the years that Ip Man was a police officer in Foshan Province.  Ip Man goes on a personal mission to avenge an unjust death and to stand up to the invasive presence of the Japanese military.  For those looking for more of Donnie Yen and the triumphant filmmaking of the four (4) unrelated films, you may be disappointed.  However, for those looking to revisit this beloved character in a fun, action packed movie that is cinematically pleasing, this film is a winner.  It is engaging from the opening action packed fight scene to the final battle, which is a sort of homage' to the end of Yen's first Ip Man foray.     While Dennis To is not Donnie Yen, neither is any other living martial arts action star.   Dennis To manages to  do a good job of carrying the film.   He resembles Yen in his persona and in his fighting.   Early on I wasn't sure if he was doing a Yen impression, or they both simply, had similar demeanors and movements, but I quickly became engrossed enough that I stopped caring.   His acting works.  His martial arts is high level. To's claim to fame is that he was an actual student of Ip Chun, Ip Man's son. Chun, who worked with Yen on his Ip Man film, was actually Dennis To's teacher and Grandmaster.  This accounts for his adept martial arts skills.  This film surprised me and I think it will surprise martial arts film fans, whether you have seen other Ip Man films or not.  I recommend it highly.
/m/ip_man_kung_fu_master	4efca424-0a55-4e0b-bd45-646b302d5b88	3	Overall, this film is a must-watch for fans and followers of the well-known legend, Ip Man. The film contains a basic plot and thankfully feels more like a prequel.  The film's visuals, particularly during the fight scenes, certainly do not disappoint. The film's plot also has a few nice twists and turns which were quite surprising to see. In the end, this instalment is certainly an uplifting film as Ip Man wrestles with many elements all occurring at once. Some of these elements include fear, faith, sacrifice and dignity.  Pleasing for both current fans and those being introduced to the series - Walkden Entertainment
/m/ip_man_kung_fu_master	4efca424-0a55-4e0b-bd45-646b302d5b88	4.5	Donny Yen comes through again.  The fight sequences are excellent as always.
/m/ip_man_kung_fu_master	4efca424-0a55-4e0b-bd45-646b302d5b88	1.5	Yikes...this movie didn't need to be made. Strip away Donnie Yen (previously played Ip Man), a semblance of a plot, and good fight choreography, and this is what you end up with.
/m/paint	eb8cafde-3c1b-4f54-9c33-ee2566349f98	5	Better than most crap out there.  By a lot.  I thought this film was smart and it made me laugh a lot.  Definitely not a Hollywood movie though.
/m/paint	eb8cafde-3c1b-4f54-9c33-ee2566349f98	5	Crazy that hardly anyone knows about this movie.  So funny and good!
/m/paint	eb8cafde-3c1b-4f54-9c33-ee2566349f98	5	Really loved this.  The whole thing.
/m/paint	eb8cafde-3c1b-4f54-9c33-ee2566349f98	5	My brother told me about this movie, so I rented it.  I had a lot of laughs.  Olivia Luccardi is really great in it.
/m/paint	eb8cafde-3c1b-4f54-9c33-ee2566349f98	5	I get why this movie won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Feature Film at Dances with Films.  If you're a fan of Indie dark comedies, you'll enjoy PAINT.
/m/paint	eb8cafde-3c1b-4f54-9c33-ee2566349f98	5	I watched this because DPK was in it; he's really great in it!  Loved this dark comedy.
/m/paint	eb8cafde-3c1b-4f54-9c33-ee2566349f98	4.5	Really funny film.  I'm an artist so I gravitated towards it.  Suggest watch it!
/m/paint	eb8cafde-3c1b-4f54-9c33-ee2566349f98	5	A must see movie about artists trying to make it in the sleazy NYC art scene.
/m/paint	eb8cafde-3c1b-4f54-9c33-ee2566349f98	5	Paint is a terrific film. Such wonderfully quirky characters, so well drawn and acted. It's a riveting, often funny, story about young millennial artists, each navigating the difficult and competitive art world in New York and struggling with how to fit in, or not.
/m/paint	eb8cafde-3c1b-4f54-9c33-ee2566349f98	5	Rarely is a movie or a TV series for me when I hear my Gen X children and Gen Z grandchildren raving. But my curiosity got the best of me and I have to admit I'm glad.  I loved the characters, laughed at their hi-jinx, and felt for their struggles. Fantastic actors I'd of course never heard of, along with a terrific music soundtrack, and I was blown away (I think I'm again showing my age) by the Art—the collage of bright, speeding colors, authentic city backgrounds, and mad graffiti.   Most of all—and so unexpectedly—I laughed and laughed. So I've been raving to other old-fart friends, all of whom seem to agree. Congratulations whoever you people are!
/m/modern_persuasion	e1b5e380-eafa-3ca7-9eea-b505f5dd96a2	3.5	I came with low expectations, because of other reviews.  I decided to not pay for a viewing.  It's finally on Hulu.  This movie was more fun than I anticipated, but I'm a sucker for any film adaptation of Jane Austin.
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	5	Indispensable piece of RnR history. Fun and insightful
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	4	excellent film...saw it via Prime Video, but would like a DVD copy...anyone know if/when it will be released on DVD???
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	5	It was great. In Boy Howdy We Trust.
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	4.5	I grew up reading CREEM, literally. I was born in 1972 and reading by the age of 3. I was obsessed with music and probably first saw CREEM from my parents at a very young age. I learned so much from that magazine and honestly the documentary showed me even more. I always wondered about that bunch beyond Lester Bangs (as I have read his books and Jim Dero's book) and this film showed it all. I literally waited a year to see it, tweeting the magazine demanding it's release, and rented it immediately. I want to own this on DVD and am excited for the 50th anniversary issue. This is a must see for any music fan. So well done.
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	5	The best Roc Doc I've seen!! A rock ‘n' roll magazine for the people and I'm so glad on its return. I look forward to what they do next!
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	5	Inspiring and fun to watch the music industry at a time when there where so many incredible artist. Refreshing to see a female perspective on being a journalist during that time too.
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	5	Better than Star Wars! My expectations were high, as a high school Creem junkie, and it does not disappoint. Wish it ran longer to include the Bill Holdship years but I think it makes for a better film to end it where they do. A+!
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	5	A must for any classic rock / punk fan. While everyone has heard of bad boy rock journalist Lester Bangs, there were many more who played instrumental roles and are a given the spotlight in this documentary.  Nice mix of archival footage mixed with "talking head" style recollections.  For a documentary, it cooks along and you're instantly engaged.
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	5	Creem had something special going for it, and the movie really conveyed that - this was a family affair, with a core, passionate group of wacky and smart people that loved what they were doing, where they were doing it (Detroit), and seemed like they were (mostly) having fun. In this day and age of print mags continuing to shutter, and rock journalism becoming a thing of the past (do the kids even know about Lester Bangs anymore?), this was a really nice reminder of what once was…..A no-holds barred, don't give a fuck attitude magazine that covered music that other people didn't care about (yet). The ability to reflect on cool shit that happened and speak to the people involved while they are for the most part still alive is why people make documentaries. The tale was told well, and made me wish I had some copies to flip through. I might have to track down some back issues…oh wait, I just pre-ordered the 50th anniversary commemorative issue AND a t-shirt. What are you doing today? Nothing, right? What a perfect day to watch.
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	5	Loved this doc about a magazine that was so important to music fans in the Seventies and Eighties. The iconoclastic CREEM was the alternative to the staid Rolling Stone, and this film captures a good deal of the energy of the era and those who wrote for the mag. Breezy, informative, and full of rock history, this doc is a pleasure to watch.
/m/princess_of_the_row	0e0cb337-2bca-3c1f-aa31-776b3cd98628	1.5	Just as I figured: not a single negative review. For who would rate this well-meaning mess as rotten; it would indicate not having a heart, right? Not being sensitive to the plight of the homeless and mentally ill. This film is basically homeless/Skid Row porn, with a father character made up to look grotesque and monster-like (was the whitened eye even necessary? Geez!); he's so severely mentally ill that he would barely recognize the daughter in reality. But instead, he's compliant to the youths directions, and virtually endowed with super-powers when the script calls for it. The acting, overall, is bad, as is the uninspired and implausible script. The near-rape scene of the little girl is too graphic and unnecessary--quite disturbing--but, too, quite rewarding ultimately. A heavy-handed film that adds little to the true plight of LA's homeless, mentally ill residents.  Did I mention how nothing rings true, and why is Martin Sheen in it, and why was it made? Just why?
/m/princess_of_the_row	0e0cb337-2bca-3c1f-aa31-776b3cd98628	4.5	Tayler Buck and Edi Gathegi have an amazing chemistry as a daughter and daddy, so much so, I was completely willing to overlook the flaw of predictability.  Hubby and wife both cried multiple times at a heartfelt story of veteran homelessness, mental health issues, and love.  An off the radar tough find, it's totally worth the 85 minutes.  Buck is a talent to watch after this teenage coming of age role.  Wife: 9/Hubby: 9.2 Average: 9.1/10
/m/princess_of_the_row	0e0cb337-2bca-3c1f-aa31-776b3cd98628	5	A must see for those who really don't understand "the system," and how it's suppose to help not only our children but the veterans of this country. Absolutely true to form!
/m/princess_of_the_row	0e0cb337-2bca-3c1f-aa31-776b3cd98628	5	I loved this movie! The bond Princess has with her dad pulled on every heart string I have.  It also sheds even more light on how horrible the system is for some veterans. These situations happen and it's so unacceptable for the US. Do better.
/m/princess_of_the_row	0e0cb337-2bca-3c1f-aa31-776b3cd98628	4.5	Yup. This movie is incredible. Brutal to watch. But important. Score is also exceptional.
/m/princess_of_the_row	0e0cb337-2bca-3c1f-aa31-776b3cd98628	5	This is a beautiful movie and we were all moved by it. Acting was superb and a great story of love and perseverance. Highly recommended.
/m/princess_of_the_row	0e0cb337-2bca-3c1f-aa31-776b3cd98628	5	Very deep. Heartwarming & heartbreaking all at the same time
/m/princess_of_the_row	0e0cb337-2bca-3c1f-aa31-776b3cd98628	4.5	With a great cast, a compelling story and a steady hand with the storytelling, "Princess of the Row" isn't technically a holiday movie but it has heart and redemption, which is what I look for this time of year. It's a wonderful movie just note that it's not for little kids.
/m/princess_of_the_row	0e0cb337-2bca-3c1f-aa31-776b3cd98628	5	One of the best movies of the year. Truly dynamic performance by Edi Gathegi and Tayler Buck is a rising star!
/m/princess_of_the_row	0e0cb337-2bca-3c1f-aa31-776b3cd98628	5	A timely and very touching story of a part of our civilization which is often ignored.

/m/collective_2020	606bb74c-498e-370e-acf8-85fb120e220f	4.5	I am not a Romanian national and I wasn't familiar at all with this tragedy, in my country we also struggle with corruption, I think it should get the classification of "pandemic" given the amount of people and countries all of the world that suffer with it, but some situations even for today's standards seem harder to believe compared to others.  An horrific accident that took place on a Romanian club, involving a fire that killed several people ended up exposing one of the worst cases of corruption of modern time in Romania, from adulterated and overpriced disinfectants, to doctors and hospital managers being bribed to keep their mouths shuts and burning victims with no so serious wounds being killed simply because of lack of conditions, it's as unbelievable as it seems.  Politics is indeed an element of this movie, and politics is always a sensitive and divisive topic - sure they discuss parties and which one was in power when this happened and part of the movie is viewed from the perspective of the Minister of Health that took over, but I believe we should take aside this while watching the film, because politics will always make people suspicious and thinking that the politicians simply wish to protect their own agenda (a lot of times might be true but on others not so much, it's an inglorious profession).  I think that what should be taken from this sad and tragic story is that we the people shouldn't simply sit and watch, we should question and rebel when the common good is compromised, and also not less important, we should praise what I call real journalism, these individuals risk their lives when they expose these dark truths, they take their profession to a whole other level and they have the courage to represent what real journalists look like, not those cheap imitations we see everyday on our sensationalists national channels, the ones doing the hard and dirty job that keeps us all away from the dark.
/m/collective_2020	606bb74c-498e-370e-acf8-85fb120e220f	4.5	An electrifying and groundbreaking documentary, Collective is a chilling reminder of the underhanded dealings of modern politics. Shot in a rigorously observational manner, Collective covers an event that took Eastern Europe by storm and led to massive big pharma and government reform.   On October 30, 2015, a deadly fire in Colectiv, a popular nightclub in Bucharest, Romania killed 64 and injured 146. Of the 64 killed, 38 died in the hospitals. Upon closer inspection, it was discovered they were in close contact with some of the most resistant hospital bacteria on the continent, which festered in their uncleansed wounds. In the first part of the film, Catalin Tolontan's journalistic crusade is detailed, as he embarks upon a journey to uncover the negligence, corruption and political machinations that plagues the Romanian health system as a whole. Vlad Voiculescu is introduced as the new minister of health, and he looks to take Romania in a new direction for health and safety but faces massive backlash. Watch Collective to find out how this crisis is solved.  A widely-known Romanian journalist at the Gazeta Sporturilor, Catalin Tolontan, together with Vlad Vioculescu, ex-minister of health and patients rights activist, are featured in Collective. Tolontan colleagues Mirela Neag and Razvan Lutac are captured in the newsroom, printing papers and delivering fiery questions at press conferences. I especially enjoyed their portion of the film, possibly due to my interest in journalism, but also because of Tolontan's unique approach to tackling this case - calculated vehemence. Even Voiculescu's segment is intriguing, albeit a little more morose and harder to follow. Honestly, you can't help but feel bad for Voiculescu, the one upstanding politician who cares for people more than for the money in his pocket, especially in the tense election scenes. Tedy Ursuleanu, a burn victim, is also featured in this film. Her story is not illustrated in great detail, but featuring her is, to me, a massively positive step for Nanau to take. It adds a whole new level of ‘wow, this is real' to Collective.  The cinematography in this film is absolutely stunning; the camera team uses dimly lit, low contrast scenes to drive home the intensity of the incident and harshly lit closeups in telling the story of the people that Collective follows. The lack of ambient noise filtration in press conferences helps the viewer really jump into the story. Besides the plot, this has got to be my favorite part of the entire documentary.  Collective promotes freedom of speech, government transparency, and valuing lives over profit, which are all positive morals. There are political elements in this film as well as rather graphic scenes depicting burn victims, that you should be aware of. Also, there is some bad language and the whole plot is unsuitable for younger audiences. Nanau successfully calls viewers to action to speak out against corruption.  I give Collective 4.5 stars out of 5 and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults. Collective is in theaters and on-demand November 20, 2020.
/m/collective_2020	606bb74c-498e-370e-acf8-85fb120e220f	4	A relevant issue how system polices the system itself, prevailing mutually assured corruption. Displaying almost inhuman levels of faceless cynicism, with no actual political grandstanding or "experts" talking directly into camera. This of course, doesn't prevent a certain part of the world to immediately project, long hauled corruption in the Eastern Europe onto their own dissatisfaction with their government, pretending it's the same thing because "if it can't be about me, it might as well doesn't exist". Good job America. What should be immensely admired is director's transparent insight into both news room and ministry cabinet, especially, when you consider the clash of interest this would cause, since it all was happening simultaneously.
/m/collective_2020	606bb74c-498e-370e-acf8-85fb120e220f	4	This documentary focuses mostly on a corruption scandal involving disinfectants sold to hospitals by a Romanian chemical company in the wake of a deadly club fire that led to protests and the fall of a government. It is very fly-on-the-wall without much background beyond the minimum but it is quite riveting and very interesting.
/m/collective_2020	606bb74c-498e-370e-acf8-85fb120e220f	5	Heartbreaking and insightful
/m/collective_2020	606bb74c-498e-370e-acf8-85fb120e220f	4.5	Compelling investigation of corruption following a tragic fire in Romania but could easily have taken place in many countries including the Untied States.  Remember that journalists have uncovered many governmental and corporate crimes against us, we the people.  I have always enjoyed this theme from All the King's Men to Spotlight.
/m/collective_2020	606bb74c-498e-370e-acf8-85fb120e220f	4	Collective shows how a government can prioritize money over the safety and health of its people and makes for an engaging, depressing, and memorable watch.
/m/collective_2020	606bb74c-498e-370e-acf8-85fb120e220f	5	Stunning expose of government when corrupted. Brilliant in every respect.
/m/collective_2020	606bb74c-498e-370e-acf8-85fb120e220f	5	So proud of my country for this. The first romanian production to get nominated for the Oscars. I think it's well deserved, what happened back in 2015 in that club was terrible, but the worst part is after that, because our country and our government is corrupt to the core and people from the rest of the world should acknowledge the fact that Romania is a good country but it was ruined by it's weak and greedy politicians and their selfishness.
/m/collective_2020	606bb74c-498e-370e-acf8-85fb120e220f	5	An incredibly important film! Shows just how far and how damaging corruption reaches into everyday lives.
/m/the_giant_2019	5e359288-38a8-3bc8-9972-85cef0a106f8	5	Madelyn Cline shines as usual
/m/the_giant_2019	5e359288-38a8-3bc8-9972-85cef0a106f8	1.5	God I want to give this one star, but it actually has good enough actors doing an adequate job of acting that it almost kept me intrigued.  BUT ALAS, the mom dying is never explained. The Giant is never explained, and the murders are never explained. IF this was part of a series it left too many questions that by the end of the movie no one will care about, but just be glad the agony is finally over. Well written scripts can be ruined by a director trying to be M night shamalam!
/m/the_giant_2019	5e359288-38a8-3bc8-9972-85cef0a106f8	4	Probably the most overlooked and underrated movie of 2020. It's such a gorgeous movie to look at, it's so beautifully shot. It's very spine tingling and gets under your skin for how real it feels. Not a movie for everyone because general audiences today need straight forward and easy to understand plots. It's a movie that deserves to be talked about more and analyzed more. Definitely shouldn't be forgotten about like it never existed because it seems like it's heading in that direction and I won't let it.
/m/the_giant_2019	5e359288-38a8-3bc8-9972-85cef0a106f8	0.5	The perfect movie to nap to!
/m/the_giant_2019	5e359288-38a8-3bc8-9972-85cef0a106f8	0.5	As if the low-contrast, low-meaning motivational Instagram posts of the millennial generation became an indie movie that is awkwardly convinced of being "deep".
/m/the_giant_2019	5e359288-38a8-3bc8-9972-85cef0a106f8	0.5	T hat shit, the fuck? Like actually, what was that. It looked cool at the beginning but then the whole last 40 minutes was so bland and confusing and it sounded like all the dialogue was the same. I don't even know who the villain is other than the director/writer. ‬Like, was it supposed to be an allegory about the struggles of PTSD? But even then I feel like I'm just trying to find SOMETHING in what should've stayed a short film.
/m/iron_mask_2020	80dce754-3cb5-381c-b4df-33ed6267c997	1	Not sure why Jackie and Arnold agreed to do this movie.    This movie is really bad.  Russian and Chinese produced.  There are concepts and sections of this movie that were done really well, IMHO, but overall, very poorly executed.  Arnold and Jackie Chan's acting was very poor compared to other movies.  Seems to me that they were on a tight budget and tight schedule (not many scene takes).
/m/iron_mask_2020	80dce754-3cb5-381c-b4df-33ed6267c997	0.5	One of the worst movies i have seen in my life. Though it stars Chan and Arnold they are literally in the film for 20 seconds. The acting is really bad and cringe. The sets looked fake. The lip syncing was done by a 12 year old and the overall film is the embodiment of cringe. Don't watch this. Also why the fuck is it 2 hours long?
/m/iron_mask_2020	80dce754-3cb5-381c-b4df-33ed6267c997	4	Truely enjoyed this movie! I took off a star for the dubbing. Watching the lips move in a different language was distracting. Couldve been done better. I know the story was corney but i was very entertained.
/m/iron_mask_2020	80dce754-3cb5-381c-b4df-33ed6267c997	2.5	I want to rate it higher, but just can't because of a few things. First, the sound is absolutely atrocious and should never have been allowed.  Second, this should have been separated into at least two movies at minimum. Too much content for one movie. Third, Arnold didn't get to see the dragon, wtf?!? Poor Arnie. Love Jackie and Arnie!!!
/m/iron_mask_2020	80dce754-3cb5-381c-b4df-33ed6267c997	5	Great movie, action packed with lots of good fight scenes.    Some commented that this is a Sunday afternoon kid movie and- this is far from the truth. The movie is far to violent for children or kids.  I would say age 14 and up would be satisfactory in my opinion. I highly recommend.
/m/iron_mask_2020	80dce754-3cb5-381c-b4df-33ed6267c997	2.5	The campiness seems almost intentional as if the filmmakers were trying to make this martial arts fantasy extremely unserious and goofy. The film is still enjoyable due to it's rapid pacing and shamelessly bloated runtime.
/m/iron_mask_2020	80dce754-3cb5-381c-b4df-33ed6267c997	1	Could have used more Nichols cage
/m/iron_mask_2020	80dce754-3cb5-381c-b4df-33ed6267c997	0.5	Worst film I've ever seen with Jackie chan and arny. Poor acting, all fights cgi, lots of green light from greenscreen overspills. Poor story. Lost track. Just bared 90 mins and turned it off.   Sorry to give the lowest score but it was unbearable
/m/iron_mask_2020	80dce754-3cb5-381c-b4df-33ed6267c997	1	This could have been a decent movie if not for the awful dubbing, which was not even done well since it doesn't match up with the video.
/m/iron_mask_2020	80dce754-3cb5-381c-b4df-33ed6267c997	0.5	It's just a second part from a previ I us movie called Viy back in 2014. It's long and tedious which is unfortunate since there is some great actors but honestly this show would be better with its own story outside of the Viy trilogy.
/m/18_to_party	b453eddb-0f5a-32f3-a685-3caa610c9e0b	3.5	This had a very authentic feel to it that captures the time period it portrays . Honestly I much simpler and better time ☹️ 3.5. Not much actually goes on but it never really gets dull
/m/18_to_party	b453eddb-0f5a-32f3-a685-3caa610c9e0b	4	18 to Party is nothing more than a character movie. Without them you'd have no movie. So, thankfully all of them were developed well enough. I didn't like the abrupt ending was, but I do think it was a good closure to the film. If there was more, that'd be cool, but there isn't. Overall, a fun flick.
/m/the_nest_2020	97ea20f3-a317-49ac-8f7e-8c20a6775445	5	It surprised me to see the low audience score on this. It's a beautifully constructed movie. Durkin delivers without cause for concern as to whether or not he is pandering to the modern audience's lack of focus. It's a powerful story told within the confines of a world that dominated the 1980's hippie era. Law and Coon are a force on screen. Of note is the way Carrie delivers her facial expressions conveying a simmering pain under her sophisticated exterior. The association to symbolic gestures in the movie concerning the horse and the house are all wonderful choices. The director has been fearless in his decisions to produce a slow burn, simmering piece of cinema which is sure to be heralded as a masterpiece once it has reached enough considered movie goers eyeballs.
/m/the_nest_2020	97ea20f3-a317-49ac-8f7e-8c20a6775445	2.5	An ordinary movie about an ordinary family that moves to the UK from the USA and continue having money problems, going to work, going to school, going to parties, arguing, and eating meals together... and that's about it.  It's like 90 minutes of a really good start to something and then it just ends.
/m/the_nest_2020	97ea20f3-a317-49ac-8f7e-8c20a6775445	0.5	Please do not waste nearly two hours of your life with this less than mediocre drivel. There is no plot, there is no story. It's utter rubbish. How Mr Law can associate himself with this dire tirade
/m/the_nest_2020	97ea20f3-a317-49ac-8f7e-8c20a6775445	0.5	What a horrid, pointless, boring movie. Billed as a thriller, there is no tension in the film and no threat to cause tension - really. There's no stalker, no murderer, no blackmailer, no mystery. There's nothing to cause tension. It's basically about a dishonest person and the family he moves from the States to the UK chasing big business deals that never materialize. The kids hate their new school, the wife hates their new home and the husband acts like he's wealthy when he's actually broke. That's the story....no point and no ending. I mean, the ending literally is (spoiler alert?) them sitting down to eat breakfast. That's the end. A horrible waste of time.
/m/the_nest_2020	97ea20f3-a317-49ac-8f7e-8c20a6775445	1	Slow, tense, painful
/m/the_nest_2020	97ea20f3-a317-49ac-8f7e-8c20a6775445	0.5	Absolute meandering drivel. shallow story line with nothing to hold the viewers interest
/m/the_nest_2020	97ea20f3-a317-49ac-8f7e-8c20a6775445	3	If the trailer prepared me for yet another indie drama dissecting a marital breakdown that I've seen numerous times before (thanks, Noah Baumbach!), the subtle, economical and precise manner writer-director Sean Durbin opens his film and lays out the relationships and tensions within the O'Hara family certainly piqued my interests and almost made me look forward to the rest of the film. Jude Law and Carrie Coon plays the central couple, one Brit, one American, negotiating life in American suburbia before Law's ambitious and restless Rory upends everyone's lives by moving the family to England. However, as the indie drama charts the different challenges arising from this relocation, the plotting begins to feel familiar, if not predictable, as events slowly deepen their feeling of isolation and despair that we already sensed they're facing. Durkin's grounded screenplay thankfully resisted melodramatic cliches, which were set up but never come to fruition, though I did find the step-daughter's arc inconsistently and less organically written than the others. Atmospherically constructed with an underlying sense of dread and dreariness, the film hints, momentarily, of a genre surprise or at least a narrative detour, but they are quickly and abruptly abandoned, like when a tinge of horror and the supernatural creep in when Coon's wife Allison finds a locked door suddenly left ajar in the old mansion house she's practically imprisoned in (or is it a metaphor? Because this film loves a metaphor); or a brief interlude introducing Anne Reid as Rory's mother that feels like we've switched over to a Mike Leigh film that I wouldn't mind staying longer for. While Durkin clearly demonstrates his skills as a director and Law and Coon give nuanced and affecting performances, it's also drenched in indie drama tropes that I find somewhat hard to get particularly excited about.
/m/the_nest_2020	97ea20f3-a317-49ac-8f7e-8c20a6775445	0.5	I went to see it with two friends, each of us kept from looking at the other, waiting for something to actually happen, or make sense. When the film ended for no clear reason with a blank screen, we burst out laughing at the stupidity and uselessness of this awful film
/m/the_nest_2020	97ea20f3-a317-49ac-8f7e-8c20a6775445	5	Loved the movie.  Great acting and interesting storyline, with lots of suspense.  Would have loved to see their next move.
/m/the_nest_2020	97ea20f3-a317-49ac-8f7e-8c20a6775445	2	Ultimately negative and totally disappointing.
/m/beast_mode	30013b77-4917-3ed5-8e4a-c572f5469de3	5	It was a great movie that kept my attention throughout the whole film. Great cameos! Kind of reminded me of "Weekend at Bernie's" but surrounded by characters in the film industry.
/m/train_to_busan_presents_peninsula	1e7535c9-0c40-42dc-a913-86808da9ec66	3	Ironically, this is no "Train to Busan". Sure, it is set in the same zombie universe as that movie and it helmed by the same filmmakers but it is almost an entirely different walk in the park; or in this case a "drift" in the streets (bad "nudge, wink" joke, sorry). But all things considered, this is a watchable fun flick on its own. It moves at a good pace with some effectively propulsive score that produces much of the intensity on-screen. The action is fast and generally well-made. But this very much feels so Hollywoodized, never reaching the fresh heights of its predecessor. This is an action-packed zombie romp crossed with "Fast & Furious" and "Mad Max." It sounds like a wacky thrill-ride to indulge in as a guilty pleasure but aside from the "Tokyo Drifitng" scenes and a prolonged chase sequence near the climax that feels obviously inspired by "Fury Road", the set-pieces are otherwise routine. Even those aforementioned "inspired" sequences are so reliant on CG that it can look too weightless and dodgy. Slick and energetic through-out with some cool zombie stunts but lacking any grit or emotional weight to the proceedings. The cast does fine but the characters are either flat or over the top. All the emotional beats are overwrought and unearned. There is this whole tearjerker sequence at the end was so drawn-out and obnoxious that it annoyed me more than it moved me. If you are in a very fine mood and haven't seen the previous movie, as well as any "Fast & Furious" or "Mad Max" movie, this movie will be great to pass the time. As for the "Train to Busan" Fans? Just adjust your expectations accordingly. - 6/10 (C+)
/m/train_to_busan_presents_peninsula	1e7535c9-0c40-42dc-a913-86808da9ec66	5	I think, as zombie fan, that this is "Absolute Must See".  I think his only rival is first Resident Evil, but since i dont like mutants and superpowers...this one is the best for me. Good actors, very nice plot. Interesting place and ideas.  I really like it. For me for now top 1 zombie movie.
/m/train_to_busan_presents_peninsula	1e7535c9-0c40-42dc-a913-86808da9ec66	3	Right off the bat, you need to be warned: nobody from Train To Busan is in this movie! It's set in the same universe, just not the same people. This does kind of feel like a Fast and the Furious: Zombie edition though. (foreverfinalgirl.com/train-to-busan-peninsula/)
/m/train_to_busan_presents_peninsula	1e7535c9-0c40-42dc-a913-86808da9ec66	1.5	Truly a missed opportunity to build upon an amazing first entry. Cheap emotional tactics, felt unconnected to any of the cast. Zombie threat is only relevant when the plot needs it to be.  Korean cinema is worse off for following a lazy Hollywood formula. Fortunately there's a plethora of Korean hits in the genre, give this one a pass.
/m/train_to_busan_presents_peninsula	1e7535c9-0c40-42dc-a913-86808da9ec66	3.5	A zombie outbreak occurs in South Korea, where the government is overwhelmed in a day. Korea Marine Captain Jung-seok drives his family members to a ship. On the way, he encounters a couple with a young daughter, but he ignores their pleas for help as the man is bleeding. Jung-seok's family board a ship where an infected man turns into a zombie and infects several people in a cabin, including Jung-seok's nephew Dong-hwan. Jung-seok's sister refuses to leave Dong-hwan, so Jung-seok closes off the cabin while zombies bite her. Jung-seok stops his brother-in-law Chul-min from entering as armed soldiers arrive. Other nations contain the outbreak by quarantining South Korea. Four years later in Hong Kong, a guilt-ridden Jung-seok and Chul-min are recruited by Chinese mobsters for a mission with two other Koreans to return to South Korea and retrieve a truck containing US$20 million; if successful, they will supposedly receive half of the money. The team arrives at the peninsula at night by boat and finds the truck. The team fends off and kills the zombie truck driver, making noises that attract more zombies. Jung-seok shoots several, and the team escapes. On the way back to Incheon Port, the team is ambushed by a rogue militia, Unit 631, which uses light to attract more zombies, leading to the team crashing their vehicles. Jung-seok is thrown out of the truck while Chul-min hides in it. The other members of the team are killed, one due to the crash, and one by Unit 631 leader Sergeant Hwang. Jung-seok is rescued by two sisters in a car: Joon, a skilled driver who is adept at manipulating and killing zombies, and young Yu-jin. They return to their hideout, joining their grandfather Elder Kim and mother Min-jung. Jung-Seok realizes Min-jung and Yu-jin were part of the family he refused to help four years ago...  Rotten Tomatoes critics consensus reads: "Although a disappointing sense of familiarity threatens to derail Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula, fans of the original may find it a thrilling enough ride." Editor-in-Chief of Film Companion, wrote, "Despite some inspired sequences, Peninsula never hits the emotional high notes and claustrophobic tension of Train To Busan."  This zombie apocalypse is a standalone sequel to the 2016 film "Train to Busan" and carries some sort of nods to "Army of The Dead" and "Escape From New York" to my mind. It´s an intense and bloody story, but with some interesting characters like Lee Re´s Joon and solid acting at times. But, the CGI is a bit too evident/over the top at times, the action is too choreographed and with this being an Asian film that sort of theatrical vibe looms all over the production which I tend to have issues with.
/m/train_to_busan_presents_peninsula	1e7535c9-0c40-42dc-a913-86808da9ec66	3.5	Decent action sequences, but the human side of the story is toned down, thus the film suffers as a result
/m/train_to_busan_presents_peninsula	1e7535c9-0c40-42dc-a913-86808da9ec66	3	A bit disappointed with this movie. I had high expectations for this sequel and it just didn’t capture the thrill and suspense in the way the first one did
/m/train_to_busan_presents_peninsula	1e7535c9-0c40-42dc-a913-86808da9ec66	3	It felt like Fast and Furious met the zombie apocalypse.  I liked the movie, but it didn't capture the suspense and thrill of being chased, as well as the emotions as within Train To Busan.
/m/train_to_busan_presents_peninsula	1e7535c9-0c40-42dc-a913-86808da9ec66	2.5	This sequel didn't come close to the entertainment and freshness of the original Train to Busan.

/m/the_donut_king	73a2a906-e4e8-4662-8227-58eca5448ab9	5	3 Stories are told in this documentary: - How Cambodian refugees escaped war and genocide and came to the US - Ted's (the donut king) personal story.  - How the donut business evolved over the decades and children of Cambodian immigrants are taking over their parents' businesses.  The first 2 are absolutely incredible.
/m/the_donut_king	73a2a906-e4e8-4662-8227-58eca5448ab9	4	yes! I knew more than most about this particular, awesome Los Angeles situation but it was great to hear from so many stake holders -- and the longer story of Ted Ngoy himself is... so intense.
/m/the_donut_king	73a2a906-e4e8-4662-8227-58eca5448ab9	5	Inspirational. Good lessons to learn from both the successes and failures
/m/the_donut_king	73a2a906-e4e8-4662-8227-58eca5448ab9	4.5	'The Donut King' is a wonderfully-told documentary film which tells the life story of California donut shop owner, Ted Ngoy.  It's fascinating on multiple levels. Ngoy helped so many Cambodians set up a life by franchises his donut stores.  The reverence the talking heads have for Ted is incredible.  Many different storylines are covered, but none more stood out than the good ole American Dream.  Final Score: 9/10
/m/the_donut_king	73a2a906-e4e8-4662-8227-58eca5448ab9	5	Great story, great storytelling. Rollercoaster of a ride. Enjoy!
/m/the_donut_king	73a2a906-e4e8-4662-8227-58eca5448ab9	3.5	Educational!  Those donuts are good!
/m/stardust_2020	e91d0803-34bd-399e-8ab7-668dac7ac0ad	1	I couldn't find anything to like about this movie. Johnny Flynn, though I like him in other things, is nothing like David Bowie. Nothing about this movie seemed true to life. It was pretty boring, and painful watching David Bowie be turned into this sad sack, entitled, jerk guy with an identity crisis and no communication skills.   The lack of music speaks for itself. Skip this one.
/m/stardust_2020	e91d0803-34bd-399e-8ab7-668dac7ac0ad	0.5	Horrible movie, don't waste your time watching it!!!
/m/stardust_2020	e91d0803-34bd-399e-8ab7-668dac7ac0ad	0.5	This is a complete turd. How do you make a David Bowie movie without any of David Bowie's songs? My wife and I watched "Class Action Park" shortly after this and I joked, "I'll bet this movie has more Bowie songs than Stardust!" Wouldn't you know... closing credits of "Class Action Park," they play All The Madmen (by David Bowie). I was rolling on the floor laughing.  It looks like it was shot by a 2nd year cinematography student. Every other scene is a pensive Bowie gazing out of the window of a moving car. I'm sure 20 mins of the movie is this repeated over and over (and over).  I'm not saying you should give this a hard pass because it's one of the finest hate-watch movies ever. Don't expect anything and you will still be disappointed. But shout out to Marc Maron who seemed to be the only good thing about this movie.
/m/stardust_2020	e91d0803-34bd-399e-8ab7-668dac7ac0ad	0.5	Full of inaccuracies and piss poor screen writing and editing, this truly does a disservice to David Bowie as he didn't want a movie made about him for years, and also a sin for the great actors such as Mike Moran.
/m/stardust_2020	e91d0803-34bd-399e-8ab7-668dac7ac0ad	1	Stardust is the most lifeless attempt at capturing the early years of one of the greatest musicians ever! Although Johnny Flynn is alright as David Bowie, almost every other aspect takes away from his performance. Considering they didn't get permission from his family, this is a disgrace of a biopic and something you should stay far away from!
/m/stardust_2020	e91d0803-34bd-399e-8ab7-668dac7ac0ad	0.5	This movie covers a span of time in Bowie's career where he recorded:  'The Man Who Sold the World,' 'Changes,' 'Life on Mars?,' 'Queen Bitch,' 'Starman,' 'Ziggy Stardust,' 'Suffragette City,' 'Jean Genie,' & 'Moonage Daydream' to name a few.  And you won't hear any of those songs once.  Whatever you may think of 'Rocketman' or 'Bohemia Rhapsody' those filmmakers, at least, knew people expected to hear music.  This film will go down in history as one of the least musical biopics of one of the most musically influential subjects ever.  It's utterly mad.  Then there's the specter of schizophrenia which is a predominant theme in Bowie's music but is only explored in fragments in the movie.  At the end of the movie you see he's undergone this complete metamorphosis and you witness not one iota of his becoming Ziggy or anything akin to what we think of as Bowie.    Johnny Flynn's portrayal is just simply nothing like Bowie at all.  Especially, as Bowie on stage.  He can't walk nor talk nor sing nor even wear clothes like Bowie.  He has not a clue as how to portray Bowie's theatrical aesthetic.    The whole thing is just bloody terrible.
/m/stardust_2020	e91d0803-34bd-399e-8ab7-668dac7ac0ad	0.5	This movie is a shame. Stardust has failed from the beginning and it's a mess .I just can't understand how is this possible to let someone making  a biopic about David Bowie without his own music and relevant stories of his life.I found that this movie tried to simplify the genius behind the complex of Ziggy Stardust's creation.At multiple times,the film suffered of a lack creativity and budgeting.It feels like they did a terrible fan footage.I had good hopes for appreciate it,but I just can't be satisfied by the results.For me,Stardust is really inappropriate and should be better than that.
/m/stardust_2020	e91d0803-34bd-399e-8ab7-668dac7ac0ad	2	2 stars, 1 for costumes, 1 for set design. Congrats on those- too bad the rest of the movie was lacking character or interest. Props to Marc Maron for playing himself....again.
/m/stardust_2020	e91d0803-34bd-399e-8ab7-668dac7ac0ad	1	I tried I really did. Poor Marc. He was great. He was the only thing keeping me interested. This movie had no budget kinda like the storyline. I kept seeing the same exact cars in different places. The music chosen to open scenes was unnerving. What moron would keep essential paperwork scattered about in a car?   The main lead who played Bowie should have researched his role/character better if at all. He's one of those over reactive actors. Horrendous in every way. I haven't seen a movie this bad since Ishtar! I should've checked with my Bowie friends before I wasted my time. This is a warning. Don't waste your precious time.
/m/stardust_2020	e91d0803-34bd-399e-8ab7-668dac7ac0ad	4	Great movie! Maybe someday, it'll be more respected.
/m/crazy_not_insane	00a5b735-ce2c-3393-8a9f-7d80c0e82724	3.5	It is a documentary about Dr. Dorothy Lewis's work on the psychology of killing. However, the work mostly focuses on her study on serial killers and DID, the question of what motivates us to kill is not properly investigated as the doc rather chooses to focus on the cases with a history of abuse. I am not an authority about the matter, hovewer, I find it insufficient that only counter perspective to that of Lewis is an former goverment worker who had been portrayed one-sided.
/m/crazy_not_insane	00a5b735-ce2c-3393-8a9f-7d80c0e82724	5	Daring, schoking and mostly fascinating, this documentary is a inmersive exploration of human brain, and its behaviour in a world full of abuse, violence and trauma.
/m/crazy_not_insane	00a5b735-ce2c-3393-8a9f-7d80c0e82724	1.5	Like the subjects who committed these crimes, this film is a muddled and messy piece of work. It ultimately has me questioning whether psychology (or ‘psychiatry' to be generous) is actually a science. Inner psychic states are still outside direct observation, no matter how many MRIs we might present, and interviews, like the position or speed of electrons under Heisenberg's gaze, can be highly subjective. I do say this mostly tongue in cheek though I have an old friend in the humanities at Yale who once seriously suggested psychology is not a scientific endeavor. Certainly psychiatry is a science at least, but the explication of scientific ‘truth' here leaves much to the imagination. The film itself begins with Nazis and ends with witch hunts. This is highbrow ressentiment on full display. Ever since Charles Manson hit the scene, intellectuals can't get enough of conflating victims and murderers. My position on this is that the question was decided by Primo Levi - the victims of murderers, no matter how many hypothetical ‘what if' mind games one cares to play, are not the same as the murderers themselves. Dorothy Otnow Lewis is a psychiatrist but by the end of the film admits she identifies with the witches burned at the stake both in old movies and reality. The filmmakers are stretching here to cast Lewis as some kind of visionary heretic but the truth of this film appears to be that she is mostly (even if not entirely) a hired gun for anti-death penalty litigators. This is a bit unfair and even cynical of me perhaps, yes. Still I find it fascinating that legal crusaders can, on the one hand, find that police (through suggestive interview techniques) will elicit false confessions, but yet can also present these "scientific" interview techniques of Lewis as valid and unimpeachable. Indeed while interviewing a professional executioner in his trailer park home, the presentation of elite class hopes for a better world juxtaposed with working class reality could not be more harsh yet even more invisible. Lewis is quite ready to judge people if it fits her theory. When the mother of Ted Bundy remarks that she can't wait for this whole thing to be over, this is seen as evidence of Bundy's abusive childhood. The possibility that this is a candid and very human response to tragedy is not considered by Lewis or the filmmakers, who offer only a judgmental ‘tut tut' from Lewis. The documentary does offer moments of counter-perspective but always framed as establishment types who are pro-death penalty. Ultimately, this film doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it about serial killers? Not really. Is it a scientific exploration of what makes people kill? Sort of. Is it a character study of Dorothy Otnow Lewis? To a degree. The only thing I can say with certainty is that the film advocates against the death penalty, yet even here, the film cannot escape its own contradictions. While suggesting that the death penalty is a ‘return to the dark ages', it begins by pointing out that in those same dark ages the mentally ill were not executed because madness was deemed punishment enough. Like dueling experts in a jury trial, I would suggest that viewers will take what they want from this haphazard and clumsy piece of work. If you are opposed to the death penalty already, there is nothing to change your mind in this movie. If you already have HBO, I'm sure this will be a deep and meaningful exploration of our unjust society in action. Personally I want my money back. I found it on the whole an unconvincing and mundane exploration of the anti-death penalty movement through the lens of one psychiatrist's rather scattered and unfocused body of work. Was Ted Bundy the product of incest? No, but Lewis is disappointed about that. How does this relate to her other work with brain damaged killers? She admits Bundy did not have severe brain damage. Certainly the suggestion that Bundy was dissociative is interesting. Are people born evil? Perhaps not. Is the legal system perfect? Of course not. Is that reason enough to ban the death penalty? I don't necessarily think so. Do psychiatrists make mistakes? Apparently so. Is David Cross at all connected with this movie? Aside from my guess that he is opposed to the death penalty, no. Are we entering the new dark age? Wait and see.
/m/crazy_not_insane	00a5b735-ce2c-3393-8a9f-7d80c0e82724	5	This was an eye-opening documentary, well put together, cogent and fascinating, on how serial killers come about. Dr. Dorothy Otnow Lewis was a knowledgeable and empathic descriptor, showing audio and/or footage of interviews with serial killers along with more of the story. It was a completely unforgettable take on the forensics of the underlying foundation of the serial killer personality and process.
/m/crazy_not_insane	00a5b735-ce2c-3393-8a9f-7d80c0e82724	3.5	intriguing and educational
/m/crazy_not_insane	00a5b735-ce2c-3393-8a9f-7d80c0e82724	2	One of the poorer-made documentaries, lacking in detail and actual case evidence. Instead the the entire film was led by narration from Dr Lewis, who I didn't find very convincing in her case assessments or psych explanations.
/m/crazy_not_insane	00a5b735-ce2c-3393-8a9f-7d80c0e82724	5	Regardless of whether you agree with Dorothy's assertions or the topic as a whole, it is an extremely interesting documentary and definitely worth watching.
/m/crazy_not_insane	00a5b735-ce2c-3393-8a9f-7d80c0e82724	5	SUPER interesting look into the minds of serial killers
/m/crazy_not_insane	00a5b735-ce2c-3393-8a9f-7d80c0e82724	4	Fascinating profile. You may change your mind on how the criminal mind works.
/m/crazy_not_insane	00a5b735-ce2c-3393-8a9f-7d80c0e82724	5	Very thought-provoking footage and audio of several serial killers that I found both extremely troubling yet undeniably valuable to understanding the WHY. There was hard work being done by Dr. Lewis, and I commend her for maintaining such honesty and integrity throughout her life & career. A real pioneer, as they said! Thank you for making this! Very well directed.
/m/run_2020	27ffe854-d519-322b-ad5b-5d310592e4b6	3	Kiera Allen gives a captivating performance in a film full of dread which reminded me of Misery for its use of tension but never quite reached the same heights.
/m/run_2020	27ffe854-d519-322b-ad5b-5d310592e4b6	4	While laying out a common narrative that doesn't always make sense, it also provides quality entertainment to feel every moment.
/m/run_2020	27ffe854-d519-322b-ad5b-5d310592e4b6	4.5	The ending OMG I loved it! Honestly from beginning to end it was really good. I do have one beef where she had an opportunity to escape but didnt was a bit disappointing and the second opportunity wasnt really her fault that was on the other guy for taking so long. I say worth the watch, give it a chance and you might like it too. SARAH PAULSON is always the best crazy lady and her character does exactly what you'd expect her to do. Sometimes I like to yell at the TV lol I only yelled once and for which I gave it the full 5 stars.
/m/run_2020	27ffe854-d519-322b-ad5b-5d310592e4b6	4	Run. (B+) Movie makes your skin crawl. Character development and the way the characters change from the beginning compared to the end was very well executed. From the beginning you can get a sense of where this movie may head and then it heads that way but I do feel it gives you a good amount of chills and twists along the way. The devastation put on display by the cast here made you get on to the edge of your seat and with a thriller that is always a good idea. There were some decisions that were made by characters where if the character used more common sense then the situation could have been handled much more effectively. Also as mentioned above, some major plot points seem fairly obvious throughout so that can take away from it being a mystery. Their are mysterious things that have satisfying reveals but I feel their was a missed opportunity to ha e more ambiguity in some of the plot points, especially earlier on.
/m/run_2020	27ffe854-d519-322b-ad5b-5d310592e4b6	3.5	Great thriller with many interesting twists.

/m/run_2020	27ffe854-d519-322b-ad5b-5d310592e4b6	5	Such an unexpected movie, very well done
/m/run_2020	27ffe854-d519-322b-ad5b-5d310592e4b6	5	This movie is really great. The story is really good and the actors where great.
/m/run_2020	27ffe854-d519-322b-ad5b-5d310592e4b6	4	I loved this thriller. I think mostly because of Sarah Paulson. She crushes every movie she’s in. I liked the plot as well
/m/run_2020	27ffe854-d519-322b-ad5b-5d310592e4b6	4	A psychological thriller in which a physically challenged teenager is forbidden from seeing the mail and is kept in isolation. She soon starts suspecting her mother of keeping dark secrets and decides to investigate. Dealing with topics such as the Munchausen syndrome by proxy and manipulation, it also acts as an allegory and indictment of modern parenting and when it becomes asphyxiating. Truly compelling and intense, it will keep the viewers at the edge of their seats.
/m/chick_fight	e8246488-5fc1-33a4-a460-aaaa90a05fd7	2	So stupid and terrible . But watchable 1.9

/m/chick_fight	e8246488-5fc1-33a4-a460-aaaa90a05fd7	1.5	Chick Fight (Streaming on Prime) A really great cast manages to make this merely very bad as opposed to abysmal.  Dulce Sloan and (former wrestler) Kevin Nash get most of the good lines.  I am always baffled by the number of people who watched Fight Club and entirely missed the point.   1 1/2 stars out of 5.
/m/chick_fight	e8246488-5fc1-33a4-a460-aaaa90a05fd7	1	It was not worth watching. I am shocked it even got made.
/m/chick_fight	e8246488-5fc1-33a4-a460-aaaa90a05fd7	2.5	Well, it didnt make any pretensions of being anything but a silly and fun comedy. Direct, a bit heavy handed but Fun.  So in that sense it was OK.
/m/chick_fight	e8246488-5fc1-33a4-a460-aaaa90a05fd7	0.5	Oof, that was rotten- literally sums it up. The lack of talent of these overpriced exaggerated people (that they call 'actors') is flabbergasting. They are only good for lecturing us common folks on how we damage the environment and how our thinking is bad and unprogressive. They should stick to that and let real actors do movies.
/m/echo_boomers	8bd2e3d3-6a88-364a-bc3b-07e04e3489c2	3	Echo Boomers is a film with no true centre to hold onto. It shapes up as an exciting film but never truly goes anywhere. It follows 5 college graduates who are frustrated at their lack of opportunity in the world. They come to be employed by an older thief who uses them to break into the homes of very wealthy people and steal their valuables, predominantly art. For them they see it as not only a money making exercise but also a reaction to the world they can't find a place in. The trouble with the film is that the main characters are not very likeable so it's near impossible to feel invsted in their journey. So even as things go pear shaped I really couldn't care for thier predicament. The great Michael Shannon is fun to watch as usual but this film just doesn't reach its potential.
/m/echo_boomers	8bd2e3d3-6a88-364a-bc3b-07e04e3489c2	0.5	This film is based on an ideal of what it looks an exciting film should be. There is an attempt to make this happen. A failed attempt. This film is rotten. Acting is below bad.
/m/echo_boomers	8bd2e3d3-6a88-364a-bc3b-07e04e3489c2	0.5	I always check the reviews/ratings first. I have learned I usually agree with the critics. I never agree with the audience score. This movie is a prime example. I’m assuming Michael Shannon is a part of this movie because he liked the concept. But never saw the final product.
/m/echo_boomers	8bd2e3d3-6a88-364a-bc3b-07e04e3489c2	5	I thought the movie was really good and I think Patrick Schwarzenegger did an awesome job in the lead role.  I would watch it again in a heartbeat.
/m/echo_boomers	8bd2e3d3-6a88-364a-bc3b-07e04e3489c2	3.5	Echo Boomers is an entertaining film. Michael Shannon and Patrick Schwarzenegger are the stars of the film. The other acting is decent but not as good. The story is decent and has some great parts to it with some meh bits.
/m/echo_boomers	8bd2e3d3-6a88-364a-bc3b-07e04e3489c2	3.5	Had not much expectations going through this one but turns out it is particularly recomendable. Heist movie with an anarchy message for the new futureless generation, this one couldn't find more echo in the actual context. The script is basically effective and it's always good to get that great interpretation from Michael Shannon. Enjoyable.
/m/echo_boomers	8bd2e3d3-6a88-364a-bc3b-07e04e3489c2	5	Michael Shannon is always awesome, but the direction, cinematography and script all shine here as well. Our family of four all liked it, and we never agree.
/m/echo_boomers	8bd2e3d3-6a88-364a-bc3b-07e04e3489c2	1.5	Poorly written and haphazardly directed dreck.  Patrick Schwarzenegger and Michael Shannon are passable but the other actors are awful.  Slowly paced and boring, its 94 minutes seemed like 940.  Avoid.
/m/echo_boomers	8bd2e3d3-6a88-364a-bc3b-07e04e3489c2	2	2 out of 5 stars. Echo Boomers tries to be a heist thriller. About a young college grad who has difficulty trying to get a job. Instead joins his group of friends who break into high class peoples home to steal there valuables and vandalized the property. Plot tries to focus on the generation group of people. Which they feel like they are cheated in our society. So they try to get back at it by robbing peoples stuff. Dumb plot. The direction is predictable. The performances are tedious. And the film is quite forgettable.
/m/echo_boomers	8bd2e3d3-6a88-364a-bc3b-07e04e3489c2	3	A movie with 2 inaccurate ratings. 36% Tomato Meter is too low but 96% is way to generous. Average the 2 ratings together is probably about right for this movie.
/m/embattled	855e6215-dce5-3dfb-9a72-322688e788d0	2	Starts out with a lot of stereotypes and cliches and, while it does keep those up throughout, the story it tells is somewhat original but not one I'm all that interested in.  I mean... the central character is not someone anyone should want to see win and the outcome of the fight does not matter since he gets the big spotlight and payday anyways.  Still, as juvenile as the premise was, it did make me a little bit curious to see how it ends.  At least it doesn't glorify MMA as the ‘end all, be all' to life, the universe, and everything in between like every other movie on the subject.
/m/embattled	855e6215-dce5-3dfb-9a72-322688e788d0	5	Great flick seen it twice now, and it's just as good the second time. Way above that 70% fresh rating
/m/embattled	855e6215-dce5-3dfb-9a72-322688e788d0	3.5	Didn't expect much of this movie, fights are almost realistic (kinda fell that punches are not real). Story is pretty classic. Final fight was intense, especially the end.
/m/embattled	855e6215-dce5-3dfb-9a72-322688e788d0	5	I thought it was a really good movie and it showed that Stephen Dorffs character wasn't the horrible abusive father to Jett always. He played a very believable bad guy. I really liked the ending showing what was important.
/m/embattled	855e6215-dce5-3dfb-9a72-322688e788d0	3.5	That was a really good movie.
/m/embattled	855e6215-dce5-3dfb-9a72-322688e788d0	1.5	So I see this interview with Stephen Dorff and he says Scarlet Johannsen should be embarrassed to star in Black Widow, as if he's some sort of upper crust arthouse film regular.  Look, I'm no Marvel Fanboy, but Dorff has no business being critical of anybody after making this pile of steaming poo.  The movie is a mashup of Rocky and the Great Santini.  All the clichés are there, from the domestic abuse, to the drinking, to the flashback father-son moments to the slow motion fight scenes.  Toss in a disabled kid for a human touch and a cardboard cutout of a (sort-of) girlfriend.  All of it pretty stinky and predictable.  Wasn't Dorff in a Vampire superhero movie himself?  and it's not like he's been hanging out on Broadway honing his craft and collecting Tony Awards.   So, if you want to see a low-budget, thoughtful, well-acted MMA movie, check out Redbelt.  Otherwise, skip this dreck and rent Black Widow.
/m/embattled	855e6215-dce5-3dfb-9a72-322688e788d0	4.5	It's taking back the pieces of yourself they kept when they broke you !! And when all said and done we are reborn and we see us as we are. We can then read the pain and story behind. For me that's the biggest victory Boykins Jr achieve.  This movie deserves praise for touching on so many valuable sensitive topics at once. Clever cinematography will surely make your heart feel heavy.
/m/embattled	855e6215-dce5-3dfb-9a72-322688e788d0	2.5	It was an actually good story, but the fight scenes were excruciating to watch, the television series Kingdom had it right. Stephen Dorff was amazing as usual, but the way they did some of the scenes well they just fell flat. All in all it was a good script.
/m/embattled	855e6215-dce5-3dfb-9a72-322688e788d0	4.5	Stephen Dorff does a fantastic job of portraying an MMA egomaniac who's cruel to everyone around him. Darren Mann, whom I've never seen before, also does a great job. The movie is gut wrenching and fast paced. Fight scenes are very realistic. Ending is hard to watch but worth hanging in there. I especially enjoyed the downs syndrome, little brother story line. I'd definitely recommend it especially if you like UFC or MMA type fighting.
/m/embattled	855e6215-dce5-3dfb-9a72-322688e788d0	4.5	A film that throws all the punches 👊 and then some! Well, this film was not what I was expecting - and that's a good thing.  Firstly, outstanding casting and performances, especially Darren Mann, and, I'd say an Oscar worthy performance by Stephen Dorff who channeled his inner Conor McGregor, and a drunk deadbeat father and ex, like a champ.  At the start, I was a little lost in the story and it's characters. But then came to realize that even without the MMA storyline, this would've still been an outstanding film about a single mom due to an abusive past relationship, raising her kids on her own - one being in the autistic spectrum. Then add the story of her eldest son who's been manifesting the abusive past relationship with his father. Now how do we mix in some action into this story MMA style? Behold, Embattled.  This is writer David McKenna's only 11th writing credit, and he nailed it like a seasoned screenwriter. This film is a different kind of fighter story, one where the consequences of the fight are more important than the win-loss records of its fighters. It's an unforgettable family dynamics drama, that merely uses MMA as a jumping off point to far more interesting realms about emotional catharsis, both for the characters and for the viewer. The emotional heft of this story makes this one of the best sports films I've seen in a long time.  The cinematography was great and the score very fitting. The 117 min runtime felt a little long with the sometimes slow pacing, and I felt there were a little too many slow-mo shots. But considering this is amateur director Nick Sarkisov's 2nd ever dabble in filmmaking as producer and director, I'm going to be forgiving, because his directing otherwise, was on par with seasoned filmmakers, and for that, mad props and respect.  I can finally say during these times of isolation, this is a must-see film, and I will certainly be watching it again. It's a well deserved 9/10 from me.

This family-friendly fun comedy will have you laughing, bring you joy and inspire you to seize each day.   This movie is about a boy named Marco (Owen Vaccaro) who is insanely addicted to video games. When his grandmother dies and his house nearly burns down, his grandpa, Nonno (Anthony Patellis), moves in. Nonno is extremely bothered with his grandson's obsession with video games. Nonno will not stand for this and takes measures into his own hands. He decides to take away all of Marco's electronics and forces him to play outside. Nonno teaches Marco his favorite sport - bocce ball. Can Marco and his team of friends beat Nonno and his gang of neighborhood Italian bocce ballers in a bocce ball tournament?    This movie was written, directed and produced by Julio Vincent Gambuto, and it is his first feature film. This story is inspired by a real-life experience. About four years ago, when Julio was visiting his nieces and nephews, he noticed that his nephew, Marco, didn't even greet him when he arrived at their house because his head was buried in his electronics. This sparked the idea for his movie. The film takes place in Julio's beloved hometown, Staten Island, NY. It was filmed on location, which was very important to Julio. He loves his hometown community and was passionate about it being filmed on Staten Island. My favorite characters are Nonno and Marco. I really like the performances of Anthony Patellis because of his dry sense of humor and his love of family, which shines through. He is very entertaining while playing the cranky grandpa battling technology. Owen Vaccaro convincingly plays the "pre-teen techie" Marco. I can relate to his love of electronics and his struggles trying to balance Nonno's desire for conversation, friendship and connecting through Nonno's favorite sport, bocce ball. My favorite part of the movie is when Nonno is trying to figure out the Google Assistant.  The main message of the movie is to be present when around your family. This film shows technology is not always bad, and in fact connects us. It also reminds everyone that, while technology will be around forever, your family will not be. Cherish the time you have with your family.    I give Team Marco 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 14, plus adults. Team Marco will be released on most streaming platforms November 20, 2020. Look for it.  Reviewed by Katherine S., KIDS FIRST

/m/team_marco	7f41f9e7-04a4-47f5-a761-059a84bd6e9c	4.5	Such a warm, feel good film to watch!  Highly recommend for families to watch with multiple generations, especially around the holiday season.    The film was cast well and I would love to see Anthony Patellis and Owen Vacarro receive nomination recognition for their acting in this film.  Each portrayed a convincing job, you really felt for their characters.  "Friends are the key to life."

/m/team_marco	7f41f9e7-04a4-47f5-a761-059a84bd6e9c	5	This movie is a must-watch. a True Grandpa love story
/m/team_marco	7f41f9e7-04a4-47f5-a761-059a84bd6e9c	5	I thoroughly enjoyed this family friendly movie. The story had a message, the characters are relatable, and I easily connected to the emotions portrayed. My ten year old nephew, after seeing the movie, wants to play Bocce!
/m/team_marco	7f41f9e7-04a4-47f5-a761-059a84bd6e9c	5	Its a delightful and current-themed full-family film, bridging the gap between young (techno-kids) and old (techno-lost) family members. Hits all the highs and lows, laughs and tears. Lots to talk about around the kitchen table after viewing.
/m/team_marco	7f41f9e7-04a4-47f5-a761-059a84bd6e9c	5	Hands down my FAVORITE new (soon to be iconic) family film, but the adults in your life will love it as much as the kids. Belly laugh-filled, eye-misting, and timely! Brilliantly acted across the board, with the loving touch of writer/director Julio Vincent Gambino evident in every frame.  I've already seen it twice, and since I coach a LOT of young actors, I've recommended it to ALL my students and their parents.  Just pure joy.  And besides, didn't you get your fill of real-life horror by living through 2020 (if you did!)?  If you love it, do take the few minutes to rate and review it, as it's the new way for films to get the word out.  This film deserves it!

/m/fatman	6675e67d-ad9b-3d18-8178-46dd273813ff	4	Nice fresh twist to the same old boring Xmas movies . Mel Gibson has still got it !
/m/fatman	6675e67d-ad9b-3d18-8178-46dd273813ff	5	Santa is not taking shit from anyone. Love me some Mel.
/m/fatman	6675e67d-ad9b-3d18-8178-46dd273813ff	5	Really fun movie. Don’t listen to the negative reviewers who say it didn’t make sense. It’s just meant to be a corny fun Christmas movie with a more intense twist. I loved the characters, Gibson did a great job at making a full on badass Santa, his wife played by Jean-Babtiste was a great version of Mrs. Claus. Goggins was a great goofy Christmas villain, and the kid was so wonderfully annoying. Altogether great movie if you’re looking for a different spin on Christmas lore.
/m/fatman	6675e67d-ad9b-3d18-8178-46dd273813ff	3.5	Has a story line, interesting but not for children.
/m/fatman	6675e67d-ad9b-3d18-8178-46dd273813ff	5	This is a great ORIGINAL story. The leads do a fantastic job.
/m/fatman	6675e67d-ad9b-3d18-8178-46dd273813ff	2.5	It keep switching between taking itself seriously and mocking itself. I don't know what the point of the movie was really. No morals or story that is worth telling here. I guess the only cool thing to note is they made a movie where Santa is a badass gunslinger. Some good scenes here with decent action and a couple laughs.
/m/fatman	6675e67d-ad9b-3d18-8178-46dd273813ff	3	Very slow and tedious.
/m/fatman	6675e67d-ad9b-3d18-8178-46dd273813ff	3.5	A very, very odd Santa movie, this one being an R rated version starring Mel Gibson as jolly Saint Nick(or "Chris" as he goes by here). He's facing some money issues and decides to partner with the US military by having his elves help build them weapons all while being hunted by a hitman who's been given an assassination mission by a rich, snotty 12 year old who got coal for Christmas. Yeah.. it's really something else. Not to be taken too seriously obviously, but I was entertained nonetheless.
/m/fatman	6675e67d-ad9b-3d18-8178-46dd273813ff	3	Mel Gibson's Santa is contracted with the US Government to bring toys to kids...this was a interesting take on Santa Clause so to speak lol and oddly violent.
/m/fatman	6675e67d-ad9b-3d18-8178-46dd273813ff	2	The idea of Chris Kringle is interesting but no I wouldn't both with this one.
/m/jiu_jitsu	0b1e33d4-68c5-37d7-a49d-22fc513e93bb	3	Good fighting scenes nothing else though
/m/jiu_jitsu	0b1e33d4-68c5-37d7-a49d-22fc513e93bb	0.5	The premise of the movie is interesting - but the execution fails. Lead actor has a single expression during the entire movie: confused, which is an apt description of what anyone watching this will feel.
/m/jiu_jitsu	0b1e33d4-68c5-37d7-a49d-22fc513e93bb	1	100 minutes of jiu jitsu fights, all equal, but you'll miss that bore during those 10 minutes they stop to fight and act so bad you suspect they're doing it on purpose to win a Razzie.  I believe they were drunk one night: "burp! what if we make a mashup of western and cooking recipes?"  "naaah, let's mix football game with sewing!" "wait friends, let's mix 70s bruce lee movies with predator!"  "WOW GREAT IDEA! but... what could be the plot?" "who cares of the plot, we put fight scenes during the whole movie, so spectators don't get we don't have any idea!"
/m/jiu_jitsu	0b1e33d4-68c5-37d7-a49d-22fc513e93bb	1.5	I think this movie's biggest flaw was the incredible lack of plot! There was just nothing to it but one random battle scene after another, with a whole lot of NOTHINGNESS in between! I felt like I was in a video game, except I didn't have the controller in my hand to control my man. It was a very strange paradox, I can assure you.
/m/jiu_jitsu	0b1e33d4-68c5-37d7-a49d-22fc513e93bb	1	Jiu Jitsu is absolute nonsense. None of the narrative joins together, to the point of frustration. Cage barely shows his face, despite his reportedly handsome payday. Fight the temptation to watch this.
/m/jiu_jitsu	0b1e33d4-68c5-37d7-a49d-22fc513e93bb	1	Got to be one of the worst movies I have ever watched, think I even fell asleep at some point…
/m/jiu_jitsu	0b1e33d4-68c5-37d7-a49d-22fc513e93bb	0.5	That was probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen
/m/jiu_jitsu	0b1e33d4-68c5-37d7-a49d-22fc513e93bb	1	garbage plot and awful acting. Cage was the best thing about this movie
/m/jiu_jitsu	0b1e33d4-68c5-37d7-a49d-22fc513e93bb	1.5	A budget of $25 Million, where did it all go? It wasn't on CGI or sound effects! I think I saw someone blink and get a WOOSH sound effect. Well at least it made $99K at the box office to date, someone got a great tax right off.
/m/jiu_jitsu	0b1e33d4-68c5-37d7-a49d-22fc513e93bb	0.5	Terrible. Absolutely terrible.
/m/blindfire	39e42c81-02a7-325b-848f-411f6cff4929	1	Socially irresponsible movie.   Can we please stop making movies about bad actors in our society from their point of view and over sympathizing with them...
/m/blindfire	39e42c81-02a7-325b-848f-411f6cff4929	0.5	If I could rate this film 0 it would be a 0, the description on the film is wrong, dreadful story of a hostage situation and someone gets killed only to find out the initial call was a prank call! No detective work apart from investigating PlayStation chats, which I still don't get why he did that with 0 leads. Worse film seen this year and I've seen a few bad ones

/m/blindfire	39e42c81-02a7-325b-848f-411f6cff4929	5	I enjoyed Blindfire. The suspense and the empathy I felt for the characters made this an excellent film. My wife Teresa said two thumbs up.

/m/blindfire	39e42c81-02a7-325b-848f-411f6cff4929	5	A great movie with a powerful message. Loved it.
/m/blindfire	39e42c81-02a7-325b-848f-411f6cff4929	5	In a time where the divide between law enforcement and minority communities and other at risk communities is so large this timely film showcases what accountability and justice should look like in the future and is hopefully a conversation starter.
/m/blindfire	39e42c81-02a7-325b-848f-411f6cff4929	5	Amazing movie, and storyline! Good movie for the time we are in now! Shoutout to Mike Nell!! :)
/m/blindfire	39e42c81-02a7-325b-848f-411f6cff4929	5	Excellent movie from start to finish. Kept my attention the entire time. The way the story was pieces together throughout the film was seamless. Very impressed and highly recommend!!
/m/blindfire	39e42c81-02a7-325b-848f-411f6cff4929	5	A must-see dramatic film that is spot-on topical to current events. Terrific ensemble cast. Writer/Director Mike Nell's script does something that is hard to achieve in today's cinema: it speaks the "Truth." The ending might surprise you, and haunt you... but no doubt will leave you talking about the film for a long time afterwards. And the glimmer of hope that ends the narrative gives the viewer some solace that perhaps we can indeed move forward in today's divisive times. Please see this film!
/m/the_orange_years_the_nickelodeon_story	0ba6aea2-1676-3b44-afff-77834b85b51a	3.5	A great walk down memory lane that chronologically details the highlights at Nickelodeon and the effect on culture, one that will always resonate for a certain generation.
/m/the_orange_years_the_nickelodeon_story	0ba6aea2-1676-3b44-afff-77834b85b51a	3.5	I came of age in the late '80s and early '90s, and in retrospect, I'm not sure there was a single more powerful influence on those formative years than Nickelodeon. Pinwheel and Danger Mouse colored my earliest memories, Double Dare and Mr. Wizard arrived a bit later, Salute Your Shorts and Ren & Stimpy spoke to me as a pre-teen... it seemed that as I grew and matured, so did the network, catering its programming to meet what I wanted or needed at that specific point in my life.  Looking back at it here, through a wide-angled lens, I was startled by how much of this material has lingered in my long-term memory banks and still, subtly, feeds my personality today. That's where The Orange Years makes its hay: coasting through a laundry list of beloved short-run TV shows and catchy pre-commercial bumpers, refreshing fond recollections in its audience while serving a dash of backstage skinny to better humanize the men and women behind this little network that could. And that's really what it was, at least in the early days: a boutique cable channel, catering to a very specific market, in an era before that was a proven formula.  The peeks behind the curtain are wonderful and inspiring - happy conversations with stars, creators and executives who are still jazzed about the product, twenty years after moving on - but the greater urge to service nearly every original property with some degree of inspection grows tiresome after nearly two hours. Should've been twenty minutes shorter.
/m/the_orange_years_the_nickelodeon_story	0ba6aea2-1676-3b44-afff-77834b85b51a	5	This was such a nostalgic trip through my childhood days of watching all the shows from Nickelodeon's golden years. It was also fascinating seeing the history of the network and setting out to create something that spoke to the average, everyday kid. Not only that, a kid who's not as popular or athletic, and is deemed as the goofy, awkward, or odd, and is put in front and center that says to embrace those qualities. That was most likely what made many boys and girls of many backgrounds come in droves, because this was something that they felt was a place to be themselves without authority figures telling them otherwise. I think a lot of people forget that this was the first network that was actively progressive, in which kids of different race and gender were brought under the spotlight. As someone who has these kinds of qualities as a child, this was something that I was naturally drawn to and made me an avid Nickelodeon kid. This really was a huge part of my life growing up, and to watch a documentary that puts emphasis on the culture that I was actually part of makes me believe that I was part of something unique and unforgettable.
/m/the_orange_years_the_nickelodeon_story	0ba6aea2-1676-3b44-afff-77834b85b51a	4	"The Orange Years: The Nickelodeon Story" was incredibly good.  I have to admit that I am the perfect demographic for this documentary, having lived through these years as a child, but even if it weren't for that, it is still just an amazingly well put together package that really captures the time.  I was absolutely stunned by all of the people they managed to get for interviews.  I give it a B, next time you're in the mood for a movie, this one won't disappoint.
/m/the_orange_years_the_nickelodeon_story	0ba6aea2-1676-3b44-afff-77834b85b51a	5	Incredibly nostalgic for this xennial that grew up watching Nickelodeon and Snick in the 90s!

/m/the_orange_years_the_nickelodeon_story	0ba6aea2-1676-3b44-afff-77834b85b51a	5	Great trip down memory lane. Wish they showed more of the old stuff like Belle and Sebastian or the Little Prince
/m/the_orange_years_the_nickelodeon_story	0ba6aea2-1676-3b44-afff-77834b85b51a	5	This was a fantastic voyage back to my childhood! It was great seeing the history of Nick and how they grew through the years as we grew along with them.  What a great energetic and caring documentary!
/m/the_orange_years_the_nickelodeon_story	0ba6aea2-1676-3b44-afff-77834b85b51a	3	For anybody growing up on the old school Nickelodeon days (like myself) its a worth while trip down memory lane, even though it did feel a bit like a commercial for its own brand, while not touching on any controversial or failures. Even though, its a blast to sit though, and will make you want to be a kid again during those days.

Battle ensues and colonists withdraw leaving squad gunner stranded on a desert planet...  I liked the angle they took on war and human nature. It is not like Enemy mine.

/m/dune_drifter	6c052548-b15d-4496-80aa-ee9cbe55907d	0.5	Terrible, Terrible movie. Waste of 5.99  Please don't waste your money
/m/dune_drifter	6c052548-b15d-4496-80aa-ee9cbe55907d	4	Definitely wasn't expecting this. A good thriller.
/m/dune_drifter	6c052548-b15d-4496-80aa-ee9cbe55907d	0.5	Why I don't ever pay attention to tomatometers! These must be usually pajama kids in their mom's basements watching a lot of movies during the lockdown and suddenly they're a professional critic. Best Sci-fi of 2021! Put down the bong and walk away!!!  The first half of the movie is a space battle with a soundtrack filled with elite pilots agonizingly screaming like little girls! On the planet more screaming. Seriously, my subtitles are constantly agonizingly this or agonizingly that!   Then there's the duel in the sun with multiple aliens wearing old motocross suits and jeans. It doesn't matter 'cause their aim is worse than the worst of the worst Stormtroopers.  Just a pitiful waste of time for all concerned-including me and the cast! At least I had other things to keep me busy instead of being bored out of my skull!
/m/dune_drifter	6c052548-b15d-4496-80aa-ee9cbe55907d	4	Low budget yes, but an engaging film none the less!
/m/dune_drifter	6c052548-b15d-4496-80aa-ee9cbe55907d	4	Great action and suspense, but kind of low budget. Nav computers when there are space wars and warp drives look like they're using vintage 1985 DOS OS. And the enemy's costume looks like they got a deal on some scuba gear. Still, an intense fun movie.
/m/dune_drifter	6c052548-b15d-4496-80aa-ee9cbe55907d	4	Low budget sci-fi, but it knows its limitations and doesn't stray too far over that line.  Minimal actors and props, sparse but interesting location, fairly simple story.  It takes that story and gives us a decent main character to follow, a little character development, and better acting than you usually see in something like this.  Most effects are done well enough not to be overly noticeable, and even has a pretty good space battle at the beginning.  Brings to mind similar movies like "Hunter Prey" and "Prospect".
/m/dune_drifter	6c052548-b15d-4496-80aa-ee9cbe55907d	4	Good sci fi short story type action survival movie.
/m/dune_drifter	6c052548-b15d-4496-80aa-ee9cbe55907d	2	the reason i watch is because of high tomatometer. but its disapponting and  i dont know how it can get high rating. it is dark and you cannot see the view and details. dont do sci-fi movie on low budget..people want to see the imaginary world and techs projected properly on screen.
/m/dune_drifter	6c052548-b15d-4496-80aa-ee9cbe55907d	3	In the beginning of this movie are a bunch of what you think would be highly trained, elite interstellar fighter pilots yelling and screaming like babies in their cribs when their ships take a hit. Who is the idiot who thought showing soldiers as complete wimps would work? I almost stopped watching, but after that it turned into a not terrible movie.  Nothing new or particularly exciting but somehow not bad.
/m/king_of_knives	5f8df8dd-4082-4b68-82d0-fd68c7a8f2d7	1	The characters are not believable, the acting was wooden... It felt like a student film. I genuinely do not understand why this movie is so highly rated on here.
/m/king_of_knives	5f8df8dd-4082-4b68-82d0-fd68c7a8f2d7	0.5	Bad movie. Story had no build up, no real climax. Few endearing moments for the characters, especially the main character. Lots of filler moments. I found unwatchable at times.
/m/king_of_knives	5f8df8dd-4082-4b68-82d0-fd68c7a8f2d7	5	Excellent! Intense, profound, thought provoking storyline. Characters were real. Touches on so many relevant situations, approaches them from different levels of understanding  and misunderstanding. Complicated situations in the life of what appears to be a normal family. Sad but real. Having lost an adult child it was difficult. But this movie brings to life what that loss brings to a family. Nothing is the same again. And to move on from that impacts everyone in so many ways. Would love to see what happens next!  It's the kind of movie you have to discuss with someone when it is over.
/m/king_of_knives	5f8df8dd-4082-4b68-82d0-fd68c7a8f2d7	5	Amazing movie. Great acting. Fantastic story. A must see!!!
/m/king_of_knives	5f8df8dd-4082-4b68-82d0-fd68c7a8f2d7	5	A very funny dark comedy about a very dysfunctional family. Perfect to watch around the holidays because it will make you appreciate your family that much more!!

/m/truth_is_the_only_client	0f531c30-0c2f-3157-9fe9-f011e0267df7	0.5	Had the critics actually studied the assassination, which I guarantee they haven't, they would find that the evidence against Lee Harvey Oswald has so many contradictions, and inconsistencies that it doesn't add up at all. Fact of the matter is, the JFK assassination was a conspiracy, and its easy to prove so. That is if you analyze the evidence on both sides of the debate unbiasedly. Once you do, you'll find that the evidence for a conspiracy is so overwhelming, and that Oswald was framed for the crime. I recommend the critics read my book on the case Death of Democracy.
/m/trail_of_ashes	36111bba-292b-4176-8f77-feb78138784d	0.5	Slow ,boring , rubbish story . Grade B
/m/trail_of_ashes	36111bba-292b-4176-8f77-feb78138784d	3	This film has all the elements of being great, but I tired of its two-note presentation. It could really benefit being run through the hands of a skilled editor, who knows how to ignite the rhythms of scenes and story elements.  If this were based on a book, I would really be interested in reading it.
/m/trail_of_ashes	36111bba-292b-4176-8f77-feb78138784d	4	It was dense but LOVED the atmosphere of it all.
/m/trail_of_ashes	36111bba-292b-4176-8f77-feb78138784d	4	Great cinematography and a new take on the fantasy genre. Pleasantly surprised.
/m/trail_of_ashes	36111bba-292b-4176-8f77-feb78138784d	3.5	An interesting mix of genres.
/m/trail_of_ashes	36111bba-292b-4176-8f77-feb78138784d	3.5	I'm always a sucker for genre mixing especially when one of those genres is fantasy. Trail of Ashes attempts to try something different but it doesn't always work out in the end. Even so I feel like the acting from director/writer  Arturo Lizardi along with the cinematography are more than enough to keep people intrigued.  For more please check out my Youtube channel.
/m/trail_of_ashes	36111bba-292b-4176-8f77-feb78138784d	3	MEH. Kept falling asleep during it, it was so lack luster. Basically for me it would be great background noise for doing dishes.
/m/trail_of_ashes	36111bba-292b-4176-8f77-feb78138784d	1	Extremely slow. Good visuals but the narrative was horrible.
/m/trail_of_ashes	36111bba-292b-4176-8f77-feb78138784d	4	Trail of Ashes is a lot of good things. A slow burn, a suspenseful dark fantasy thriller, a beautiful looking/editing, world building, intense, Film d'auteur. All of this in a very character focused history, that makes me think more of an Akira Kurosawa film or similar genres; this could be because I've been watching Kurosawa films recently.   Other than Kurosawa films, it makes me feel the same as some of the following movies: Under My Skin, The Witch and The Fountain. So, if you like one of those, maybe you should check out Trail of Ashes.  The film has a very heavy atmosphere and dark enough in its tones. This isn't a movie for casual audience, but one that the cinephiles will like. Has great music, lead by a beautiful cello. It's very dense and has a deep story along with great characters; it's hard to believe the achievement met by this indie production.
/m/trail_of_ashes	36111bba-292b-4176-8f77-feb78138784d	5	Well this was an interesting film. Fascinating story, great job!
/m/the_bloodhound	43d1fc0f-4abd-42f0-83b5-90d9200da9c2	4	I have to give this a high mark for originality if nothing else. I've never been more scared in a movie where nothing terrifying happens. It's a strange experience, a new kind of emotional terror.
/m/the_bloodhound	43d1fc0f-4abd-42f0-83b5-90d9200da9c2	2	Truly strange retelling of Poe.  Francis visits his old school aged friend and his twin sister in a house where a wet guy slides around on the floor.
/m/the_bloodhound	43d1fc0f-4abd-42f0-83b5-90d9200da9c2	3	Interesante como ejercicio de estilo, y me gusta mucho sus personajes pero tampoco su historia me dice mucho, por muy basada que esté en La Caida de la Casa Usher. Lo mismo deberia leemer el relato de Poe.
/m/the_bloodhound	43d1fc0f-4abd-42f0-83b5-90d9200da9c2	0.5	Don't waste your time or money to watch this movie. Total Crap.
/m/that_good_night	76d18f8f-bb1e-37e1-9507-86ec1eac15a0	5	This movie is absolutely brilliant! What an emotional rollercoaster!
/m/ryuichi_sakamoto_coda	920ce1de-61c1-4a48-8312-4a6962c5edfa	3	One would think that someone who has lived as an extraordinary life as Ryuichi Sakamoto would deserve a more engaging document of his career.
/m/ryuichi_sakamoto_coda	920ce1de-61c1-4a48-8312-4a6962c5edfa	5	An incredible film about an incredible man.
/m/ryuichi_sakamoto_coda	920ce1de-61c1-4a48-8312-4a6962c5edfa	2.5	At times violence for the sake of violence.  The point could have been made without the all the violence.  Disappointed.
/m/ryuichi_sakamoto_coda	920ce1de-61c1-4a48-8312-4a6962c5edfa	5	AWESOME! This movie takes lot's of twists and turns that really get you on the edge of your seat, definitley a must have!!!
/m/ryuichi_sakamoto_coda	920ce1de-61c1-4a48-8312-4a6962c5edfa	5	An intimate and poignant portrait of the greatest living composer. Sakamoto dialogues with Nature and lays himself bare by telling us about the disease that has struck him. Speaking of Bach he says that "his chorales were the voice of a people who were suffering, hungry, dying of the plague. The music inspired by Fukushima must be the choral of my times, with its tragedies". Masterpiece.
/m/ryuichi_sakamoto_coda	920ce1de-61c1-4a48-8312-4a6962c5edfa	5	Sometimes you don't know you need to see a film until you see it. This is one of those films. Recommended most highly.
/m/ryuichi_sakamoto_coda	920ce1de-61c1-4a48-8312-4a6962c5edfa	5	Brilliant movie but very violet and could not watch again
/m/ryuichi_sakamoto_coda	920ce1de-61c1-4a48-8312-4a6962c5edfa	5	Goes deep into the creative process and mentality of Sakamoto - who is an absolute genius with an incredible body of work. He reflections and passion are captured with wonderful authenticity. I listen to his music often. --- this film is a treasure.
/m/ryuichi_sakamoto_coda	920ce1de-61c1-4a48-8312-4a6962c5edfa	5	Really glad to have seen this inspiring movie... to spent a moment observing Mr. Sakamoto's thoughts and life also his method of creating masterpieces. The way he sees/thinks about his music is exceptional and get me thinking about myself...my way of perceiving arts! Human forces nature to create a piece of art. Nature has its own way in doing so as well. Untidiness and formlessness might actually be the art of nature. This way of thinking is explained in the movie through a piano surviving tsunami....and I feel like...this is the first time I really understand "such a cliche say"  A true artist...a real legend.  May god bless him with power and strength to fight the cancer ??????
/m/ryuichi_sakamoto_coda	920ce1de-61c1-4a48-8312-4a6962c5edfa	4.5	Sakamoto returns to music after battling cancer. A new outlook on life leads him to create his next masterpiece. This is an intimate look into the life of the man and Oscar-winning film composer. This documentary made me want to leave and create something. It was so inspiring. I didn't know until I saw the trailer that this was the composer of "Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"- a long-lost favorite song of mine.  You get to see the joy this man gets from discovering that perfect sound. He does the weirdest things to find it. He travels across the world just to unearth that pure sound. Through who he is, what he does, what he says, you know this is what he lives for. You can feel it. This is such a beautiful portrait of an artist. So inspiring.
/m/wolfmans_got_nards	a9ca775d-61be-30bc-897d-be62e459b82a	5	I love the Monster Squad! Getting a behind the scenes look at the making and legacy of the movie gives me a newfound appreciation for the work that went towards it!
/m/wolfmans_got_nards	a9ca775d-61be-30bc-897d-be62e459b82a	5	To say this documentary is amazing would be the understatement of the century. It is so full of love and insight. Beautifully crafted to highlight the fans of this 80s masterpiece. It touches your heart in a way that makes you feel fulfilled and wanting more!!! In one word....perfect.❤
/m/wolfmans_got_nards	a9ca775d-61be-30bc-897d-be62e459b82a	5	I loved this doc, Andre has made an amazingly heart felt movie, and it's clear how proud he is of what The Monster Squad has become.
/m/wolfmans_got_nards	a9ca775d-61be-30bc-897d-be62e459b82a	5	This doc is incredible. It was made with a lot of love from the lead actor of The Monster Squad. Its a great story of how it became a classic and found a second life in the 2000s.
/m/wolfmans_got_nards	a9ca775d-61be-30bc-897d-be62e459b82a	5	I loved it. It is a heart warming documentary about us fans of The Monster Squad.Andre Gower did an awesome job putting it together with the help of his Producer Henry McComas and I love how he got Ashley Bank and Ryan Lambert and Fred Dekker to talk about their thoughts.Even if you haven't seen The Monster Squad you will love this documentary it is not like any other documentary. It is an amazing and awesome tribute to us fans . Andre put fan art in and even Has Ryan Lambert's bands music in it and has a heartfelt tribute to the late Brent Chalem. I give it 5 plus stars.Come watch it and become part of the club.

/m/wolfmans_got_nards	a9ca775d-61be-30bc-897d-be62e459b82a	2.5	A fun but forgetful film
/m/wolfmans_got_nards	a9ca775d-61be-30bc-897d-be62e459b82a	5	A movie that focuses on delivering what its intended audience wants is always a breath of fresh air.  If you don't like it, its because you never liked Monster Squad.  Go watch something else and leave this beautiful homage alone.
/m/wolfmans_got_nards	a9ca775d-61be-30bc-897d-be62e459b82a	5	Such a fantastic documentary! Just stumbled across it.  The original movie was a few years before my time, but it has become an annual favorite for me and my kids every Halloween.  It's one of the top 3 or so movies my kids want to watch during the season...my 12 year old daughter loves it all...my younger kids want to watch the kick him in the nards scene 100 times over :)
/m/wolfmans_got_nards	a9ca775d-61be-30bc-897d-be62e459b82a	5	A great documentary about an excellent childhood film. Miss the days when kid films weren't afraid to be a bit darker and more serious at times. Great flick.
/m/the_informer_2020	763275f0-221f-4da1-8f62-2c0a1febf57a	3.5	Even if hard to follow at times Kinnerman De Armas and Common all put solid performances in to keep you interested
/m/the_informer_2020	763275f0-221f-4da1-8f62-2c0a1febf57a	4.5	Enjoyed this story about the FBI's treatment of a vet who committed a crime that was not his fault. Joel Kinneman was super intense and some of the gangsters came as highly realistic to me, nothing glamorous, just creepy. Good intense and suspenseful film.
/m/the_informer_2020	763275f0-221f-4da1-8f62-2c0a1febf57a	4	Another fun and likable performance by Kinnamen.  Good plot that doesn't drag but could go deeper.  Still you'll feel entertained by this one.
/m/the_informer_2020	763275f0-221f-4da1-8f62-2c0a1febf57a	5	it is a very action movie. it keeps you on suspense the cast is great . you Care about the family and  want to everything be good for them and also the action is 👌🏻
/m/the_informer_2020	763275f0-221f-4da1-8f62-2c0a1febf57a	2.5	The informer is an action thriller starring Joel Kinnaman that sees him as a former criminal and soldier is hired by the FBI to infiltrate the Polish mafia to bring them down. This of course brings all kinds of problems and leads to some good drama and some good action scenes. The movie is not too bad as Kinnaman does a good job of portraying a father and husband who is eventually betrayed and is stuck between the authorities and the criminal underworld. Clive Owen is here as an FBI director with some shaddy motives and as always he brings a strong presence but the movie is not always as interesting. The action scenes are good but the movie focuses on the thriller of watching Kinnaman attempt to keep himself alive in a quite difficult situation and the movie does not always balance than well making it uneven. Common as a police officer wanting to uncover the truth is fun but in the end Common is a great singer not a great actor. In the end the movie is a bit fun but the drama is not always enough to keep it floating.
/m/the_informer_2020	763275f0-221f-4da1-8f62-2c0a1febf57a	4	Solid story with great acting . Perfect! Thanks!
/m/the_informer_2020	763275f0-221f-4da1-8f62-2c0a1febf57a	3.5	An entertaining movie that, unfortunately, does not provide any surprises or thrills.  The real bad guys are easily identifiable early on and, unless the moviemakers were really willing to gamble on a truly sideways ending, the outcome was ever present.  However, the movie was satisfying in that characters got what they deserved in the end, and the acting performances on the ride are worth the watch.
/m/the_informer_2020	763275f0-221f-4da1-8f62-2c0a1febf57a	4	I thought it was a 4 starer only because I don’t like Clive Owen.
/m/the_informer_2020	763275f0-221f-4da1-8f62-2c0a1febf57a	3	Easy to watch. Plot could have been a little more in depth and fine into more development. All in all an easy to watch movie
/m/the_informer_2020	763275f0-221f-4da1-8f62-2c0a1febf57a	3	Formulaic as hell, but with its star-studded cast that has a rough-and-tough Joel Kinnaman (I've liked the dude since ‘The Killing' and as far as I'm concerned, he plays a certain type of role -- THIS type of role -- better than most other bona fide action stars) at its helm, ‘The Informer' is one of those no-brainer action thriller's that is just there to entertain and nothing more.

/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	4	excellent film...saw it via Prime Video, but would like a DVD copy...anyone know if/when it will be released on DVD???
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	5	It was great. In Boy Howdy We Trust.
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	4.5	I grew up reading CREEM, literally. I was born in 1972 and reading by the age of 3. I was obsessed with music and probably first saw CREEM from my parents at a very young age. I learned so much from that magazine and honestly the documentary showed me even more. I always wondered about that bunch beyond Lester Bangs (as I have read his books and Jim Dero's book) and this film showed it all. I literally waited a year to see it, tweeting the magazine demanding it's release, and rented it immediately. I want to own this on DVD and am excited for the 50th anniversary issue. This is a must see for any music fan. So well done.
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	5	The best Roc Doc I've seen!! A rock ‘n' roll magazine for the people and I'm so glad on its return. I look forward to what they do next!
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	5	Inspiring and fun to watch the music industry at a time when there where so many incredible artist. Refreshing to see a female perspective on being a journalist during that time too.
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	5	Better than Star Wars! My expectations were high, as a high school Creem junkie, and it does not disappoint. Wish it ran longer to include the Bill Holdship years but I think it makes for a better film to end it where they do. A+!
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	5	A must for any classic rock / punk fan. While everyone has heard of bad boy rock journalist Lester Bangs, there were many more who played instrumental roles and are a given the spotlight in this documentary.  Nice mix of archival footage mixed with "talking head" style recollections.  For a documentary, it cooks along and you're instantly engaged.
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	5	Creem had something special going for it, and the movie really conveyed that - this was a family affair, with a core, passionate group of wacky and smart people that loved what they were doing, where they were doing it (Detroit), and seemed like they were (mostly) having fun. In this day and age of print mags continuing to shutter, and rock journalism becoming a thing of the past (do the kids even know about Lester Bangs anymore?), this was a really nice reminder of what once was…..A no-holds barred, don't give a fuck attitude magazine that covered music that other people didn't care about (yet). The ability to reflect on cool shit that happened and speak to the people involved while they are for the most part still alive is why people make documentaries. The tale was told well, and made me wish I had some copies to flip through. I might have to track down some back issues…oh wait, I just pre-ordered the 50th anniversary commemorative issue AND a t-shirt. What are you doing today? Nothing, right? What a perfect day to watch.
/m/creem_americas_only_rock_n_roll_magazine	6a353eb7-5e38-36d5-b1fa-7f93a8739d20	5	Loved this doc about a magazine that was so important to music fans in the Seventies and Eighties. The iconoclastic CREEM was the alternative to the staid Rolling Stone, and this film captures a good deal of the energy of the era and those who wrote for the mag. Breezy, informative, and full of rock history, this doc is a pleasure to watch.
/m/honey_bee_2019	68c0b2f7-184f-30c7-b757-c2abc9e57dfd	5	This movie so underrated. It deserves so much credit for all the effort and the story line put into this movie. This generation deserves more movies like these.
/m/honey_bee_2019	68c0b2f7-184f-30c7-b757-c2abc9e57dfd	2.5	'Honey Bee' was a film I wanted to like a lot.  It has Martha Plimpton for crying out loud.  Unfortunately, a movie that borders on a world that is very dangerous was portrayed as kinda ok, and then really horrible. Rama Rau flirts, but never really gives the viewer a profound reason to root for our underaged prostitute.  We get very little back story and there are sudden tonal shifts that just make the film even more unrealistic.  At its heart there's some fine acting (and some not so fine), but overall it's frustrating.  Julia Sarah Stone is so perfectly cast.  Despite being well older than her supposed 16, she's committed to the character.  The third act is uneven and muddled, yet we're left with not a whole heck of a lot resolved.  It's a mixed bag. Final Score: 5/10
/m/honey_bee_2019	68c0b2f7-184f-30c7-b757-c2abc9e57dfd	5	Raw and gripping tale of tragedy and rejection with a glimmer of hope for salvation, with an amazing soundtrack to export.

/m/nomad_in_the_footsteps_of_bruce_chatwin	90a8b899-3fc0-3781-91fb-0853d0082447	3.5	It's beyond apparent the admiration Werner Herzog had for his friend and subject in his latest documentary, Bruce Chatwin.  Herzog does his standard narration and he will once again polarize audiences who will inevitably dispute the value of his work.  Beauty is, after all, in the eye of the beholder.  Truth is we all should be lucky enough to be eulogized by Werner Herzog.  When the film wraps up and the pieces of it go through your mind you get a picture into the genius of our fabled filmmaker.  While this wasn't his best, it's still worth viewing especially if you're a fan!  Final Score: 6.5/10
/m/nomad_in_the_footsteps_of_bruce_chatwin	90a8b899-3fc0-3781-91fb-0853d0082447	1	Good god this is an awful movie about nobody. Even worse, the soundtrack. Horrible music.
/m/nomad_in_the_footsteps_of_bruce_chatwin	90a8b899-3fc0-3781-91fb-0853d0082447	1	Boring! I should have left halfway through the movie but I kept thinking it would get better. I can’t believe this movie was actually released for the theatre. It is something that is better seen at home on the Smithsonian channel or something similar. I thought the movie would have beautiful cinematography but that was far too rare of an occurrence. Don’t waste your money seeing this one! The worst movie I’ve seen in a long time!
/m/terra_willy	427b46ee-0f08-3683-b476-6d8824df0461	4	A refreshing change to see a French 3D adventure animated film. Based in space and on an unknown planet, Willy is a natural born explorer as he encounters all sorts of cool alien creatures ranging from small to very large. The character/creature styles are fairly simple but well designed and nicely rendered, and the animation is smooth and fun. Not sure if there's a dubbed version for kids, but I'd recommend the native French language because it sounds cool.
/m/terra_willy	427b46ee-0f08-3683-b476-6d8824df0461	5	My two daughters (5 and7) and I loved it! It was so good we watched it two times in a row.

/m/terra_willy	427b46ee-0f08-3683-b476-6d8824df0461	0.5	I don't like this movie and no more
/m/terra_willy	427b46ee-0f08-3683-b476-6d8824df0461	2	Shame, really had my hopes up for this one, it had potential but the makers really had their feet off the gas since the start. The story was some what decent but visuals were stunning, however was ultimately let down by its poor scripting, structuring & sound editing/music.
/m/terra_willy	427b46ee-0f08-3683-b476-6d8824df0461	4	The film is good at almost every moment, we have the adventure of seeing a new and unknown place, together with hints of humor with the evolution (even if not very significant) of the personality of Robot Buck and the maturing of Willy. The only problems I see in this film are: the ease that the boy had in his survival after he was without Buck and the ending that brings the feeling that something is missing, some scene, the film could have shown something more, but I don't see it as a defect, but as a personal thing of mine. Conclusion: it is an excellent film for children, perhaps good for teenagers and a little childish for adults and the elderly.
/m/the_true_adventures_of_wolfboy	e53cea16-5026-4b09-8430-e048f7d3a3af	4	This movie starts off a little shakily but stay with it, the characters will soon draw you in to this wonderful coming of age story.

/m/the_true_adventures_of_wolfboy	e53cea16-5026-4b09-8430-e048f7d3a3af	5	Fun movie with lots of feels - love, angst, youth, self-acceptance. My (older) kids and I really enjoyed it.
/m/the_true_adventures_of_wolfboy	e53cea16-5026-4b09-8430-e048f7d3a3af	5	What a delightful movie - packed with heart, fun, thoughtfulness, and a hint of "real world magic" - all of which really sucks you in.  You owe it to yourself to see it!
/m/the_true_adventures_of_wolfboy	e53cea16-5026-4b09-8430-e048f7d3a3af	5	Jaeden Martell's performance is truly heartfelt. A very captivating piece. Loved it 🖤
/m/the_true_adventures_of_wolfboy	e53cea16-5026-4b09-8430-e048f7d3a3af	3	Inside this 90-minute movie is a spectacular 30-minute short film.  There are two fantastic main players, Jaeden Martell and Sophia Giannamore.  As Paul/Wolfboy Jaeden's delivery is mostly thoughtful and heartfelt. He's a likeable actor, even under intense makeup.   As Aristiana, Sophia is magical and mesmerizing. Giannamore's acting bio's all disclose that she is a transgender actor, so I want to mention it. She is spectacular.  Had the film focused on Paul and Aristiana, it would have been much stronger. Instead, it gets derailed by two subplots that are supposed to add spark, but actually dilute.  The entire John Turturro character/setting could have infused oddball wisdom, but it goes in the wrong direction and becomes about Turturro's character, not Paul.  Chris Messina's talents are wasted. His character comes across as a dad who just met his son and is trying to forge a bond. But the story arc would have us believe that the father and son have been together since the boy's birth when the mother disappeared.  The actor who portrays the cop must have had a Groupon for cop acting school. The flat performance saves Turturro from being at the bottom.  The film regains its emotional strength with Chloe Sevigny and Stephen McKinley as her father.  There are memorable lines and scenes in this film, but there's far too much padding and overreach in between.
/m/a_rainy_day_in_new_york	bfd1d359-c27f-32b4-9f66-658ed62201dd	1	I had hoped A Rainy Day In New York might be one more Woody Allen film just enjoyable enough to make me mostly forget about its singular creative force. But unfortunately, that hope was crushed by the movie immediately, with acclaimed actor Timothee Chalamet, who plays a college student, channeling octogenarian Woody Allen's words and mannerisms. The writing was more fake and out of place for all the characters than anything Allen's ever done. I mean, I don't know all his films, but it's gotta be the worse or one of the worse films he ever made. I can't believe these (award-winning) actors did this awful movie. It won't happen again.
/m/a_rainy_day_in_new_york	bfd1d359-c27f-32b4-9f66-658ed62201dd	4.5	A brilliant Woody Allen that is like a warm tea with honey in the middle of winter. The film grossed $2744 in its opening weekend in the US. I think that and the bad US reviews (as well as the usual protests about Allen's personal life) say it all about culture having gone down the drain in the US to be replaced by tabloid thinking. We live in sad enough times to worry about what people think. I'm just glad that I got to see this movie gem but shocked by the American film critics. I mean, aren't most movies coming from Hollywood crap? So what are you exactly comparing this to? The actors of this film were pressure into giving money away. Now when you play in a Woody Allen movie, you have to pay ransom in the US.
/m/a_rainy_day_in_new_york	bfd1d359-c27f-32b4-9f66-658ed62201dd	0.5	Worst Allen film I've ever seen, and one of ghe worst films ever.  20 somethings all talking with Allenish affectations, speaking dialouge that is tired repeats of Allen's work from 30 years ago.  Simply put, Allen's perspective is quirky, but reliving it tnrough a meaningless story where everyone is Allen, is so painful, unrealistic, and overdone as to be embarassing.
/m/a_rainy_day_in_new_york	bfd1d359-c27f-32b4-9f66-658ed62201dd	4	I found it funny, fresh, witty, and eventfully entertaining.
/m/a_rainy_day_in_new_york	bfd1d359-c27f-32b4-9f66-658ed62201dd	5	All of the  heavyweight actors perform at the top of their game, making the most of Allen's masterful command of film language. But it's the sparklingly hilarious work of Elle Fanning that steals the show.
/m/a_rainy_day_in_new_york	bfd1d359-c27f-32b4-9f66-658ed62201dd	3	Surprised by the acting chops of Selena Gomez.
/m/a_rainy_day_in_new_york	bfd1d359-c27f-32b4-9f66-658ed62201dd	3.5	I enjoyed watching this film. It's very Allenesque, if you like that. Even Timothee feels like Allen in some passages. I like the script more than the direction; I think that's where it somehow doesn't become better. It's missing something, but altogether fun & nice ending.
/m/a_rainy_day_in_new_york	bfd1d359-c27f-32b4-9f66-658ed62201dd	4	I'm on here to say that I think Elle Fanning is absolutely brilliant in this. It's just perfect comic acting. I take this movie to be meant as something frothy and light, elegant and filled with fantasy. There's art to something like that, and it can be done well or badly, and here it's done well. But sure, there are little skips in logic here, like the Fanning character, I imagine, losing her phone, but that not being addressed at all.   I'm torn about the allegation against Woody Allen. I'm certainly not dismissing it.
/m/a_rainy_day_in_new_york	bfd1d359-c27f-32b4-9f66-658ed62201dd	5	Five stars for Timothy Chalamet's performance and the interior design set decoration.
/m/a_rainy_day_in_new_york	bfd1d359-c27f-32b4-9f66-658ed62201dd	2	This is not my cup of tea
/m/last_call_2020	903cbb91-7570-4911-82ff-8d90476553e2	3.5	Sarah Booth and Daved Wilkins are names you've likely never heard of.  Last Call has been the name of so many movies, and this one in particular may be the least heard of them all.  It makes for a fascinating film shown in split screen with two shots simultaneously.  There are two people who never meet but are in view for essentially the entire runtime.  Once these two connect we have tension and depending on your level of apathy, a rather cerebral film.  Final Score: 7.4/10
/m/last_call_2020	903cbb91-7570-4911-82ff-8d90476553e2	5	I rented this film and in retrospect I wished I had bought it.  This film kind of broke my heart. In the time of Covid I think we are all very involved with making ourselves happy and maybe not considering the happiness of friends that may be going through a tough time like the characters in this film.  Yes this film is about suicide but it's not done in a preachy way....it's done in a very organic creative way that is heavy but not too heavy and really dramatic in a good way.  Like in a break out Oscar Indie performance way that might have broken out bigger like a Winter's Bone if it had a bigger budget. I think many of the people associated with this film will be doing bigger things in the future. 5 god d*m* heartbreaking stars. (They won't let me put the expletive)
/m/last_call_2020	903cbb91-7570-4911-82ff-8d90476553e2	5	At a time where movies are so predictable, this movie breaks that barrier with this amazing continuous shot with a split screen. Your eyes can't stay off the screen because it's so gripping and poignant. Sarah Booth brings an emotional intensity that is so raw it's beautiful (but also painful) because she makes you feel every moment and every word she says. What a refreshing take on filming with a very real message that doesn't placate to the audience but just lays out a real and authentic story.
/m/jungleland	80118c0e-b556-4ca9-af72-941e13b84d0d	2.5	there is a lot of stuff going on in this movie but i feel that it almost entirely lacks style or character and i was unsure what the point was supposed to be. it has acceptable aesthetics and some decent acting but it was extremely boring and i had zero investment in any of the characters. it lacks action and is supposed to be a drama but it's not really nuanced enough to get any feels out of me.
/m/jungleland	80118c0e-b556-4ca9-af72-941e13b84d0d	5	An amazing film with incredible performances, a compelling story and beautiful cinematography. Not sure why this film didn’t resonate with critics and audiences. In my mind it’s a must-see masterpiece.
/m/jungleland	80118c0e-b556-4ca9-af72-941e13b84d0d	3	6.3/10 — "Okay"/"Watchable"  -(Seen on 7/3/21)
/m/jungleland	80118c0e-b556-4ca9-af72-941e13b84d0d	5	It was so emotional and I loved the brothers story
/m/jungleland	80118c0e-b556-4ca9-af72-941e13b84d0d	4	Good movie full of twists turns.  Keeps ya interested.
/m/jungleland	80118c0e-b556-4ca9-af72-941e13b84d0d	2.5	There is a lot worse movies but there is a lot better bleak but well acted
/m/jungleland	80118c0e-b556-4ca9-af72-941e13b84d0d	3.5	Hunnam is great!  Sad movie,  I think it's a better movie than its scores,but I think movies that leave you melancholy don't get as high scores as they likely deserve.
/m/jungleland	80118c0e-b556-4ca9-af72-941e13b84d0d	3	Hunnam and O'Connell's brawny performances help balancing its poignant theme with thoughtful times. But sadly left viewers floating and the end.
/m/jungleland	80118c0e-b556-4ca9-af72-941e13b84d0d	4.5	I'm old. I'm not good with names. The kid who played the fighter, super. I believed him. The screwed up brother's performance just ok. Compelling story, well acted, script is fair. Overall, enjoyed it. You probably need to enjoy fighting/bk boxing to enjoy this movie.
/m/jungleland	80118c0e-b556-4ca9-af72-941e13b84d0d	3	A wrentching heartfelt story that unfortunately unfolds in too many directions and characters journey to be fully satisfying through its short runtime. That a pity because the cast is great and giving it all but at the same time there's not enough boxing, not enough relationship building and strong bonding out of screen perspective. Could have gone into deeper exploration to obtain most powerful emotional reactions. But still pretty enjoyable and well directed.
/m/song_lang	9fdefdca-c5a4-3043-a595-26fa10fbf357	5	It's a well made, emotional movie. The Cai Luong opera culture of Southern Vietnam after 1975 was well portrayed. But I feel like it could have used a different ending, a lighter one. It would have make it stand out of many LGBTQ dramas. Still a great movie though. 5/5.
/m/the_craft_legacy	3c88e818-0596-39e8-b113-25581f5313f3	2	The overall film was very slow. The story and dialogue was very repetitive and wasn't interested in the Millennial sex concepts. The girls didn't have any character development. They were flat. The Craft film focused on each of the women's personalities and stuck with the tradition of Witchcraft but didn't have the new film's exaggeration.  Legacy gave us a cliffhanger for Nancy's return. I would love for the third film to honor the entire first film and bring back the original cast. They can use the same technique like the guys who started the Cobra Kai series.
/m/the_craft_legacy	3c88e818-0596-39e8-b113-25581f5313f3	1	What could have been a neat, 2020 version of the craft turns into a weird, nonsensical mish mash that doesn’t say, do or entertain much, wastes some talented thespians, and mostly just confuses the audience with why they should care about much of anything.
/m/the_craft_legacy	3c88e818-0596-39e8-b113-25581f5313f3	2	A woke sequel that is also somehow a remake, but just badly done.
/m/the_craft_legacy	3c88e818-0596-39e8-b113-25581f5313f3	3	This movie is certainly not for the generation of the first one! The actual feminisim theme, the acting, and some parts of the story are pretty cool; but the way it transforms into a 00's CW channel show, it's a big nope for me! . 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
/m/the_craft_legacy	3c88e818-0596-39e8-b113-25581f5313f3	0.5	This was embarrassingly awful.
/m/the_craft_legacy	3c88e818-0596-39e8-b113-25581f5313f3	1	Dissapointing predicable weak story bad acting and was just bad sorry but was.
/m/the_craft_legacy	3c88e818-0596-39e8-b113-25581f5313f3	0.5	This movie is not able to delight fans of the original. I believe it is not capable of delighting the general public. It's empty, without enchanters and witches that have nothing of witchcraft or interesting discussions
/m/the_craft_legacy	3c88e818-0596-39e8-b113-25581f5313f3	5	I found this move a good follow up to the original movie. I found it was a great diverse cast and visually a colourful movie. Though its like a lighter version to the first movie, I feel like they have made a story to continue on with and could possibly go further the story in future sequels, granted I feel they would need to go back to the mood and ambiance and tone of the first movie.
/m/the_craft_legacy	3c88e818-0596-39e8-b113-25581f5313f3	4.5	I loved the original movie and this was an excellent sequel with a good story in fitting with the original. I would love to see a third in the series.
/m/the_craft_legacy	3c88e818-0596-39e8-b113-25581f5313f3	2.5	A new twist on the Craft movie but this time around it was fun and not too scary like the first one!!, however while not as Magical as The Craft,  its still a good look at relationships.
/m/spell_2020	410dc9fc-34cc-3a7c-aca5-ee6ae52cd6f8	3.5	Woah, it's a good one! It kept my attention and kept me wondering.
/m/spell_2020	410dc9fc-34cc-3a7c-aca5-ee6ae52cd6f8	1	I was looking forward to watching a horror movie about the area I'm from and was grossly disappointed. KY is not part of the Appalachians. Also, no one from the Appalachia area pronounces it "Appalasha." In fact, that is the first giveaway that you are NOT from the area. One other thing - go much deeper south for voodoo.
/m/spell_2020	410dc9fc-34cc-3a7c-aca5-ee6ae52cd6f8	5	This is what Get Out could have been, immensely better in everyway including the lead actor Omari. Shame how its not getting the same treatment.
/m/spell_2020	410dc9fc-34cc-3a7c-aca5-ee6ae52cd6f8	3	7/10 DO NOT WATCH ALONE
/m/spell_2020	410dc9fc-34cc-3a7c-aca5-ee6ae52cd6f8	3.5	It wasn't as predictable as I thought it was going to be. It kept a sense of thrill and mystery while keeping you in suspense. There were some rather graphic scenes so I wouldn't recommend squeamish people watch this movie. It was an interesting spin on a rather classic story line. I would watch it again.
/m/spell_2020	410dc9fc-34cc-3a7c-aca5-ee6ae52cd6f8	3.5	I was on the edge of my seat during this African-American gothic where the theme of becoming like your enemy to survive fuels the action. Rather like The Craft, the film does not reward do-gooders but the one who uses anger and power to fight evil. Great performances and a good, creepy story.
/m/spell_2020	410dc9fc-34cc-3a7c-aca5-ee6ae52cd6f8	3.5	The pacing and acting are problematic at times, and there is quite a bit of reliance on references to stereotypical Appalachian culture. However, this film holds the attention of the viewer and provides a decent amount of suspense. One particular moment will cause the viewer to intensely recoil, guaranteed.
/m/spell_2020	410dc9fc-34cc-3a7c-aca5-ee6ae52cd6f8	1	You'd think when they were making this movie someone would notice that it's suppose to look like West Virginia in the scenery…. But no, it's like they drove out to Palm Springs with a 5,000$ budget to film this…. Its a stereotypical plot about dumb Appalachian hillbillies (in the desert) that are into Hoodoo magic (which is an African ritual found in South Carolina\louisiana). If you get past all that, then it's just boring. Maybe put it on if you've got nothing else going on
/m/spell_2020	410dc9fc-34cc-3a7c-aca5-ee6ae52cd6f8	0.5	I have to admit my personal bias: I enjoy horror flicks full of surprises, but I detest watching someone being imprisoned and tortured. I've loved Loretta Devine ever since "Boston Public," but in this slow-paced low budget horror, I wish the roof had fallen in on her an hour earlier.
/m/spell_2020	410dc9fc-34cc-3a7c-aca5-ee6ae52cd6f8	3.5	A creepy fun thriller.
/m/dating_amber	e019c0cd-e8e7-470c-8a6b-5ac46db49241	4.5	Dating Amber is an upbeat throwback to an era with a true underground  (punk rock, zines, purple hair) and a dark mainstream (rampant and openly acceptable homophobia and misogyny).  Amber embraces the former and is willing to accept she is attracted to women. Meanwhile, societal pressures of manhood and Eddie's own guilt and fear  essentially send Eddie into a painful denial. The two decide to date, which, for Amber provides a chance to bide her time until she can escape to her punk rock underworld. But, for Eddie, it's a chance to actually become society's definition of normal. Needless to say, there are some bumps on this road. But the duo's journey to self actualization is humbling and in fact quite appropriate for today's audiences.
/m/dating_amber	e019c0cd-e8e7-470c-8a6b-5ac46db49241	3.5	Good coming of age movie. I like how the focus leans more towards the internal battle of acceptance / coming out rather than external struggles.
/m/dating_amber	e019c0cd-e8e7-470c-8a6b-5ac46db49241	5	Everyone deserves an Amber in their lives... Hell, we should all BE Amber. And I love how teenagers are actually ugly in this movies, makes it more relatable.
/m/dating_amber	e019c0cd-e8e7-470c-8a6b-5ac46db49241	5	Loved it, such a sweet movie.
/m/dating_amber	e019c0cd-e8e7-470c-8a6b-5ac46db49241	4.5	Definitely one of the best LGBT movie I watched - on point British comedy and the ending will leave you teary eyed
/m/dating_amber	e019c0cd-e8e7-470c-8a6b-5ac46db49241	5	Hilarious queer movies. I laughed right up to the end, there I cried. The acting is amazing.
/m/dating_amber	e019c0cd-e8e7-470c-8a6b-5ac46db49241	5	Being a teenager is hard enough.  Being a gay teenager in a world which largely doesn't accept you for the way God made you is far worse.  "Dating Amber" tells a story of two gay teens who just want to be left alone, and tells it beautifully.
/m/dating_amber	e019c0cd-e8e7-470c-8a6b-5ac46db49241	4	Fionn O'Shea and Lola Petticrew have a fantastic chemistry in a film with a lot of heart and charm.  David Freyne wrote and directed this semi autobiographical feature that gets growing up different than the cultural norms.  There are enough laughs here to keep ya going through the slow parts.  Hubby: 7.0 Wife: 8.2 Average 7.6/10
/m/dating_amber	e019c0cd-e8e7-470c-8a6b-5ac46db49241	5	So unexpected. Such a good one. Thoroughly enjoyed this. Some great performances and funny/poignant. Rang very true.
/m/dating_amber	e019c0cd-e8e7-470c-8a6b-5ac46db49241	5	What a lovely film. The two central leads were just brilliant, pitch perfect.
/m/represent_2020	bf716600-fa54-4c4d-aea1-219ec6f4b17b	2.5	When 'Knock Down the House' was released last year it was a great look at what can be accomplished against the grain.  This film falls far short of that (perhaps not for trolls), but it is fine.  The director can't find subjects that have charisma or the ability to communicate a message which may be intentional, but it makes the film just sit there.  I couldn't figure out any reason to root for any of these three women, but I admire their courage.  The movie just seems forced.  It's not revolutionary and mostly forgettable, but it's in focus and that's always a plus.  As a fan of documentary films, we are lucky there are so many with distinct and illustrative points of view.  This isn't one that I'll remember.  Final Score: 5/10
/m/mortal_2020	2891e1cc-25e2-30ab-9ce6-f96fa3cbcf8c	2	Meh sums it up. Interesting plot but not very well written. The two main characters go from complete strangers to inseparable lovers within a span of like 7 hours. And even though overall the story is really enjoyable the ending is absolutely trash. No wrap up, no concluded plotlines, just a random cut to credits during what should have been a really intense scene. The only thing that made this movie tolerable is how handsome and charmingly sad the main character is.
/m/mortal_2020	2891e1cc-25e2-30ab-9ce6-f96fa3cbcf8c	5	There was a slow build before I was able to get into the movie, but it was well worth it. The mythology aspect was great, the love story was excellent, and the bad guys were Americans, as in real life (I'm an American, don't worry).
/m/mortal_2020	2891e1cc-25e2-30ab-9ce6-f96fa3cbcf8c	2.5	OK interesting premise, although why Thor is an American I have no idea.  Some of the effects and scenes are interesting.  Thor himself seemed rather bland and ineffectual, and mostly grunted and growled.  The girlfriend thing at least gave him motivation. On the down side, there were a ton of scenes where I was like 'huh'?  Why not just shoot him?  Or, why are you letting him go down the well to the scary chest by himself if you don't trust him, etc etc
/m/mortal_2020	2891e1cc-25e2-30ab-9ce6-f96fa3cbcf8c	4.5	This movie is so UNDERRATED  I thought it was great, from the pacing to the original idea. There was some room for improvement and a huge opening for a sequal(I for one have showered the internet for info on). My favorite part however, weird to some was the pace ofconversation, there weren't useless lines added all over, the story was all that was focused on.
/m/mortal_2020	2891e1cc-25e2-30ab-9ce6-f96fa3cbcf8c	3	A very different kind of approach to the Thor saga. Very interesting with an amazing unexpected ending. Really worth giving a try.
/m/mortal_2020	2891e1cc-25e2-30ab-9ce6-f96fa3cbcf8c	4	If you want actual lore and sit and til the end it's not bad. The actual mythology they follow is really really close to accurate. Acting isn't the worst but there was room for improvement. I've watched it three times and I'm able to dissect even more every time
/m/mortal_2020	2891e1cc-25e2-30ab-9ce6-f96fa3cbcf8c	5	I went into this movie with zero expectations. It was just recommended on Amazon Prime. It turned out to be a hidden gem to say the least. Norway as always is a magnificent country filled with breath taking landscapes. The visual effects for their budget are quite impressive and fit perfectly into every scene. Weather effects can always come off as cheesy or muddled, but they did a great job with what they had. The characters (cast?) needed to be worked out a little better, the interactions felt forced or questionable at bests. The whole lore and overall interpretation of mythology in general in a modern day setting is what really made this movie worth watching until the end. It hooks you and you just can't stop until you see where it is going. The ending they chose fits perfectly with the overall movie and leaves you wanting more! I hope we get more!
/m/mortal_2020	2891e1cc-25e2-30ab-9ce6-f96fa3cbcf8c	5	This film was incredible. It is a million times better than Thor Ragnorak. I am loving these modern interpretations of Norse Mythology. In this case, it feels like a continuation of the mythology. I hope there is a sequel, because it feels like protagonist's journey is far from over.
/m/mortal_2020	2891e1cc-25e2-30ab-9ce6-f96fa3cbcf8c	4	the movie was easy to fallow and had a great ride to it. Glad to see Norse back where it belongs!
/m/mortal_2020	2891e1cc-25e2-30ab-9ce6-f96fa3cbcf8c	5	Well written, great character development, the story is slow for an action movie but, it is clearly building towards much more. This is a genuinely good film. They need to look at the streaming numbers and re-release with some marketing money. I think this could lead to a departure from the typical techno-action thrillers of recent days in a much needed way. Different, beautiful and leaves me wanting more.
/m/kindred_2020	a8356cb2-86af-3c3b-b3a4-c7dd43091d18	2.5	Be careful who you have a baby with - their family might be crazy. And this film could've been a trip - but it failed to deliver on conveying real fear and captivity on the part of the protagonist.
/m/kindred_2020	a8356cb2-86af-3c3b-b3a4-c7dd43091d18	4.5	Yes, true, a re-imagining of "Rosemary's Baby", set in Ireland with a fabulous/creepy/massive Country House (instead of New York's "Dakota") with locked doors and acres (with burial grounds!) surrounded by locked fences! Red herrings galore taking you down all the wrong paths! Or NOT? A fantastic climax with scream-filled scenes that crept into your own nightmares. GREAT cast: Fiona Shaw slays as a wicked semi-mother-in-law, Tamara Lawrence is perfect as a pregnant and trapped young lady. A lady friend, played to perfection by Chloe Pirrie rounds out this Fearsome Female-Led FunHorrorFest! This movie does owe much to "Rosemary's Baby" and isn't THAT GREAT (hence I can't give this a full 5 stars) but oh how I enjoyed "Kindred."
/m/kindred_2020	a8356cb2-86af-3c3b-b3a4-c7dd43091d18	5	Great convincing performance
/m/kindred_2020	a8356cb2-86af-3c3b-b3a4-c7dd43091d18	2	Despite a strong cast, delivering good performances, this is a dreadful patchwork of an awful lot of tropes already done, and done better.
/m/kindred_2020	a8356cb2-86af-3c3b-b3a4-c7dd43091d18	0.5	An hour and a half of my life that I'm never getting back. Genuinely awful in every way.
/m/kindred_2020	a8356cb2-86af-3c3b-b3a4-c7dd43091d18	0.5	Horrible ending to an interesting movie.
/m/kindred_2020	a8356cb2-86af-3c3b-b3a4-c7dd43091d18	5	The ending is not satisfying but it doesn't negate the whole purpose of the movie. The acting is pretty great and really shows a new mother's struggles within the healthcare system.
/m/kindred_2020	a8356cb2-86af-3c3b-b3a4-c7dd43091d18	1	This was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Smh.. I'm actually speechless at how terrible this movie was. Watching this just left me feeling like I made such a poor decision.
/m/kindred_2020	a8356cb2-86af-3c3b-b3a4-c7dd43091d18	4	Downton Abbey meets Rosemary's Baby in this horror that rages through aged locked doors when a pregnant woman is trapped with a white upper class country family after her boyfriend is killed. The quiet simplistic nature is a stillness that haunts this movie over traditional gore and supernatural haunts. The ghosts are the white family when a black woman is imprisoned with her boyfriends family with a soon to be newborn; still grieving the loss of her lover.
/m/kindred_2020	a8356cb2-86af-3c3b-b3a4-c7dd43091d18	3	A new psychological horror. Plagued by mysterious hallucinations, a pregnant woman suspects that the family of her deceased boyfriend has intentions for her unborn child. From the synopsis, I expected this movie to be the Am-I-crazy-or-am-I-not kind of movie. And I was not wrong. The plot of this movie was very derivative of movies of the same types, like Rosemary's Baby. However, the acting, cinematography, and execution were very good. Also, the main actress was African American while the others were all white, which gave the movie a Get Out vibe. However, the movie seemed not to focus on this aspect at all, and only on the psychological part. Also, even though the trailer made the movie like a horror, the movie itself wasn't scary at all. Overall, a well-executed psychological thriller with a plot that was done a lot before. 7/10
/m/the_dark_and_the_wicked	ff53dbb0-6044-4b7b-851c-b735831258dd	4	si quieres pasar un buen susto con una atmosfera de mucho misterio y suspenso, esta es la pelicula que debes ver
/m/the_dark_and_the_wicked	ff53dbb0-6044-4b7b-851c-b735831258dd	5	This movie is way better than 90% of the garbage that hits the big screen. This is a slow burn that builds tension throughout the entire movie. The atmosphere this movie provides is naturally unsettling and not a lot feels forced. There are a few dumb moments of jump scares but for the most part, I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to almost anyone and everyone.
/m/the_dark_and_the_wicked	ff53dbb0-6044-4b7b-851c-b735831258dd	3.5	Fully with the creepiest scenes in the genre within a blank history, the scary feelings succeed beyond the end. 7/10
/m/the_dark_and_the_wicked	ff53dbb0-6044-4b7b-851c-b735831258dd	5	Absolute must watch film will keep you on edge and packs a few scares along the way!
/m/the_dark_and_the_wicked	ff53dbb0-6044-4b7b-851c-b735831258dd	4.5	A story about where to draw the line in child's duty to their parents, when nearing the end of their lives. One of the best horror movies of the last decade. It's as unsettling as it is visceral. The performances give you a feeling of relatability.
/m/the_dark_and_the_wicked	ff53dbb0-6044-4b7b-851c-b735831258dd	2.5	The Dark and The Wicked came with a strong premise, but like so many others in the genre falls short. It's a creepy slow mover that succeeds in leaving a sense of dread. It's certainly dark, but not wicked.
/m/the_dark_and_the_wicked	ff53dbb0-6044-4b7b-851c-b735831258dd	1.5	Effective tension building, framing, and jump scares? Yup. Coherent narrative, lore, meaning, depth, literally anything besides trying to upset Christian egos? Nah.
/m/the_dark_and_the_wicked	ff53dbb0-6044-4b7b-851c-b735831258dd	5	One of the best horror films I've seen in years. So weird and creepy. Loved it. Watched it twice. Very disturbing.  Wish there were more like this.
/m/the_dark_and_the_wicked	ff53dbb0-6044-4b7b-851c-b735831258dd	3.5	E um bom filme de terror mas não e espetacular,porém tem bons momentos de tensão e alguns momentos realmente  e fortes
/m/the_dark_and_the_wicked	ff53dbb0-6044-4b7b-851c-b735831258dd	4	Intense, uneasy, smart, scary!
/m/triggered_2020	22b9c476-0605-3d87-aa8a-02d227757478	2	A collective of douchebags get together in the woods to party, they awaken with suicide vests attached to each of them with different countdown timers and discover that they gain more time if they kill someone else.  The idea of this even though ludicrous is entertaining enough and would have worked better if any of the characters were the least bit likeable.  None were so interest quickly waned.
/m/triggered_2020	22b9c476-0605-3d87-aa8a-02d227757478	2	ahhh this was just okay... i wouldn't recommend & i don't care to ever watch it again. i'd suggest watching Hunger Games instead.
/m/triggered_2020	22b9c476-0605-3d87-aa8a-02d227757478	2	A movie with a interesting premise, but is held down by its lack of wit, jokes that seem to rely too much on irony instead of actually being funny, and character background so unreceiving that you'll just call them Boy 1, 2, 3, etc. and Girl 1, 2, 3, etc.
/m/triggered_2020	22b9c476-0605-3d87-aa8a-02d227757478	0.5	There is not one redeeming quality for this film. Laughably bad acting and dialogue.
/m/triggered_2020	22b9c476-0605-3d87-aa8a-02d227757478	1	What an obnoxious lot. I couldn't make it past the first 15 minutes because of all the yelling. Way over the top. Every character was yelling to the top of their lungs at each other. Nails on a chalk board.
/m/triggered_2020	22b9c476-0605-3d87-aa8a-02d227757478	5	For a lower budget movie this was extremely entertaining. Moved at a good pace especially after the 1st 15 minutes. Plus the kill scene's were well done. Definitely would give this film a shot.
/m/triggered_2020	22b9c476-0605-3d87-aa8a-02d227757478	1	A group of obnoxious twentysomethings are knocked out in the woods and wake up with suicide bombs strapped to their chests that have timers on them... and they can steal their friends time by killing them. The acting is awful, the dialogue ridiculous and it's basically a grade Z "Saw" rip-off but it's still kinda entertaining as these things go... Still I'll only give it one star cause it's a pretty bad movie.
/m/triggered_2020	22b9c476-0605-3d87-aa8a-02d227757478	1.5	The acting was absolutely awful but I liked the concept kinda 1.7. It just kept getting more and more outlandish and ridiculous. Killing a kid over a 0.1 gpa is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard
/m/triggered_2020	22b9c476-0605-3d87-aa8a-02d227757478	1.5	What a waste of an interesting premise that ends up with characters running around and yelling poorly written drama at each others. Not so bad lighting wise but too late i am already playing with my phone disconnected from the plot.
/m/triggered_2020	22b9c476-0605-3d87-aa8a-02d227757478	0.5	This was AWFUL.  About a half-dozen teenage "actors" just screaming and swearing for two hours, with little to no silence.  If you want people to watch a movie, at least make the main characters likeable.  Everything feels disjointed,  I felt no connection to anyone in this movie, this was not hammed up, it was a cold, disgusting 10lbs brick of Spam.
/m/the_dark_divide	08e1e637-45e0-33bd-a3c5-c3c558292787	3.5	Subtly captivating and generally fun despite a slow pace.  David Cross is himself with a long beard and your enjoyment of this film will largely depend on if you enjoy the comedic acting talents of Cross.  Tom Putnam, who wrote and directed, gives it a documentary feel, but still makes you feel like you're watching a movie.  What's incredible is this bizarre tale is based on a true story.  It was quite entertaining and never dull!  Final Score: 7.2/10
/m/the_dark_divide	08e1e637-45e0-33bd-a3c5-c3c558292787	4	Moving honest and Beautiful. Hoping a lot more people see this movie. Well done
/m/the_dark_divide	08e1e637-45e0-33bd-a3c5-c3c558292787	1.5	I was looking forward to this one, and while the scenery is lovely, that's about it. The writing and editing were not very good. Seemed like an inexperienced filmmaker here.
/m/the_dark_divide	08e1e637-45e0-33bd-a3c5-c3c558292787	5	Great movie with a great story.  Bridges the gap between science and the unknown in a comedic fashion.
/m/the_dark_divide	08e1e637-45e0-33bd-a3c5-c3c558292787	1.5	I really wanted to like this, especially since I had spent a glorious few weeks in the mountains of Washington State during this Summer of Covid-19. There is a lot of potential for a wonderful movie and the setting (Gifford Pinchot National Forest) couldn't' be better. But the movie is a mess. There are aspects of the plot that are woefully under-developed, such as the protagonist's relationship with his wife and also the back story about the Spotted Owls and the logging industry in the PNW. Also, there are parts where you realize that there was no editing process at all, like the scene where they are sitting around a campfire and this story goes on and on for far too long about Bigfoot". Really? Aren't there any other Native American legends or stories to feature? Furthermore, there is no "aha" moment where you see the protagonist reach some deep understanding. That is unfortunate. My advice-don't waste your time. Read or watch "Wild" by Cheryl Strayed instead.
/m/the_dark_divide	08e1e637-45e0-33bd-a3c5-c3c558292787	5	This movie is worth watching for the picture alone! Beautiful shots and creative camera work keep the film moving along on this patient expedition of love and loss. The music layers perfectly with The Avett Brothers and the lovely Samantha Crain. 👍🏻👍🏻
/m/the_dark_divide	08e1e637-45e0-33bd-a3c5-c3c558292787	4.5	This movie is worth watching for the picture alone! Beautiful shots and creative camera work keep the film moving along on this patient expedition of love and loss.
/m/the_dark_divide	08e1e637-45e0-33bd-a3c5-c3c558292787	5	Loved it. Great performance and scenery.
/m/the_dark_divide	08e1e637-45e0-33bd-a3c5-c3c558292787	3	It requires you to sit slowly. To take it all in. But, if you do you will be rewarded. It is beautiful.
/m/the_dark_divide	08e1e637-45e0-33bd-a3c5-c3c558292787	4	When a lepidopterist who's an expert in his field doesn't personally know what it's like to go through the kind of transformation that all of his butterfly subjects experience, he sets out on a wilderness journey that provides him with that very metamorphosis. Filmmaker Tom Putnam's fact-based story about the odyssey of Dr. Robert Pyle through one of the remotest wildlife areas in the country tells a tale encompassing a range of emotions, from laughter to tears to revelation, a picture highly reminiscent of films like director Jean-Marc Vallee's "Wild" (2014). Though somewhat episodic at times, the overall narrative rings true to its mission and does so with beautiful cinematography, fine performances and an excellent score. When we all need to get on with our lives, stories like this give us a template to draw from so that we may all take flight.
/m/harry_chapin_when_in_doubt_do_something	c3e6875b-f93d-3134-aac0-5ab06a6b7df2	4.5	An inspirational and well-made film that captures the life, music and lyrics of a guy who was donating his time, talent and treasure to the other guy long before it was trendy. History teachers will appreciate its unbiased accuracy and social science teachers should show it. Bruce Springsteen's testimony of Harry's impact is priceless. And whenever the likes of Billy Joel, Pat Benatar, DMC and others are singing someone's praises as a musician and as a person, his story is worth watching. Harry was certainly done too soon.
/m/harry_chapin_when_in_doubt_do_something	c3e6875b-f93d-3134-aac0-5ab06a6b7df2	5	This documentary has really captured the true essence of who Harry Chapin was and how his philanthropy and humanitarian works still live on through his family and many fans. He was an amazing singer/songwriter and left this world way too soon. Harry had so much energy and didn't waste any time. He put all that energy into World Hunger and his songs and fans. I'm so glad that Rick Korn, director and Harry's son Jason Chapin, producer, got this done. You can tell it's a real labor of love.
/m/harry_chapin_when_in_doubt_do_something	c3e6875b-f93d-3134-aac0-5ab06a6b7df2	5	An excellent documentary on the life of music and activism of Harry CHAPIN.  A lot of videos of his music and those surrounding his life his family and friend.
/m/harry_chapin_when_in_doubt_do_something	c3e6875b-f93d-3134-aac0-5ab06a6b7df2	4.5	Interesting and intriguing. Worth the trip
/m/harry_chapin_when_in_doubt_do_something	c3e6875b-f93d-3134-aac0-5ab06a6b7df2	5	Full of surprise musicians explaining the importance of Harry in their lives.
/m/where_she_lies	64f9d2f3-c846-4830-93b9-66ef4abfd148	0.5	Don’t waste your time watching. It’s the story of a delusional woman.
/m/greatland	cc899839-4f9e-4cfa-b691-3ef62810b0b6	4.5	Greatland is a super trippy, really fun ride. It's got a very DIY quality to the production, but that makes it all the better. Definitely watch if you're into sci-fi.
/m/greatland	cc899839-4f9e-4cfa-b691-3ef62810b0b6	4	Greatland is very original and unlike anything else. I think the strongest aspect of the film is actually the production design. The detail in every scene is impressive. The main actors did well. And some of the filming locations were impressive also.
/m/greatland	cc899839-4f9e-4cfa-b691-3ef62810b0b6	4	Well done!! Interesting and shot well!
/m/greatland	cc899839-4f9e-4cfa-b691-3ef62810b0b6	5	This movie is Out of this World for sure in the best ways! Very colorful cast and fun fantasy story line made this an entertaining watch for me. Ulysses character did a great job bringing real emotion to the screen. I appreciate films that can take me somewhere... and this one did just that.
/m/greatland	cc899839-4f9e-4cfa-b691-3ef62810b0b6	5	Futurist films like "Greatland" are at their best when they help us understand our society by holding a mirror up to it. This film takes it a step further by asking you to look in the mirror through a kaleidoscope lit by a black light. It's visually wild and frighteningly thought provoking. Some themes addressed in the film already seem to be coming to pass in 2021. Also, I was delighted to see Eric Roberts make an appearance ... his performance was stellar as always.
/m/greatland	cc899839-4f9e-4cfa-b691-3ef62810b0b6	4	On the day of his birthday, Ulysses must endure the Dark Temple ceremony in a utopia of diversity, tolerance, and inclusiveness. Of course, not is all that it seems as a deadly virus infects the love of his childhood. What will he do? You will have to check out this original and strange movie to find out.   One of my favorite aspects of the film is the immersive world. It's a character on its own. The lead actors Arman Darbo and (I think) Camille Curtis is excellent. Well done.
/m/greatland	cc899839-4f9e-4cfa-b691-3ef62810b0b6	5	Greatland fun ambitious Indie Sci-Fi movie about a mischievous group of misfit teens that has to over come a disease outbreak while an election is under way.  The production value is great and the color schemes choices are easy on the eyes.
/m/greatland	cc899839-4f9e-4cfa-b691-3ef62810b0b6	4.5	Not your average teen dystopian drama, this one conveys a world that feels original and extreme, yet relevant.  The usual dystopian tropes are here—authoritarianism, heavy-handed control and surveillance, censorship, class divide, forbidden love—but they are captured in unique and sometimes wacky ways, which make this film fresh.  And yet the film seems a very fitting commentary on today's society and the direction we are going.  The film is a visual feast and an entertaining adventure story that will keep you engaged.
/m/greatland	cc899839-4f9e-4cfa-b691-3ef62810b0b6	4	This movie is bonkers! Like Pee-wee's Playhouse meets Terry Gilliam's Brazil. If it were a bit more deadpan and raunchier, it would be right at home in the Adult Swim catalogue. Though it seems influenced by various dystopian/ sci fi movies, this has a palette and style of its own that I have never quite seen before. Its low budget is utilized very effectively in its ambitious world-building and mix of CGI and practical effects. If you're in the mood for something wild and flashy, and a critique of "woke" culture, then this is for you.
/m/greatland	cc899839-4f9e-4cfa-b691-3ef62810b0b6	4	Really interesting film especially if you're looking for something different than the hollywood norm. The filmmakers take some chances and that's something I always appreciate. Strap in for a feast of color and style.
/m/cup_of_cheer	9c81d6b3-5e36-408d-b46f-4f72882bd068	1	Not worth your time. I kept thinking it was going to be better
/m/cup_of_cheer	9c81d6b3-5e36-408d-b46f-4f72882bd068	4	Airplane meets Hallmark Christmas movie. Lots of great laughs and weird stuff going on. We really enjoyed it.
/m/cup_of_cheer	9c81d6b3-5e36-408d-b46f-4f72882bd068	5	Really different to your usual cheesy Christmas movie. So funny, laughs all the way through!
/m/cup_of_cheer	9c81d6b3-5e36-408d-b46f-4f72882bd068	5	So cool to stumble on this movie not knowing what to expect only to be blown away. I couldn't stop laughing for an hour and a half. It's very silly and off the wall for sure, but if you think it's "stupid" or "childish" you're missing the point - it knows it's stupid, so it's actually genius haha. This is a comedy the likes of which no one seems to make anymore. Like Airplane or Walk Hard. Absolutely going to be adding it to my Christmas watchlist every year.
/m/cup_of_cheer	9c81d6b3-5e36-408d-b46f-4f72882bd068	4	This is the perfect Xmas spoof especially if you don't enjoy the whiney saccharine soaked hallmark movies. This movie is never boring totally zany and whackey.  thanks Canada !
/m/they_reach	c7c4d2f8-1236-3f0d-8aa1-5481c129062e	0.5	The "quirkiness" was way over the top. The father daughter drama made no sense and was extremely forced and unnecessary. I was confused by the behavior of nearly every character but especially the father and the cops.
/m/they_reach	c7c4d2f8-1236-3f0d-8aa1-5481c129062e	2	Incredibly charming, occasionally funny, often messy. Something went wrong with the plot progression midway through. Ends in a ball of fire. But a cute ball of fire.
/m/they_reach	c7c4d2f8-1236-3f0d-8aa1-5481c129062e	4.5	Great fun throw-back 70s horror flick.  Stranger Things, Goonies, ET references. Schwinn Stingrays abound in this shoe-string, jump scare, production. Good fun.  The cold open scene really sets the tone.
/m/they_reach	c7c4d2f8-1236-3f0d-8aa1-5481c129062e	5	For a "no budget" thriller they did a great job Imagine what this group could accomplish with an actual budget! I really liked that the lead was a girl who is smarter than the boys but doesn't try to hide it--In the 70's I was always told to "not let the boys know you are smart" BS. I didn't follow that rule and neither does Jessica!  I loved the character of Cheddar so much and really am excited to see what this young cast does next.
/m/they_reach	c7c4d2f8-1236-3f0d-8aa1-5481c129062e	5	A fun ride! Jump back to the 1970's for a classic friends to the end, good vs evil story led by a marvelous cast of young actors that save the day and possibly all of humanity.
/m/they_reach	c7c4d2f8-1236-3f0d-8aa1-5481c129062e	1.5	86 % from fans on Rotten Tomatoes seriously, this movie is bad even for a multi genre 70/80s ripoff it’s really bad, I sat through 90min of horrible unfunny acting and repetitive kills for an ending that pissed me off back in the 80s trust me it ain’t nearly good enough to pull this Gremlins crap in 2020 please forget this and stream “Slither” instead in the end what happened happened no Efin do overs.
/m/they_reach	c7c4d2f8-1236-3f0d-8aa1-5481c129062e	3	Thoughts on They Reach  Characters – Jessica is the grief filled young teenager that has seen her brother die, she is collecting items which sees her end up releasing an evil into the home, which she must work with her friends to stop, she will face her own demons to make this happen. Sam and Cheddar are the best friends that are looking to support Jessica through the difficult times, with Cheddar getting laughs through the film. The three do have great chemistry together, which drives the story forward.  Performances – Mary Madaline Roe, Morgan Chandler and Eden Campbell are great to watch together, they give us the feeling of true friendship through the whole film, while Mary gets to tackle the solo side of the film required she is just as good.  Story – The story follows a young teenage girl that accidently release an evil into her home and must work with her friends to try and stop it from getting unleashed upon the whole town. The story here does show us a world where someone is grieving in their own way, which is always used to attract the evil into their life, it does have a feeling of a Stranger Things with how the three are trying to solve things, with the parents having their own side story dealing with the events. The story is told in a fun way that can be enjoyed.  Adventure/Horror – The adventure side of this film shows us how the characters will be doing everything to stop the horror they find haunting them throughout the film.  Settings – The film uses the small town setting to show us how the character would be able to work together and shows us how the town knows Jessica and her family's loss.   Scene of the Movie – The first appearance.  That Moment That Annoyed Me – Not keen on certain moments, which will include spoilers.  Final Thoughts – They Reach is a fun adventure horror that will show the characters at their best, working together to fight evil.
/m/they_reach	c7c4d2f8-1236-3f0d-8aa1-5481c129062e	3.5	There are a few directors in horror that just give you this "feeling" after you watch their films. You finish watching, and you notice that the reality of the film was super messed up, but you still feel like you had a great time. It's kind of like getting off a roller coaster. You know it was scary, but the thrill of it made you laugh and scream in delight, and at the end you know you made a great decision. I feel like this when I watch horror movies from Joe Dante, Tobe Hooper, or Peter Jackson, and I felt like this after watching Sylas Dall's They Reach.  They Reach takes place in 1979, and follows Jessica (Mary Madaline Roe), a teenage tomboy who loves to tinker with electronics and other science-y stuff. Jessica recently lost her brother and is trying to bridge the emotional gap forming between her and her dad, who has a hard time accepting Jessica for the grade-A nerd she is. After picking up a box of old junk from a local store, Jessica finds an old reel-to-reel tape player, and in an effort to fix it, cuts herself and bleeds onto the player, releasing the Sangui Demon within. The demon murders anyone in the path to its ultimate goal, possessing the body of the person who released it. Jessica must enlist the help of her two best friends and her dad to defeat the demon in the best way she knows how, with science.  This is Sylas Dall's first feature film for both writing and directing after doing several shorts. The idea is extremely cool. Granted, there are tons of other stories that pieces of this film borrows from, but he changes it just enough to make it feel incredibly unique. Focusing on using the children as the main actors and storytellers gives it the film that welcomed nostalgic vibe from films like Joe Dante's Explorers or Small Soldiers. Having the story revolve around a girl and using it to break from the social norms that girls can't be into nerdy stuff was a great choice. The film is a great example of doing a lot with a little, and sometimes that's all it takes to make something memorable.  The three leads in the film were children, and surprisingly gave better performances than the adults. I'm not sure if that was intentional, being that as the audience, I was happy to see adult after adult get picked off by the demon in true head-exploding fashion. The adult performances in most cases were fine, but some had a hard time pulling through the sometimes-cheesy dialogue. The camera work was also a little spotty, feeling amateur at times, and then switching to well-done shots with fantastic angles and lighting. I'm chalking this up to the budget challenges that come with a first feature. Not everything is going to be amazing, but there was certainly enough to be impressed.  Speaking of budget, most of the gore that happens in this film takes place off-screen, and we're left with the goopy blood spray aftermath that comes from the attacks, but even though this is common in films that don't have huge budgets, this is still extremely effective and fun. There are a few awesome creature makeups that don't look like they rely on CG to make them look more real. One thing that really stuck out was the score from Carlos Garcia. A lot of the story focuses on the emotional connections between Jessica and her family and friends. The music in these segments drew me in and resonated with me, kind of telling me the emotional story through sound right along with me watching it. The soundtrack of various artists was well-picked and suited the film perfectly. I thought the ending was a little predictable, but safe for the type of movie we're being shown.  Overall, I think They Reach will fly under the radar a bit, but I wish it wouldn't. The nostalgia didn't hit as hard as when watching stuff like Stranger Things or Summer of 84, but the coming-of-age focus on the losses, lives and friendships of being a kid were present enough to make me leave the film smiling and thinking about my past. It wasn't a perfect film by any means, but way more on the right track of things than the wrong one, and I'm certainly excited to see more from Sylas Dall. I recommend checking this one out!

/m/they_reach	c7c4d2f8-1236-3f0d-8aa1-5481c129062e	4	Writer/director Sylas Dall infuses the proceedings with equal parts tenderness and tension, and viewers interested solely in giggle-inducing gore may find the opening half hour, with its stridently adolescent conversations about rock bands, school dances and comic books, too purposely slow and sentimental. Yet the character-building serves to enhance what follows, and with all good movies of this ilk, once the malevolent forces break from their acosmic bonds the ride doesn't stop until the heartbreaking, bittersweet end. Amid the jokes and ample bloodshed, They Reach abounds with intimate themes about the bonds of friendship and the lengths a parent will go to protect their children.
/m/they_reach	c7c4d2f8-1236-3f0d-8aa1-5481c129062e	4	Behind the camera, the crew have crafted a beautiful looking period piece and the attention to detail is perfect and not for one second do you not feel as if you are in 1979. Watching the film for a second time, I checked out so many fun details in the backgrounds (and bedrooms) that took me right back to what it was like to live in the late 70s (yes I was there)   But of course the true stars of the films are the cast, and whilst I do love the horror layers in the film, I also love this film for its character moments especially scenes between the 3 ‘younger' actors who play Jessica ( Mary Madaline Roe ), Sam ( Morgan Chandler), and Cheddar ( Eden Campbell) who do an amazing job at playing characters that were around in a time before they were ever born.  Fans of Stranger Things, Stephen Kings It, and JJ Abrams Super 8 and even older films such as Stand By Me, will have a huge grin on their faces when these characters are sharing the screen.  There is so much praise I can lay across this film, from the sound design, the music choices (takes you right back to the time period, which of course is the point, but its still a treat for the ears), to the locations, the props and set design, of course the cast, and the wonderful writing and direction. So treat yourself when you can
/m/the_more_you_ignore_me	b033eae2-d761-3359-a5bb-00b82263930a	5	It's only when you see a movie like this that you realise how feeble and dismal most of the stuff on offer actually is. I guess you could pigeonhole it as a 'heart-warming British comedy' but you'd be selling it short. Mental illness is no joke and the film doesn't shy away from the harsh realities. What makes it bearable is what makes life itself bearable - the ability to see the funny side, our clumsy attempts to look after one another and the joy we can find in simple things. Very few movies these days attempt to portray life as it is lived by ordinary people. This one does. If it occasionally veers into sentimentality it's because that's what real people do. Psychopaths do exist, but if an alien intelligence were to try to understand human life from our movies, they could be forgiven for thinking they were the norm. If what you want from a movie is gun-fights, car chases and two-dimensional heroes, watch something else. If you're hungry for something entertaining watch this.
/m/the_more_you_ignore_me	b033eae2-d761-3359-a5bb-00b82263930a	4.5	Really enjoyed this - weird as it explores mental health.  Sheridan Smith plays the psychotic  Mum. Well written by Jo Brand.
/m/the_more_you_ignore_me	b033eae2-d761-3359-a5bb-00b82263930a	3.5	I had this movie for so long and I could't watch it because of lack of subtitles, hard for me to understand the strong accent and it was worth the wait. I really liked the whole lot. The plot, the acting, realness and the quirkiness.
/m/the_more_you_ignore_me	b033eae2-d761-3359-a5bb-00b82263930a	1.5	A weak story of a mothers mental health problems that directly effects her long suffering family. Its a comedy with nothing to laugh about, more about dysfunction and how they deal with the growing problems. The highlight is music by The Smiths, the low point is everything else.
/m/the_more_you_ignore_me	b033eae2-d761-3359-a5bb-00b82263930a	5	A masterpiece. You should all see it!
/m/the_more_you_ignore_me	b033eae2-d761-3359-a5bb-00b82263930a	2	A few good gags. But not much originality.
/m/the_more_you_ignore_me	b033eae2-d761-3359-a5bb-00b82263930a	5	Loved the story. Relatable if you have family friends with diagnosis. And, it's sweet as all LIVE their unique lives -it unfolds so real and yet creatively at same time.!!!
/m/the_more_you_ignore_me	b033eae2-d761-3359-a5bb-00b82263930a	4	80s & The Smiths!  I'm in.
/m/the_more_you_ignore_me	b033eae2-d761-3359-a5bb-00b82263930a	3.5	Things I did not expect from this film: a complex mother/daughter relationship, many tears, the smiths (always a pleasent surprise,if not a particularly original one), how freakin' tragic this poor girl's life is. Things I did expect: Ella Hunt to be marvellous in it. Bonus points for the amazing 80s outfits.
/m/the_more_you_ignore_me	b033eae2-d761-3359-a5bb-00b82263930a	5	Heartwarming, laugh-out loud funny at times, and deeply emotional at others. Go see!
/m/the_devil_has_a_name	20626a96-c98d-3110-bb38-f3eecba8ecae	2.5	Bosworth is supposedly a brilliant oil goddess that outsmarts a farmer who has had his ground water poisoned.  She navigates the farmer, the illegals, and the oil company to end up sitting head of the table at the end.  The storyline is fractured and the stabs at dark comedy don't really work.
/m/the_devil_has_a_name	20626a96-c98d-3110-bb38-f3eecba8ecae	5	Great movie! I highly recommend it. I would watch this movie again.   Rick Barker

You know what, it's still pretty dull for the non sober also!  You'll see some faces you recognize in a doc that never really comes together about a fake fake cult.  Final Score: 5.6/10
/m/jr_bob_dobbs_and_the_church_of_the_subgenius	7f6d24ae-3c14-3f9c-847e-ff4611a592dd	3.5	Are you a genius, nearly? Have you nothing but disgust for society, except you'd still "like fries with that"? Then come watch this documentary.   Here's the story of 2 off-beat losers and their unfollowers who found a self-consciously satirical cult (centered around Bob, a deity), which gets out of hand and morphs into something akin to an actual cult--oops (:P)   It was cool to see a minor subculture grow organically from the ground up in reaction to the normie counterrevolution of the Reagan Era. Weirdos found each other and formed real connections pre-Internet, at some points almost by chance, cutting and pasting zines, and then sending them off in the mail to who knows?   The movie is also a somewhat dark meditation on what it means to build something truly original, release it into the wild, and then lost control over it. Consequences of good old-fashioned irreverence were at times hilarious, awesome, and messed up. I found interviews with a number of the most Bob-ed of the Bob, including the founders, to be searching and reflective, and even remorseful.   This movie, btw, has satisfied my curiosity about whether we would be better off if society's weirdos were in charge.   In conclusion: GET LOST. This movie ain't for you!!
/m/jr_bob_dobbs_and_the_church_of_the_subgenius	7f6d24ae-3c14-3f9c-847e-ff4611a592dd	5	Praise Bob! 110%!! Also, SRSLY, thanks for this... I may now die happy.
/m/jr_bob_dobbs_and_the_church_of_the_subgenius	7f6d24ae-3c14-3f9c-847e-ff4611a592dd	5	Think for yourself, and don't get caught up in the narratives others spin for you.
/m/the_wall_of_mexico	8d8131c2-8a8c-393f-959b-6f62813ec55c	5	This film get five stars for being so completely unlike any other film. The dialogue is so bizarre but it works. It feels like a play, but then the visuals are very cinematic, so... Rathbone is convincing as a cowboy wannabe. Zumbado makes the film, though, because she plays an original character, truly original and strange, like a crazy crossbreed of a reality TV bombshell hot-gurl type and a Marxian grad student nerd. The film feels like its own little alien planet that doesn't care what people think about it.
/m/the_wall_of_mexico	8d8131c2-8a8c-393f-959b-6f62813ec55c	0.5	The movie was boring and just plain weird.  The theme oversimplified real-world problems to sway the viewer to one outcome.  I saw it more as propaganda went wrong.  I spent a few days thinking about it and trying to find a redeeming quality.  Lastly, this is not a comedy in any sense of the word.
/m/the_place_of_no_words	194e092b-728b-44f0-b3fb-53575fea5096	5	This film was so visually beautiful that you're left thinking hoooooooowwww? And the story... oh the story. A masterpiece from the brilliant mind of director Mark Webber. Get ready to feel some feelings! You'll love it!
/m/sibyl	158dcd5d-d510-33fe-a8ad-5b5a5640ba6c	5	Absurdic from the beginning, but very intense. Become erupted at the end.
/m/sibyl	158dcd5d-d510-33fe-a8ad-5b5a5640ba6c	3.5	Remarkably works as a disjointed black comedy largely by the efforts of Efira is is magnetic despite the many foibles of her character
/m/sibyl	158dcd5d-d510-33fe-a8ad-5b5a5640ba6c	1.5	I got terribly bored. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.
/m/bullets_of_justice	484935dc-993b-41c8-90b4-3a54aa8839db	3.5	Very efficient B-Movie set in an Apocalyptic era, hybrid of action, horror and sci-fi, ridiculously funny, ambitious, well done satire on capitalism, social manipulation and meat eating disorder. Bloody, gut wrenching, scatological, sometimes visually disgusting. Overall a classic for a midnight session with no strings attached. A fun wild ride.
/m/bullets_of_justice	484935dc-993b-41c8-90b4-3a54aa8839db	4	This movie has none stop action, and crazy costumes. I thought Doroteya Toleva's mustache was funny though distracting. and there is an odd side story about male models &  butts. but generally it's turn your brain off fun.
/m/bullets_of_justice	484935dc-993b-41c8-90b4-3a54aa8839db	0.5	The only thing I liked were the fake boobs. The movie had no story or anything at all. It was just a meme but not something that I would recommend to people.
/m/the_mortuary_collection	2e5ec8a2-ee96-3c12-a750-27e83060113d	3	The first two stories are boring and predictable, causing a strong urge to fast forward. The movie gets better after that, but never gets as dark or brutal as it could be.
/m/the_mortuary_collection	2e5ec8a2-ee96-3c12-a750-27e83060113d	4.5	I want a sequel!!!! with less flashing lights!!!!
/m/the_mortuary_collection	2e5ec8a2-ee96-3c12-a750-27e83060113d	5	Great anthology! Fun stories. The wrap around story and twist is awesome
/m/the_mortuary_collection	2e5ec8a2-ee96-3c12-a750-27e83060113d	5	absolutely loved it :)
/m/the_mortuary_collection	2e5ec8a2-ee96-3c12-a750-27e83060113d	3	A workmanlike mashup of previous horror collections with mixed results.
/m/the_mortuary_collection	2e5ec8a2-ee96-3c12-a750-27e83060113d	5	A good show to trail behind two sentence horror stories and creep show
/m/the_mortuary_collection	2e5ec8a2-ee96-3c12-a750-27e83060113d	2	I'm beginning to wonder if the tomato reviewers are getting kick backs to recommend crappy movies these days. This was just so-so. Childish with gore. Dragged.
/m/the_mortuary_collection	2e5ec8a2-ee96-3c12-a750-27e83060113d	3	Anthology films are certainly very hit and miss. This one isn't awful, yet really leaves no lasting impression. There are some nice practical effects and Clancy Brown is solid as ever. However, it's immediately forgettable once the credits roll. 6/10
/m/the_mortuary_collection	2e5ec8a2-ee96-3c12-a750-27e83060113d	5	The reviews are correct. This is enjoyable horror. Would definitely watch again. So damn good!
/m/the_mortuary_collection	2e5ec8a2-ee96-3c12-a750-27e83060113d	2	Weak, by the numbers, seat of your pants, unmemorable, except for what's his name, who's always pretty good, except when he's not.
/m/love_and_monsters	b5c5b8b4-e9ae-3f03-b833-a2bd894a69a2	5	It is one of best and unexpectedly good movie of the year.
/m/love_and_monsters	b5c5b8b4-e9ae-3f03-b833-a2bd894a69a2	3.5	Fun. Not quite a love story. Not quite a scary monster movie. But Love and Monsters is a fun ride with wonderful characters. Dylan O'Brien is a goofy, lovable lead that has you rooting for him from start to finish. And every minute Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt share on screen is pure gold.
/m/love_and_monsters	b5c5b8b4-e9ae-3f03-b833-a2bd894a69a2	4	A delightful Post-apocalyptic horror/fantasy. The lead is just soo affecting in all the fun he is clearly having. It's a rich, fleshed out and colorful world they've put together here. I wouldn't mind visiting again.
/m/love_and_monsters	b5c5b8b4-e9ae-3f03-b833-a2bd894a69a2	4	Farofa crocante demais
/m/love_and_monsters	b5c5b8b4-e9ae-3f03-b833-a2bd894a69a2	4.5	Released amidst the pandemonium of the COVID-19 pandemic, Love and Monsters likely flew under your radar. Its biggest star, Dylan O'Brien, hasn't been seen in a lead Hollywood blockbuster role since the conclusion of the Maze Runner films wrapped in 2018 (and that final film would have been released much earlier had it not been for injuries sustained by O'Brien while filming). With a great supporting cast of characters, and the most adorable canine co-star since Hachi, Love and Monsters is a film worth making time for.  The film begins with a great deal of exposition as to how planet Earth came to be infested with monsters. This bit is narrated by O'Brien, and animated in a way that, once you finish the film, you understand was a fun nod to O'Brien's character, Joel. It is, by far, one of the better explanations you could hope for in movie like this one. A film with this particular premise is easily ruined at the starting line by either no explanation, a ludicrous one, or one with far too much made-up terminology to follow.  We meet Joel, who is living with his colony (a sort of quasi-family that lives underground), after much of the human population is lost. He is a good kid, and though everyone in his colony likes him, he can't contribute much (except his delicious minestrone). After losing radio contact with his love interest, Amy, he decides to risk his life and venture out to the surface; he is determined to traverse the treacherous 85 miles to reunite with her.  Joel himself is likable enough, but for the audience, it takes time to get there. He is not a hero when we first meet him, nor is he much of anything. However, once you eventually realize you like him, you really like him. When the action picks up, you really care about his survival. And when he kills his first monster, you can practically hear applause. We meet our other characters once Joel has wiggled his way into our hearts. Again, I'd rather not give many details away here, but the characters we meet bring so much heart to the story that it becomes clear why the film's title was changed from "Monster Problems" to Love and Monsters. The Love seen throughout the flick is just as much the focal point as the Monsters.  The film takes the hero's journey formula and grounds it against a wild backdrop. Our post-apocalyptic world that Joel re-enters is a visual treat to behold. (No surprise that it was nominated for Best Visual Effects at the 93rd Academy Awards). The land has been reclaimed by nature and, though we know it is full of danger around every corner, you can't help but be mesmerized by its lush foliage and colors. And with monsters (or their traces) visible in the distance or background of certain scenes, the film does with its landscape what The Haunting of Hill House did with its creepy house full of ghosts.  There are some predictable/typical action movie tropes, especially in the third act, but the film executes them, and honestly its entire story, in a way that you can't help but forgive it. We are left at the film's end, with a conclusion that is both warm and meaningful, and it works on its own; but it also leaves plenty of story to tell in the future. This story itself was a rare original sadly lost in the pandemic amongst all the sequels, prequels, remakes, reboots and superheroes. Massive accolades are due for both the film's writer, Brian Duffield, and the film's director, Michael Matthews, who only has one feature film credit and three short films to his name prior to this movie. We can only hope that this creative team will once again band together to continue the story of our monster-riddled Earth.  As a whole, Love and Monsters lives up to its name. It does a superb job at injecting massive doses of heart into a world infested with monsters. Its story, cast, visuals and ending are likely to make this movie a favorite of many, once those many finally get a chance to see it.
/m/love_and_monsters	b5c5b8b4-e9ae-3f03-b833-a2bd894a69a2	3.5	Fun ride! Worth the watch even if there's structurally nothing new here the film absolutely delivers a high energy, beautiful, and well acted escape for its entire 100 plus minute runtime. The CGI team deserves some plaudits for delivering both wild and creative monsters that felt as real and scary or outlandish and comical as the the story required.
/m/love_and_monsters	b5c5b8b4-e9ae-3f03-b833-a2bd894a69a2	3	If you just turn your brain off it's an ok watch...entertaining enough but not a film I'm going to remember tomorrow. Interesting premise but with poor story and uninteresting characters. Not to mention some questionable visual effects. Best part of the film hands down was the dog 'Boy'.
/m/love_and_monsters	b5c5b8b4-e9ae-3f03-b833-a2bd894a69a2	2.5	Dylan O'Brien is definitely a worth watching actor. However, I think he needs to be given greater opportunities than this movie. For me, it had some thrilling scenes, but the most part of the movie was cliched with few to add to the apocalypse genre.
/m/love_and_monsters	b5c5b8b4-e9ae-3f03-b833-a2bd894a69a2	3.5	Nice watch even though it didn't bring anything particularly new to the table. Would watch a sequel.
/m/love_and_monsters	b5c5b8b4-e9ae-3f03-b833-a2bd894a69a2	5	Very entertaining and fun!
/m/shithouse	3e926a18-b667-32e1-96aa-0e7360436987	3.5	Some laughs, probably too much crying, overall enjoyable.
/m/shithouse	3e926a18-b667-32e1-96aa-0e7360436987	5	Such a good movie, the script its amazing, this is the before sunrise of this generation.
/m/shithouse	3e926a18-b667-32e1-96aa-0e7360436987	4	An excellent and unusual coming of age drama which shares more in common with something like Damsels In Distress (2011) rather than American Pie (1999). A homesick freshman who attends a party and spends the night with a girl has a bout of reality of the situation of college life the following day. The night takes up a lot of the film, and the reality and struggles of what follows is the remainder, and it is brilliantly effective. It's a fresh take on the genre, and if you can track it down it is absolutely worth a watch.
/m/shithouse	3e926a18-b667-32e1-96aa-0e7360436987	4	For such a title, it was a warm and feel good comedy.
/m/shithouse	3e926a18-b667-32e1-96aa-0e7360436987	3.5	Tender and quite funny. A late coming-of-age kind of tale.
/m/shithouse	3e926a18-b667-32e1-96aa-0e7360436987	4.5	I loved this movie so much, I am willing to overlook the fact that these people are mostly pushing 30 and playing teenagers.  Newbie filmmaker Cooper Raiff nails everything about college and the individual personalities you encounter along the way.  Raiff gets the best out of Dylan Gelula, who always plays the same character, but here she's nuanced.  It's a charming first feature about the traditional college student.  I'm not sure it connects for a commuter or someone who doesn't travel for college, but this was my wheelhouse.  The film gets people.  It has a certain authenticity that is rarely encapsulated in a movie of this genre.  There's a depth to the characters.  Raiff gets people, at least college-aged people and that makes him a talent to watch!  Final Score: 9/10
/m/shithouse	3e926a18-b667-32e1-96aa-0e7360436987	4	We all love our RA.  A freshman struggling in college befriended his dorm's RA, and they spent the night and learned about each other.   Early on, the movie had a great way of showing how our main character was lonely. Whenever the camera turned to his stuffed animal, there's always subtitles that replied back to our main character. Apparently it was him talking to his friend, the stuffed animal. Another part was that he's a mommy boy. He tried to go to parties, and clearly he was very awkward.   The first half of the story was mostly him on a walk with his RA, and for like 20 minutes it was just them talking. The way they talked was very realistic. It was awkward and had a bunch of repeating words. It just felt like I was watching two real life college students talking, not two actors remembering the script and acting out. This is possible because the two main actors were phenomenal.  Then the conflict happened. Both sides clearly did things wrong, and the movie did not show who's right or wrong. These scenarios definitely could happen in real life. Also, there's no emotional scene where they all made up.   Overall, a realistic and funny slice of life that showed some college students living their lives in college. 8.5/10
/m/shithouse	3e926a18-b667-32e1-96aa-0e7360436987	2	This is why Americans can't relate to anyone not American. They are just a different breed.
/m/shithouse	3e926a18-b667-32e1-96aa-0e7360436987	5	This touching coming of age film offers a fresh take on leaving home, starting college, and finding oneself

/m/after_we_collided	bcbebdf8-e3bd-3835-a0e8-4e1f0e358a9c	2.5	Well, I liked the first movie After, but this second one makes a lot of mistakes. The script is stupid, the first act is full of jokes and there are too many subplots that the director doesn't know how to deal with. Yet the film delivers what the audience wants. (5.5/10)
/m/after_we_collided	bcbebdf8-e3bd-3835-a0e8-4e1f0e358a9c	4	So-called bad movies can also be entertaining and chemistry is part of that. If you liked the fiirst film you should probably love this one. Its Hallmark without the same plot! So it's better.
/m/after_we_collided	bcbebdf8-e3bd-3835-a0e8-4e1f0e358a9c	0.5	After the film my head collided with a wall cause I wanted to bash out the memory of this disastrous film.
/m/after_we_collided	bcbebdf8-e3bd-3835-a0e8-4e1f0e358a9c	3	Better than the first one but still awful. Trevor carried this whole thing
/m/after_we_collided	bcbebdf8-e3bd-3835-a0e8-4e1f0e358a9c	0.5	I came to this movie with no expectations. I was somehow incredibly disappointed. To anyone who saw the 93% fresh score from the fans and had the thought to watch this, please don't. Unless your a massive fifty shaded of grey fan who loves movies about abusive relationships, this will not satisfy you at all. The acting is abysmal, the plot is filled with holes and inconsistencies that are so painfully obvious that you can't even choose to ignore them, and the dialogue is laughably bad. In fact, thats the only positive about this movie. Some sequences are so poorly executed that it's actually quite funny. This is an abomination to film.
/m/after_we_collided	bcbebdf8-e3bd-3835-a0e8-4e1f0e358a9c	0.5	Complete mess. Bad plot and bad acting.

/m/after_we_collided	bcbebdf8-e3bd-3835-a0e8-4e1f0e358a9c	5	Loved the movie …very much a love movie and full of passion
/m/after_we_collided	bcbebdf8-e3bd-3835-a0e8-4e1f0e358a9c	0.5	E' addirittura peggiore del primo. Almeno quest'ultimo faceva ridere a causa dello squallore della sceneggiatura e dei dialoghi. Il secondo invece è assurdamente noioso e con i personaggi che non sanno cosa devono fare (si odiano, poi si amano, poi succedono cose e basta). Succedeva anche nel primo, però quantomeno gli davo il beneficio del dubbio.  Si passa da una scena all'altra senza contestualizzare un minimo. Pieno di forzature e scene senza senso lunghissime. Stagisti che vanno in una suite, problemi di coppia mai risolti, offese ed insulti senza senso.  Evidentemente se la critica lo ha bocciato un motivo c'è. Non mi spiego il successo per il pubblico. Non so cosa abbiano visto. Se volete un film per dormire è perfetto, però abbassate il volume perchè altrimenti quando urlano verrete svegliati.
/m/after_we_collided	bcbebdf8-e3bd-3835-a0e8-4e1f0e358a9c	5	Best film i've ever watched. An absolute 10/10. True cinematic masterpeice.

Tense, well acted, good music bit crazy but interesting and weird in a David Lynchian ‘question everything' kinda way. Skips about to build up those questions and intrigue then goes pretty bananas. Genuinely worth watching if you liked IT Follows, Midsommar / hereditary. Or I'm into shit films🤷‍♂️
/m/broil	efa248ce-0fa3-366f-907f-f8bd71c82a91	1.5	An awful mess. Could have been something, but falls way short of anything worth merit.
/m/broil	efa248ce-0fa3-366f-907f-f8bd71c82a91	0.5	August was clearly the antagonist. But, seriously, what was the goal here? There were 3 stories going on that didn't tie together and it jumped scenes and made no sense.
/m/broil	efa248ce-0fa3-366f-907f-f8bd71c82a91	4	Solid all around.  Well acted, made me feel invested in the characters.
/m/over_the_moon_2020	c643166d-6db7-44c2-accf-7dd40278a398	3	Over the Moon is a 2020 computer-animated musical fantasy film directed by Glen Keane for Pearl Studio 🌝   It's ok, but I feel mixed about this one 😉 I'd recommend it if you like this genre, but if not then probably give it a miss 👍🏼👎🏼  I enjoyed the scenes on Earth much more than those on the Moon.  BELIEVING IS EVERYTHING
/m/over_the_moon_2020	c643166d-6db7-44c2-accf-7dd40278a398	1	Omg STOP SINGING! The lead just sings. I am so sick of her at this point. 15 min of it was more than enough for me I just can't.
/m/over_the_moon_2020	c643166d-6db7-44c2-accf-7dd40278a398	3.5	the movie in itself is really good and beautiful to watch, but the music sucks in my opinion.
/m/over_the_moon_2020	c643166d-6db7-44c2-accf-7dd40278a398	2	What a boring, corny and conventional story... Nice animation though, and one good character (Chin)
/m/over_the_moon_2020	c643166d-6db7-44c2-accf-7dd40278a398	1	I wanted to like this, but the plot was meandering all over itself. It just kept contradicting itself and none of the resolutions had any real staying power, since they felt weird and arbitrary... the deepest conflict of the movie - the moon goddess’s loneliness - was resolved with a trite message through a poorly-crafted song..., like.... the biggest conflict of the plot.... it stunk m. And then there’s the characters... while I loved mei mei right away, everyone else feel corny and contrived... and borrowed from Disney in the least creative way possible. They moon palace looks unmistakably like the Disney castle, the moon world is stolen from inside out, the comic character is a cheap and uninteresting copy of Frozen’s Olaf... and so many other problems..., Also, the music was altogether forgettable, the hooks weak and vanilla, the lyrics were so explicitly tied to the details in the story that it was awkward and clunky, and the melodies were unimaginative. Poor voice acting, poor plot construction, a ton of stolen ideas, and bad music.... yeah... this is worth passing on For what it’s worth, the Chinese cultural tie-in was great, but the entire second act was a departure that completely betrayed it... Yeah... it stunk. Pass
/m/over_the_moon_2020	c643166d-6db7-44c2-accf-7dd40278a398	1	This movie had no sense at all and the characters...come on the rabit with the little bunny looked like pedofile. The first 20 minutes of the movie were great. After that bored
/m/over_the_moon_2020	c643166d-6db7-44c2-accf-7dd40278a398	4	Heart-melting animation and a refreshing window of Chinese culture make this wacky space fantasy a family-friendly blast.
/m/over_the_moon_2020	c643166d-6db7-44c2-accf-7dd40278a398	3.5	As someone who is ethnically Chinese, it's refreshing to see an animated movie that revolves around a culturally familiar theme. The whimsical elements are fun to watch, and the creative updates to the myth, a surprise. However, that's not the reason why I think it is good. Rather, I connected with it from a more personal (and universal) perspective. I lost my father years ago and this film spoke to me.
/m/over_the_moon_2020	c643166d-6db7-44c2-accf-7dd40278a398	2	The plot was thin, the storyline was not entertaining.  The story did not make sense.
/m/over_the_moon_2020	c643166d-6db7-44c2-accf-7dd40278a398	2.5	Over the Moon follows the story of Fei Fei as she builds a rocket to go to the moon, to stubbornly prove that the stories and myths told by her dead mother are actually true. I have always appreciated Glen Keane's work. For one of the first features of a emerging studio, the animation is quite beautiful. However, despite the pretty graphics the story is at once and all together, stale yet bizarre, too much and yet not enough. Fei Fei's story doesn't start out on the right foot. It just doesn't quite make sense that this teenage girl is hanging onto some bedtime story that her mom told her, even though - yes I understand - it's a metaphor for her not getting over her mom's death. The presentation of Lunaria is even more bizarre, with a visual presentation that is jarring for a movie based on a Chinese myth. This risk didn't pay off. I applaud the innovation, but ultimately this movie didn't come together.
/m/white_noise_2020	d45dc5c6-1238-4ac4-a209-2eb1d2248a4f	5	A great and illuminating film
/m/white_noise_2020	d45dc5c6-1238-4ac4-a209-2eb1d2248a4f	0.5	Disingenuous manipulated crap. Pretty standard journalism these days, though, isn't it. Unlike Lauren Southern, who is no racist.
/m/white_noise_2020	d45dc5c6-1238-4ac4-a209-2eb1d2248a4f	5	This an important film which exposes the people who promote hate for what they are.
/m/white_noise_2020	d45dc5c6-1238-4ac4-a209-2eb1d2248a4f	0.5	I had seen this and I am sickened and appalled! Why is the Atlantic and Lombroso needlessly platforming these people and giving attention to their hateful ideology? What are they trying to achieve by humanizing these awful people and to release this at a time when white supremacy is on the rise and when POC are vulnerable and are being attacked? To the Atlantic please ask yourselves, how is this being good ally?
/m/white_noise_2020	d45dc5c6-1238-4ac4-a209-2eb1d2248a4f	0.5	This movie made no sense, what was the point? It unnecessarily gives platfom to fascists, and it fails to properly denounce their violent and racist ideology.  Seriously what was the conclusion? This movie doesn't help the fight against fascism, it only  helps fascists to reach new audiences with the help of The Atlantic.
/m/white_noise_2020	d45dc5c6-1238-4ac4-a209-2eb1d2248a4f	5	Incredible Access to the Underbelly of the Alt Right. "I don't think it would be endearing to put such an emphasis on that, what does it matter to me," a stunning turn from the alt-right ice Queen. Cernovich the pill pushing huckster and Spencer the former theater director's in his mother's Whitefish mansion, just unreal.
/m/white_noise_2020	d45dc5c6-1238-4ac4-a209-2eb1d2248a4f	5	The first feature-length documentary by The Atlantic shines as it exposes the darkness behind the alt-right movement. Through the focus on 3 of its prominent figures, Director Daniel Lombroso allows the viewer to consider its political influence, dissonance, and fear-driven hatred.  Never is there a dull moment as every dialogue, interview, and video graphic feels intentional. From beginning to end, the film is as harrowing as it is enthralling.
/m/the_secrets_we_keep	d19fbcc3-57b1-4f49-91f8-e9e7d1587eff	4	Thriller che vive totalmente intorno al dubbio su chi ha ragione tra la protagonista (ottima) Rapace e quello che a sua detta sarebbe stato il suo aguzzino durante la guerra. La suspance si sente, e cresce col passare dei minuti fino ad un finale ottimamente orchestrato. L'inizio invece catapulta un po' troppo velocemente lo spettatore nel fitto della trama, senza dargli il tempo di capire la vita familiare prima dello scossone.
/m/the_secrets_we_keep	d19fbcc3-57b1-4f49-91f8-e9e7d1587eff	4.5	Great movie.  Thrilling tense and suspenseful.
/m/the_secrets_we_keep	d19fbcc3-57b1-4f49-91f8-e9e7d1587eff	2	Chris Messina was the one shining grace in this film. Overreacted and brutal.
/m/the_secrets_we_keep	d19fbcc3-57b1-4f49-91f8-e9e7d1587eff	4	Wasn't expecting a whole lot originally but was pleasantly surprised. I think all of the actors were good and the storyline wasn't easily predictable. At the end I was both entertained and certainly didn't feel I wasted my time.
/m/the_secrets_we_keep	d19fbcc3-57b1-4f49-91f8-e9e7d1587eff	3	Overall, The Secrets We Keep is quite a dramatic story, but to my surprise, it also has an element of mystery which was nice to see. Actress Noomi Rapace was great in this film and I truly felt for her character as she deals with both an upsetting past and a possible opportunity for revenge. Once viewers know the movie's reveal, I'm saddened to say that it's unlikely movie lovers will wish to re-visit this film.  In the end, I found many ingredients of this film pleasing - Walkden Entertainment
/m/the_secrets_we_keep	d19fbcc3-57b1-4f49-91f8-e9e7d1587eff	3.5	The movie did have some elements that were implausible yet depicted the Nazi horror inflicted on Maya and its emotional scars  very well. The soundtrack/score was quite good.
/m/the_secrets_we_keep	d19fbcc3-57b1-4f49-91f8-e9e7d1587eff	3	Rapace is one of my favorites, but the way this movie plays out doesn't do her a lot of favors.  She's been the victim of war crimes in WWII - but the tension that she's crazy or that she's found her captor plays out weirdly.
/m/the_secrets_we_keep	d19fbcc3-57b1-4f49-91f8-e9e7d1587eff	4	As usual excellent thus all in all best movies are underrated. This one deserves much accolade in all departments.
/m/the_secrets_we_keep	d19fbcc3-57b1-4f49-91f8-e9e7d1587eff	4	I thought this was well done in parsing out its very heavy, traumatic content, and the acting is excellent. The ending ties a minimalist bow on the title concept.
/m/the_secrets_we_keep	d19fbcc3-57b1-4f49-91f8-e9e7d1587eff	2.5	The past always catches up.  Set in post-WWII America, this is about a Romanian woman who is a mother, a wife, and an immigrant (Noomi Rapace).  She sees a man on the street (Joel Kinnaman) who she believes committed atrocious war crimes against her, so as anybody would do, she abducts him and holds him captive in her basement with the help of her husband (Chris Messina).  Now I feel like I am dragging the bottom of the lake for movies to watch at this point.  I'm still trying to hit my quota of 130 films watched in a year, but 2020 has made it difficult for obvious reasons.  I knew nothing about this, only that it stars Noomi Rapace, also known as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  But watching a movie cold can be exciting, right?  As somewhat expected from a film that nobody is talking about, this was just okay.  I don't think that The Secrets We Keep is a bad movie; it just never rises to become anything special.  It is routine more than anything, and even if you quickly read the plot description, you can easily guess what this movie is all about.  Even though she is wholly convinced, you, as an audience member, are never sure if this is a case of mistaken identity or not, and that is the most engaging dynamic of the story.  It puts this husband in a moral quandary, and Chris Messina is an actor I always love to see.  This movie does have the right pieces, and in more capable hands, this could have been something worthwhile.  As it stands, this never breaks through.  The first act is all about setting the stage for the drama between this trio later, and that is where I feel this movie most drops the ball.  Sure, there is an underlying sense of impending doom as you try to deduce what exactly is going on, but this is where we should get to know the characters.  You don't learn much of anything about Noomi Rapace other than she is a survivor, and I feel like that ended up being a hindrance because she's the main character that should have some depth to rouse sympathy.  Instead, this movie is more interested in being a slow-burn thriller, but there's never enough here to keep your attention fully grasped.  The hostage situation that this movie becomes is occasionally compelling, but this is a story that kept losing me.  These two aren't criminal masterminds, so it makes sense that would be sloppy in this scenario, but it doesn't excuse why the police are so terrible at their job.  It's not even like these two are good liars, and even the neighbors should be able to tell that something is amiss.  I will refer you to the neighbor in American Murder to rest my case.  I suppose you could do worse than The Secrets We Keep, but you could certainly do better.
/m/david_byrnes_american_utopia	8f19c6cc-4da9-4475-9304-eb92aa0c388e	5	The play was thought provoking and entertaining. As always David Byrne continues to shine and be creative, collaborative, and has what a personality!
/m/david_byrnes_american_utopia	8f19c6cc-4da9-4475-9304-eb92aa0c388e	3	Music, performance and staging of the show was great. Interview with Spike Lee at the beginning was an annoying waste of time. That opener only detracted from the film.
/m/david_byrnes_american_utopia	8f19c6cc-4da9-4475-9304-eb92aa0c388e	1.5	It's a bad sign when a movie opens with a dull conversation between the creators that previews and explains the show that you are about to see. Clearly there is something wrong with the show if it's not self-explanatory.  But actually David Byrne's American Utopia IS self-explanatory. It's just that it's also pretty boring. The music is OK, but one wonders how much more exciting the music would have been if Byrne hadn't basically replaced Talking Heads ensemble with a milquetoast (but diverse!) group of musicians and dancers. I say that because the most engaging songs are Talking Heads originals, not the songs from the David Byrne solo album that this show was inspired by.  I imagine the show would have been more riveting and engaging live and in person. On-screen, American Utopia feels underwhelming and lonely.
/m/david_byrnes_american_utopia	8f19c6cc-4da9-4475-9304-eb92aa0c388e	4	A barefooted (Lord knows why but I'm fascinated nevertheless) and grey-suited David Byrne on a (mostly) bare stage runs through his Talking Heads hits and personal favourites (I'm as shocked as I'm ecstatic when Lazy pops up as the third number), he's joined by similarly attired dancers and musicians filling up the stage with oddly hypnotic but strangely compelling choreography in this 2019 Broadway show which this documentary captures in its full glory. For some reason, I expected there to be more of a narrative threading through the numbers but it turns out to be a fairly straightforward concert after all. In between his energetic and boisterous performances, Byrne, the demurred but charismatic raconteur, shines in a few seemingly random anecdotes and musings on a variety of subject matters, ranging from baby neurology to Dadaism and more heartfelt political pleads urging people to register to vote as well as the Black Lives Matter movement. Directed by Spike Lee, his contribution comes into being when he's able to showcase the clever theatricality of the show's lighting and its use of space and depth in lesser known numbers which rightfully get more production. With up to 12 people on stage at the same time, the choreography often turns into dancing in formation and Lee's Busby Berkeley-influenced aerial shots add a new perspective that the audiences are not privy to. Part summary of Byrne's amazing career, part snapshot of where America is at in 2019, this is a joyous and infectious experience that's brimful of positivity. You won't be disappointed if you're a fan and this will be the next best thing to actually being in the audience; for everyone else, you will still be tapping your feet along to the percussive-heavy music which are simply impossible to resist.
/m/david_byrnes_american_utopia	8f19c6cc-4da9-4475-9304-eb92aa0c388e	2.5	American Utopia is a 2020 American concert film directed and produced by Spike Lee 🎶   Meh, it passed the time.  Just. 😐 👍🏼👎🏼  A SPIKE LEE JOINT FROM THE ACCLAIMED BROADWAY SHOW
/m/david_byrnes_american_utopia	8f19c6cc-4da9-4475-9304-eb92aa0c388e	2	I love Talking Heads. David Byrne has done an excellent job in bring the music of Talking Heads to the stage, adapting the tunes to theatre form with the help of a superb supporting cast. But how this has got wonderful reviews from many film reviewers baffles me. This isn't a film, by any stretch of the word. Spike Lee directing the footage doesn't make it a film, it just makes it a stage production filmed by an Oscar winner. I didn't see Metallica's S&M 2, their live collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony getting reviewed by any film critics on its release a few months ago. Maybe if James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich had approached Spike Lee to direct the footage of the live show, presumably S&M 2 would then have got 5 stars from the Guardian, Telegraph et al. If you love Talking Heads, this is worth a watch as the songs are pretty untouchable. But it's not a film.
/m/david_byrnes_american_utopia	8f19c6cc-4da9-4475-9304-eb92aa0c388e	5	Utterly uplifting and joyous! Messages about inclusion and appreciation of differences as well...who could ask for anything more?
/m/david_byrnes_american_utopia	8f19c6cc-4da9-4475-9304-eb92aa0c388e	3.5	David had always been  tad off center.. Here he brings back some elements of "Stop Making Sense"...For me, that is one of the best concert films of all time...Spike Led directed this effort and there is a bit of LEFT leaning thoughts here and there...Alright, they are artists expressing themselves...I get it...The qroup on stage move continually, but the two lead dancers become annoying after a bit...For me, a little too much...It is a joy to see David performing these days...One hopes for utopia, especially now...but dreams and wishes don't make it happen...
/m/david_byrnes_american_utopia	8f19c6cc-4da9-4475-9304-eb92aa0c388e	4.5	This joyous, exuberant concert film by director Spike Lee of a live recording of a Broadway performance of musician David Byrne, based on the title album including songs throughout his career. Within the confined parameters of the square stage, surrounded by grey curtains, Byrne and his marching band, dressed in grey suits and often appearing barefoot, perform their songs. The band uses wireless or portable equipment with lively choreography by Annie-B Parson, and an expressive use of lighting that highlights performers, and even the audience, at crucial moments. Lee puts the camera on stage so we can feel the vibrancy of the performances. There are few unnecessary reaction shots to the audience and he even puts the camera in the rafters, looking down at the performers. Byrne is a performance artist so it has elements of participatory theater as Byrne attempts to convey the need for human connection. The movie culminates with the band's extraordinarily plaintive rendition of Janelle Monae's protest song "Hell You Talmbout." David Byrne, as the lead singer of the band Talking Heads, appeared in Jonathan Demme's concert classic "Stop Making Sense," and Spike Lee's movie is a new modern classic of the genre.
/m/david_byrnes_american_utopia	8f19c6cc-4da9-4475-9304-eb92aa0c388e	5	Very moving, energetic and full of positive energy!
/m/alone_2020_3	06513f89-777a-4d2a-b905-101bc1c26f4d	2	I've seen people say the Korean version is better I have not seen it. This film does have some elements that are enjoyable but fails in other areas. The main actor does hold up the film well I wasn't looking for an excuse to turn it off but I'll forget the film exists in the morning
/m/alone_2020_3	06513f89-777a-4d2a-b905-101bc1c26f4d	3.5	Dating is tough, but in the zombie apocalypse it's even tougher. Alone is basically tinder during the zombie apocalypse except you  only have 1 person to choose from on your dating app, so who you date is a easy choice. The zombies are different in Alone than other zombie movies, the zombies actually talk and are self aware that they are zombies, its a different take on zombies, but whats most important to me is they are fast zombies. Donald Sutherland gets over billed in this movie as he has a very small part. Alone is about Tyler Posey surviving the zombie apocalypse by himself, seeing Summer Spiro in the next apartment complex, and then Tyler Posey trying to find a way to get the two of them together.
/m/alone_2020_3	06513f89-777a-4d2a-b905-101bc1c26f4d	3.5	I liked it, I thought it was good.  I liked it.  They built tension and the zombies looked good and were scary.  I was even unsure if one aspect was going to be all in his mind or if it was really happening.  I liked that they had a couple of news reports along the way to break things down.  I thought they did a good job for what I expected to be a low budget scary movie.
/m/alone_2020_3	06513f89-777a-4d2a-b905-101bc1c26f4d	0.5	There’s a Korean version of this film watch that one skip this one
/m/alone_2020_3	06513f89-777a-4d2a-b905-101bc1c26f4d	3	Remake of the Korean film #Alive that is not up to par. Was not invested enough to care whether or not Tyler Posey's character makes it out alive.
/m/alone_2020_3	06513f89-777a-4d2a-b905-101bc1c26f4d	2.5	Although seemingly hundreds of movies have been based around the idea of a mysterious virus overtaking civilization and turning them into zombies, this one is less about that and more of a human story of a man who lives alone in an apartment complex who has barricaded himself in his place to survive but food is running out.  I also liked that they didn't refer to the infected as zombies, but as people with cannibalistic tendencies.  Good story performed well by the limited cast.  Surprisingly enjoyable for a tired genre.
/m/alone_2020_3	06513f89-777a-4d2a-b905-101bc1c26f4d	2.5	English remake of a Korean zombie film. Low budget but well acted.
/m/alone_2020_3	06513f89-777a-4d2a-b905-101bc1c26f4d	4.5	The first 15 minutes are a little rough, but overall i think it`s a great movie. It was a breath of fresh air for me.
/m/alone_2020_3	06513f89-777a-4d2a-b905-101bc1c26f4d	3.5	This is a remake of Alive so it's basically the same film. In the film, Aidan (Tyler Posey) barricaded, isolated himself in his apartment when the zombie pandemic begins. He lost his family, his internet, phone and power cut off and he saw a young woman named Eva (Summer Spiro), the two bonded with each other and prepares to fight against the zombies/Screamers. I have high praise for Tyler Posey and Donald Sutherland roles, the film score, makeup and visuals.
/m/alone_2020_3	06513f89-777a-4d2a-b905-101bc1c26f4d	4	This movie was surprisingly good.  Its a little slow paced for a zombie film, but it kind of uses that to build suspense.  The zombies have a unique charactistic that makes them so much creepier.  The acting was good, visuals were good, had a good story, and some unique zombies. If they came out with a sequel, I would watch it.
/m/the_opening_act	7bf1d8bd-00b4-3f5d-9ccd-9cf4936d1871	3.5	It was fine... funny.

I can’t stress enough how terrible of a stand up this guy was at stand up . It inspires me to give stand up a shot . Tom segura legit made a 30 second appearance and was great
/m/the_opening_act	7bf1d8bd-00b4-3f5d-9ccd-9cf4936d1871	5	Loved it! Great performances by several comedians. It's an all star cast. Loved the DJ radio scene. Great quick tags on great tension on great big comedians...holy shit Russell Peters. And you can tell Will Burr is having fun!  My favorite moments come from the balance between Neil Brennan and Cedric The Entertainer's relationship with Jimmy Yang. In the end, it's a love letter to comedy. Highly recommend if you enjoy laughing and self reflection. Great film by Steve Byrne.
/m/the_opening_act	7bf1d8bd-00b4-3f5d-9ccd-9cf4936d1871	3	The story of every wannabe comedians struggles. It does well explaining everything in an organic way. It's pretty shallow of a movie where characters are barley explored and plot is pretty obvious. Guy struggling kinda makes it in end. Was nice to see all the comedians. But some dialogue was cringe and forced.
/m/the_opening_act	7bf1d8bd-00b4-3f5d-9ccd-9cf4936d1871	5	Directed by Steve Byrne and starring Jimmy O. Yang among other comedians is a great movie. If you've ever gone to see a comedian and wondered what it was like to get into clubs then you will enjoy this movie.
/m/the_opening_act	7bf1d8bd-00b4-3f5d-9ccd-9cf4936d1871	5	Great movie! If your a stand up nerd it is a Where's Waldo of comics.
/m/the_opening_act	7bf1d8bd-00b4-3f5d-9ccd-9cf4936d1871	5	Loved this movie. Such an exciting look into the world of Standup Comedy.
/m/the_opening_act	7bf1d8bd-00b4-3f5d-9ccd-9cf4936d1871	4.5	This is a Cinderella story, of sorts. Jimmy O. Yang does a fantastic job as Will Chu, an aspiring standup with serious confidence issues. He doesn't take advice very well and when he bombs, I had serious empathy. He can really sell that kind of sympathy.  I worked in a comedy club for a summer and there are a lot of angry, damaged comedians. Glad that this movie spares us from that. What we are shown are a lot of comedians with other issues. Will Chu has issues, but has managed not to gorge on substances or empty hook-ups.  Cedric The Entertainer seriously delivers as the successful headliner and sage elder. Alex Moffat does a great job creating a believable character. The rest of the star comedians occupy their roles beautifully. Writer/director Steve Byrne does a fantastic job coralling what was surely ego overload and everyone shines in small ways because of it.

/m/friendsgiving	c46008bb-8948-3b1d-b1f2-60532a71d35f	0.5	No heart or humour. There isn't a single character to root for or to latch onto. Very poor considering the talented cast.
/m/friendsgiving	c46008bb-8948-3b1d-b1f2-60532a71d35f	1	Boring. Not one laugh. Not even a smile. No real plot. No idea where it was going. Awful. Hated every character, but maybe I was meant to. Gave up with about 30 mins to go. Life's too short
/m/friendsgiving	c46008bb-8948-3b1d-b1f2-60532a71d35f	1	This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. I'm not sure there was a writer present when the script was put together. I'm not sure what you would laugh at, as there are not any jokes. Quite literally, nothing happens. I have had more exciting trips to the fridge
/m/friendsgiving	c46008bb-8948-3b1d-b1f2-60532a71d35f	1	I created this account simply to rate it as bad as possible. Terrible.
/m/friendsgiving	c46008bb-8948-3b1d-b1f2-60532a71d35f	2.5	It had good material and cast however for some reason they didn't take advantage of that and it's just mediocre, maybe for a sunday afternoon
/m/friendsgiving	c46008bb-8948-3b1d-b1f2-60532a71d35f	3	Nice idea falls flat. Take a great collection of actors and have their neurotic lives collide at an impromptu Thanksgiving gathering. They would exchange witty barbs and clever repartee... except if didn't. The dialog tries to be edgy and charming but never makes it there. It's bland and cloying when they try to make the turn. The bloopers at the end are more entertaining than the movie.
/m/friendsgiving	c46008bb-8948-3b1d-b1f2-60532a71d35f	0.5	I love, love, love Kat Dennings, but this movie was a total stinkbomb.
/m/friendsgiving	c46008bb-8948-3b1d-b1f2-60532a71d35f	1.5	May be I'm just not the target audience.
/m/tar_2020	54257b41-9fa5-4978-95f0-05184f98a421	5	Halloween fun! Perfect for the season
/m/tar_2020	54257b41-9fa5-4978-95f0-05184f98a421	5	Reminds me of 90s adventure movies that have scares like that one with the spiders. See it!
/m/tar_2020	54257b41-9fa5-4978-95f0-05184f98a421	5	Very fun, very worth it.
/m/tar_2020	54257b41-9fa5-4978-95f0-05184f98a421	5	This movie is fun. Not what I expected in a good way. Not straight horror, more adventure and fun. I def want to go to the Tar Pits now!
/m/tar_2020	54257b41-9fa5-4978-95f0-05184f98a421	5	Super Scary & Fun to Watch. Had me on the edge of my seat.
/m/tar_2020	54257b41-9fa5-4978-95f0-05184f98a421	5	this is the fun I needed in this year. suspense and great cast and funny and adventure. some heart and creatures
/m/tar_2020	54257b41-9fa5-4978-95f0-05184f98a421	4.5	Fun to see a modern nod to those old-time monster flicks.
/m/tar_2020	54257b41-9fa5-4978-95f0-05184f98a421	5	Caught this just in time for Halloween. Tarrific little horror flick with lots of laughs and scares. Can't believe nobody's thought of this concept before!
/m/tar_2020	54257b41-9fa5-4978-95f0-05184f98a421	4.5	Tar is a classic campy horror flick. Good fun all around. We thoroughly enjoyed!
/m/tar_2020	54257b41-9fa5-4978-95f0-05184f98a421	5	This movie is exactly what we needed this time of year, a good ole fashioned creature feature!
/m/totally_under_control	3b4a6b1d-72b3-374b-8c9d-3f06e2ff5c0f	2	I thought it was too overblown and of course not getting into everything, just what and how they want to cover the issues.
/m/totally_under_control	3b4a6b1d-72b3-374b-8c9d-3f06e2ff5c0f	0.5	A completely biased hit piece. Sad excuse for a movie.
/m/totally_under_control	3b4a6b1d-72b3-374b-8c9d-3f06e2ff5c0f	3.5	An infuriating documentary about the Trump administration's mishandling of the pandemic, 'Totally Under Control' can be a depressing watch at times, but it gets its point across in a very effective manner.  Many more documentaries will be made about the last year, but this one is very well put together.  Everyone should watch this.
/m/totally_under_control	3b4a6b1d-72b3-374b-8c9d-3f06e2ff5c0f	4.5	A documentary on Hulu about how the US government and public health agencies dealt with the coronavirus pandemic and how we got to the point before October 2020. Quite a disturbing and shocking revelation of how politics dominated over science and helped spread the preventable pandemic. Definitely a must watch to learn about the coming of the pandemic in the US. 9/10
/m/totally_under_control	3b4a6b1d-72b3-374b-8c9d-3f06e2ff5c0f	5	Great documentary. There are some that will rate this movie poorly and say it's "biased." But the truth of the matter is: they don't want to face reality. Our national government failed extraordinarily to contain this virus.
/m/totally_under_control	3b4a6b1d-72b3-374b-8c9d-3f06e2ff5c0f	4.5	Alex Gibney and his team secretly made this doc about the handling of the Coronavirus Pandemic by the United States and the federal government.  Save this for posterity.  It's an even handed approach, unless facts hurt your feelings.  Gibney is able to break little ground but he doesn't need to.  This is a message in a bottle that will show the incompetence of the federal government to control a pandemic while other nations did.  The bottom line as legendary football coach Bill Parcells said "you are what your record says you are."  Yikes.  9.0/10
/m/totally_under_control	3b4a6b1d-72b3-374b-8c9d-3f06e2ff5c0f	3.5	When understanding 2020, this will be a good place to start. Totally Under Control covers the beginning response of the Trump administration really well, but in a fast-moving world, it's already outdated now. This did provide a good behind-the-scenes view of the chaos that was happening, and the things I learned shocked me.
/m/totally_under_control	3b4a6b1d-72b3-374b-8c9d-3f06e2ff5c0f	5	This is truly an eye opener..... everything would make sense once you watch this great documentary.
/m/totally_under_control	3b4a6b1d-72b3-374b-8c9d-3f06e2ff5c0f	5	My hope is we all learn from this overview of what went wrong, why and how to move forward as a united nation.
/m/totally_under_control	3b4a6b1d-72b3-374b-8c9d-3f06e2ff5c0f	5	Well done and scary to see how the USA failed to control
/m/dont_look_back_2020	8814c6c9-f324-3e88-9a5f-50431d903d66	2.5	This movie should not be called Don't Look Back. Instead, it should be Don't Think Back or Don't Think Too Much. It was not scary and plot was too easy to guess. Acting part is not bad.
/m/dont_look_back_2020	8814c6c9-f324-3e88-9a5f-50431d903d66	0.5	The worse movie seen in a long time. Disappointed I've wasted precious life on this. Storyline acting … a lot to be desired..
/m/dont_look_back_2020	8814c6c9-f324-3e88-9a5f-50431d903d66	1.5	It is a movie.  I am sure that the people who made it have parents that are very proud of them.   It is not a good one.  It looks like it was shot on someones phone. The screenplay  is barebones and seems cribbed from a half-remembered Dean Kootnz novel. The actors would be fine understudies at a local playhouse.  But to its credit, it does land the ending with more style than the rest of the movie so I rounded it up to 1 1/2 stars.
/m/dont_look_back_2020	8814c6c9-f324-3e88-9a5f-50431d903d66	5	Found this gem by accident! I love a good thriller! Good twists!
/m/dont_look_back_2020	8814c6c9-f324-3e88-9a5f-50431d903d66	2	Run of the mill thriller, not horrible, but definitely not good.
/m/dont_look_back_2020	8814c6c9-f324-3e88-9a5f-50431d903d66	4	Starting with a brutally realistic of news reel footage, Jeffrey tells us that what we are about to see is no comedy, and he isn't wrong. Dont Look Back is a smart thriller which will get you talking about ‘what would you do' if you were in the situation Caitlin is in, would you intervene, or not get involved. Whilst its very easy to decide before the event, its a little more difficult once you find yourself face to face with violence.  Jeffrey in his feature directorial debut has crafted a fantastic thriller which holds you from the opening seconds, and doesn't let go until the end. Whilst the film will of course appeal to horror fans, the film also works just as well (if not better) as a psychological thriller in the same way The Omen does, or even Final Destination ( written by Jeffrey Reddick). You can watch this film and see the paranormal elements to the plot to it, or you can view the film without those those, its perfectly balanced and works either way with no lesser enjoyment whichever mindset you watch it with.  isually great, wonderfully casted (especially Kourtney Bell as Caitlin) and a great directing (and writing) job by Jeffrey Reddick, with Don't Look Back, being his feature length debut, Im very excited to see what he has in store for us next
/m/dont_look_back_2020	8814c6c9-f324-3e88-9a5f-50431d903d66	5	I agree that during the beginning of this movie I was sceptical because of the average B grade acting, not to mention the obviously annoying enemy in the brother of the dead guy. However, this movie comes with a final twist/finale that made the 'Karma' theme of the movie mesh and flow so well. Would watch this again and recommend because I believe that without word of mouth this would be an underrated gem.
/m/the_disrupted	da1cd3ab-879d-4927-87aa-22152fbbef29	4	Actually the filmmaker, Sarah Colt, was being prescient in this narrative of 3 families pre-Covid and subsequent economic collapse. As a filmmaker, she is possessed of a tender heart and a beautiful eye. She has also chosen compelling subjects. The ones in particular who grabbed me were the young couple we see in the accompanying picture. They moved me, well all of them did, and I would love to know how they are faring. Visually and thematically interesting. Give it a watch!
/m/the_disrupted	da1cd3ab-879d-4927-87aa-22152fbbef29	5	It was a beautiful movie that captured the struggle of hard working Americans everywhere. It followed three different people and their amazing families as they navigated unemployment, debt and the challenges of making a living wage in America today. A heartfelt film for sure made for these times.
/m/the_disrupted	da1cd3ab-879d-4927-87aa-22152fbbef29	5	A heartbreaking look at the realities that "regular" people are facing.  Eye-opening.  If you care about other people's experiences in the US now, watch this.
/m/the_disrupted	da1cd3ab-879d-4927-87aa-22152fbbef29	5	A beautiful and timely film about how the "American Dream" seems economically out of reach for many Americans.  In this intimate and touching documentary, you enter the lives of three struggling workers.  What sacrifices do Uber drivers make?  How does the sense of responsibility to past and future generations weigh on a small farmer?  How does the unemployment system support those who desperately need it?  With beautiful filming you will find yourself in the Uber queue, at a cattle sale, and in an HVAC class.  The incredible subjects will tell you much that you need to know.
/m/the_disrupted	da1cd3ab-879d-4927-87aa-22152fbbef29	5	The Disrupted is about as depressing and hopeful as a film can be in 2020--millions of Americans go hungry everyday, income inequality is higher than its ever been, we have a global pandemic on our hands with no end in sight--and yet each individual story shows people with great resolve who want better for themselves and their families. The three main subjects are rendered as neither good nor bad, instead simply human. It's a rare film that strikes that balance. The narrative is perfect for its time; it is equally pessimistic about our systems as it is optimistic about human nature. What I enjoy most about this film is that it refuses to declare one of those truths as more legitimate than the other.
/m/the_disrupted	da1cd3ab-879d-4927-87aa-22152fbbef29	5	This important  film captures the angst faced by three American families as they try to find their way through the trials and tribulations of the challenging US pre-pandemic economy.  The stunning  cinematography wraps an powerful story which deepens our understanding of our nation's evolving workforce. I highly recommend  this captivating film to all.
/m/the_disrupted	da1cd3ab-879d-4927-87aa-22152fbbef29	5	Really good and sometimes hard look at the difficulties of making it in America today. Beautifully filmed and well balanced between the three central characters current  lives and efforts.
/m/the_disrupted	da1cd3ab-879d-4927-87aa-22152fbbef29	4.5	Each story was poignant and moving. The Uber lady with seemingly happy daughters but waiting 30th in  line for  a customer; the younger couple with marriage and economic problems while dealing with a child in need and a cancerous farmer who, perhaps, said it best...."How can one own 900 acres of America and not survive?"  The acting was excellent. The transitioning between segments helped to maintain interest.  In comparisonIt does bring to mind the millions suffering from evictions and starvation.
/m/the_disrupted	da1cd3ab-879d-4927-87aa-22152fbbef29	5	The Disrupted is a timely watch before the election. The emotional journey of each of the characters took me for a ride. I was amazed by the beautiful cinematography and lyrical editing.
/m/the_disrupted	da1cd3ab-879d-4927-87aa-22152fbbef29	4.5	The movies was well done. It shows the impact the economy had on three families. The changes that came about since the last recession and how corporate Americahas abandoned individuals for higher profits. The most telling statement was made by Don the farmer. "You can own 800 acres and still not able to make a decent living."  I enjoyed the film making and how the story was woven together.
/m/rom_boys_40_years_of_rad	23daab62-dba5-487a-a149-6e8a91fc52c0	5	Great film.  Already watching it a second time.  As someone who grew up with a California skatepark as my babysitter until the day it was bulldozed, I can appreciate that this gem still exists. Film weaves seamlessly between the past and present time, covers skateboards and BMX and gloriously illustrates the importance of maintaining sites like this.  As shown in the film, the generations who grew up in these environments in the 1970s and beyond have produced some wonderfully creative and productive citizens.  Highly recommended.
/m/rom_boys_40_years_of_rad	23daab62-dba5-487a-a149-6e8a91fc52c0	5	An unpretentious and non-elitist history of skateboarding in the UK. From nothing to very almost nothing via some amazing highs and lows this movie documents one of the worlds only listed skateparks, built by the best as a ‘portfolio piece' his park has it all - but would be nothing without this ‘band of brothers', told by those who breathed life in to it, lived in it and very nearly died because of it. Skateboarding is their religion, the atom is their cathedral and the pool is where they get baptised. Hallelujah!
/m/rom_boys_40_years_of_rad	23daab62-dba5-487a-a149-6e8a91fc52c0	5	Absolutely amazing I definitely recommend you should go and watch this film !!
/m/rom_boys_40_years_of_rad	23daab62-dba5-487a-a149-6e8a91fc52c0	5	Definitely worth a watch!
/m/rom_boys_40_years_of_rad	23daab62-dba5-487a-a149-6e8a91fc52c0	5	Honest and true representation of the UK skate & bmx scene! Loved it from start to finish
/m/rom_boys_40_years_of_rad	23daab62-dba5-487a-a149-6e8a91fc52c0	5	Excellent film about a brilliant skatepark enjoyed every minute of it 👍🏻
/m/rom_boys_40_years_of_rad	23daab62-dba5-487a-a149-6e8a91fc52c0	5	An excellent movie not just for the skateboard & BMX fans. A true bit of history
/m/tremors_shrieker_island	0ea0a2a4-aaf2-3646-a23f-2a59124489e4	3.5	From dessert dust to Artic's freeze, now your tropical island getaway. The action & acting plot have improved over time from the suffering of the franchise's silliness, maybe due to filmmaking technology. Ops... man's generic did it again... Okay here comes the top 3: Original, Shrieker Island & The Legend Begins.
/m/tremors_shrieker_island	0ea0a2a4-aaf2-3646-a23f-2a59124489e4	1	Awful film, very corny,  no story and has used ideas from Jurassic park
/m/tremors_shrieker_island	0ea0a2a4-aaf2-3646-a23f-2a59124489e4	0.5	Ruined the entire franchise. If I could give it a negative star, I would. Don't buy it. It isn't apart of the canon.  Let's all pretend it doesn't exist - it was a bad fever dream that they need to apologize to all of the fans for. SPOILERS they killed Burt because he didn't "fit" in modern times.
/m/tremors_shrieker_island	0ea0a2a4-aaf2-3646-a23f-2a59124489e4	5	Fun. Light-hearted except when it's brutally violent. Beautiful color and scenery. Really like Jon Heder in this role. Makes me interested watching him in a serious action role. It does struggle to provide a lot of suspense; you never feel a lot of real danger for the characters. Also there's like a random new person in group shots throughout the show. And they're usually a minority lol, which isn't a good look.
/m/tremors_shrieker_island	0ea0a2a4-aaf2-3646-a23f-2a59124489e4	5	I didn't even know this movie existed. I like all of the other Tremor movies so of course this was a must see.
/m/tremors_shrieker_island	0ea0a2a4-aaf2-3646-a23f-2a59124489e4	3.5	3.5/5.  While the lack of practical effects is a bummer, Shrieker Island is an improvement over the previous two films.  It looks good, there are some really awesome moments, and the 3rd act is surprisingly emotional.
/m/tremors_shrieker_island	0ea0a2a4-aaf2-3646-a23f-2a59124489e4	1.5	I love this series, even the bad ones.  But holy cow this one was so bad I couldn't even finish it.
/m/tremors_shrieker_island	0ea0a2a4-aaf2-3646-a23f-2a59124489e4	2.5	A New Setting Can't Save ‘Tremors: Shrieker Island' from Feeling Like the Same Old Routine
/m/tremors_shrieker_island	0ea0a2a4-aaf2-3646-a23f-2a59124489e4	0.5	Disregard for all the rules set out in the original. They tried to make it into a witty action movie and failed.
/m/tremors_shrieker_island	0ea0a2a4-aaf2-3646-a23f-2a59124489e4	5	Just watched it and loved it! One of my favorites of the franchise. Tremor movies are not Citizen Kane or Apocalypse Now. It's just pure fun and it has Burt. Without Burt there is no Tremors. Pure fun and another great movie in an awesome  franchise. If you loved the others you will love this one.
/m/batman_death_in_the_family	d8d1be21-9665-4840-a9d1-cfd8ffeb45c1	5	Unbelievable! DC finally gave us what we wanted what we didn't think we wanted but now we know we wanted all along! A better movie then under the red hood! How is it possible you ask? Just watch it it's amazing! It's like every time you watch it it's something different! Literally! God bless DC for making something Historically and unbelievably beautiful!
/m/batman_death_in_the_family	d8d1be21-9665-4840-a9d1-cfd8ffeb45c1	4	5 stars for the "Death" segment. 2 & 1/2 for the rest.
/m/batman_death_in_the_family	d8d1be21-9665-4840-a9d1-cfd8ffeb45c1	4	Anyone who says "This is just a retelling of Under the Red Hood" pirated/illegally downloaded the movie. My friend did it so I know this. But if you ACTUALLY BUY THE THING you'll realise that it's not! It's an "interactive movie" that lets you make choices and make the story go different ways, with other endings so completely different from the "default" Red Hood ending. Don't believe the pirates! It lost a star because it wasn't really necessary
/m/batman_death_in_the_family	d8d1be21-9665-4840-a9d1-cfd8ffeb45c1	0.5	Just recycled footage from Under the Red Hood. Anything new has darkened borders  like a vignettes. It's very annoying.
/m/batman_death_in_the_family	d8d1be21-9665-4840-a9d1-cfd8ffeb45c1	2.5	A movie that is solely a narrative by Batman is indeed quite annoiyng
/m/batman_death_in_the_family	d8d1be21-9665-4840-a9d1-cfd8ffeb45c1	1	When I saw the thumbnail for this films trailer, I thought it was going to be a prequel to the 2010 film Under The Red Hood, but sadly this film only copies the art style and basic plot. That being said, this movie had promising potential with the idea of showing what the alternative outcomes of Death In The Family could have been, but most feel poorly written and unsatisfying. Not to mention how the film takes the animation style from the movie Batman Under The Red Hood, in order to try promoting the film via associating it with the much higher quality film. The animation feels like something you would find on Cartoon Network rather than on a Blu Ray film release. I'd give this film a skip.
/m/batman_death_in_the_family	d8d1be21-9665-4840-a9d1-cfd8ffeb45c1	1.5	I watched for ten minutes and decided i can't take an hour Ave a half of this movie.  Maybe if we got the interactive element on hbo max, it would be more interesting,  but it's like one of those cheap recap episodes cartoons have when they're running out of budget. Except it's a movie blandly recapping one of the best batman movies.  My guess is the only reason this was made is WB has to fill their animated batman movie quota and they really weren't feeling it this time.  At this point, it's hard to believe DC used to make the best animated comic book movies.
/m/batman_death_in_the_family	d8d1be21-9665-4840-a9d1-cfd8ffeb45c1	5	Best movie. It is a conplement to under the red hood
/m/batman_death_in_the_family	d8d1be21-9665-4840-a9d1-cfd8ffeb45c1	4	Honestly , this was not the worst retelling of the Death In The Family story, frankly because I have never heard Jason's death told from a narrative p.o.v. Even "Under The Red Hood" failed to put forth such a fresh perspective. This is a solid rehash of the classic pheonix - style legend of Jason Todd - the best Robin.  Now , I streamed this for free , so no interactive endings for me - but no matter. 3 dope short stories filled up that time , matching the level of R-rated maturity :  Sgt. Rock , The Seven Soilders (I believe ...) , Adam Strange , The Phantom Stranger , and Death herself for the gorgeous grand finale !  Guts, blood , coarse language , suicidal ideations , sci-fi action , and magic - nothing is spared from the comics to the screen. Shit, DC should start throwing one of these short films before their theatrical relases like Pixar , because they are so good, DC might as well be giving a Disney a run for their money - at least in the adult entertainment department.  Each film leaves a pregnant , depressing , feeling in the room - with a glimmer of hope. This is a crash course in storytelling through adult animation , which may not be the best at all times , but does the job as a medium to get these stories out from the dollar bin to a screen.
/m/batman_death_in_the_family	d8d1be21-9665-4840-a9d1-cfd8ffeb45c1	5	It was good to see if you love batman
/m/537_votes	e7ee312a-5e31-45db-8a8e-c1047134d101	0.5	Boring. Better than Ambien.
/m/537_votes	e7ee312a-5e31-45db-8a8e-c1047134d101	0.5	It was a one sided pathetic account of historical events. It even went so far as to reach and say if gore had been elected natural disasters such as Katrina wouldn't have taken place. It was a joke just like the producer is.
/m/537_votes	e7ee312a-5e31-45db-8a8e-c1047134d101	3.5	Pretty relevant to today's circumstances. It gets a little lazy sometimes with some pop culture inserts not being from the time period of interest. Also, has that one guy who is just too intense to be interviewed for a documentary. All in all though it's pretty intriguing
/m/537_votes	e7ee312a-5e31-45db-8a8e-c1047134d101	3.5	537 Votes is a timely look back at seismic political events in 2000. It digs deep down into the Presidential Election of that year. Thankfully it is also very funny, using late night TV pundits with great effect, interspersing their takes of the day into the very serious events. In 2000 the election was between Gore and Bush. Democrat and Republican. The election was extremely close and it eventually came down to who won the state of Florida. The film does a very good job of backgrounding. We see the Elian Gonzales case of the young Cuban boy and how the mostly Cuban community came to be both anti Democrat and anti Gore. The film looks into how the election was troubled by fraud and faulty election apparatus. It's a salient reminder of how fragile democracy can be. The film is razor sharp and concise and revealing.
/m/537_votes	e7ee312a-5e31-45db-8a8e-c1047134d101	5	Wow.  This was completely mind-blowing.  I never knew what happened in 2000, and now I'm so mad I can barely breath.
/m/537_votes	e7ee312a-5e31-45db-8a8e-c1047134d101	3.5	Good but way too long. Shorten it from an hour and a half to thirty minutes.  Hot Republicans stole the 2000 election.
/m/537_votes	e7ee312a-5e31-45db-8a8e-c1047134d101	3	Ahhh politics, and sadly if any swing states are close this time around, the 2000 election is going to look like a game of patty cake in comparison.
/m/buddies1985	0d987887-3b48-3d31-961f-030464e94225	5	Clearly a work of art and passion by people who have lived through it, and died shortly after. The most authentic movie ever made about HIV. A time capsule that should be preserved in the Smithsonian. It's that good.
/m/buddies1985	0d987887-3b48-3d31-961f-030464e94225	5	A 1985 time capsule of a period that all of us wanted to forget, but couldn't and shouldering.  Scripted in 5 days, shot in 9 days and edited in the director, Arthur J. Bressan's living room on a Moviola.  Holds up in every way, even after 33 years.
/m/an_imperfect_murder	951da762-6bb9-470c-b5b4-e9c944a9121a	0.5	Literally the worst movie I have ever seen and It's not even close. The first thing I found weird about this movie is how there is pretty much zero information about it. When I rented it, the title was "An Imperfect Murder", but some sites (like Rotten Tomatoes) are calling it "The Private Life of a Modern Woman". Strange. Further, it was being advertised for rental as a newer movie -- it was more than the usual $5.95. However, I'm pretty sure it came out a few years ago. There are so few reviews on the movie that I almost felt like I was watching a film students' first semester project. Anyway. The opening credits last like 20 minutes with painfully annoying music and visuals. The movie is just endless conversations with random characters about absolutely nothing. It got to the point where the dialogue began to sound like the teacher from Charle Brown. The only intriguing parts of the movie are in the trailer. There is absolutely no storyline. None whatsoever. Alec Baldwin is in the movie for maybe five minutes. Honestly he should be embarrassed that he was involved with this movie in any way. God awful. I never write reviews but I had to for this movie. The fact that the director watched the final cut and said "yeah, that's good" is honestly scary. A 9 year old with an iPod Touch could have made a better movie. I would honestly rather watch paint dry than watch this movie again. They could probably make the prisoners of Guantanamo Bay watch this and they would sing like canaries. Spare yourself. You have been warned.
/m/an_imperfect_murder	951da762-6bb9-470c-b5b4-e9c944a9121a	1	Nonsense wrapped in a bag of crap
/m/an_imperfect_murder	951da762-6bb9-470c-b5b4-e9c944a9121a	1	That was the worst movie I've ever watched!Very boring.
/m/an_imperfect_murder	951da762-6bb9-470c-b5b4-e9c944a9121a	1	I cannot believe how bad this was.  I'm 45 years old... Today I've seen the worst movie of my life.  Terrible beginning, middle drags on with zero actual point, horrible ending.  The best pet of this movie is it's short .  I've never cared about losing $5.... but in this case I'm sorta pissed.  FYI... had to give a 1 star to allow for a review. The 1 star is very generous
/m/daddys_girl_2018	3c77c6f9-6845-4a05-a925-e13acbfcba4f	2	A crazy serial killer that somehow manages to keep his stepdaughter under his control. And that is all there is to it. The lack of any depth makes this movie much less than mediocre.
/m/daddys_girl_2018	3c77c6f9-6845-4a05-a925-e13acbfcba4f	1	A terrible Film, chock-full of anti-male sentiment & an almost non-existent protagonist.....with virtually No redeeming qualities whatsoever.  (Back in the real world, does anyone remember who the No. 01 Criminal currently locked-up in America is right now? HINT: They're Not Male)
/m/eternal_beauty	b4d64d68-618d-365e-bd0e-cc81e82943dc	1.5	2 talented actors submit into this creative mess that leads nowhere. Their performances are convencing but script and it's flow damages this movie severely.
/m/eternal_beauty	b4d64d68-618d-365e-bd0e-cc81e82943dc	3.5	Very nice perspective of an actual public health issue. Amazing picture and cinematographic details that makes you want to find out more about the film and director .
/m/eternal_beauty	b4d64d68-618d-365e-bd0e-cc81e82943dc	2.5	'Eternal Beauty' is too often a portrait of cruelty, and not enough kindness.  It is, however, a showcase for the tremendous talents of Sally Hawkins.  At times, I wanted to scratch my eyeballs out, but it's beautiful.  For me, it just wasn't successful at managing the balance that writer and director Craig Roberts was shooting for.  Final Score: 5/10
/m/eternal_beauty	b4d64d68-618d-365e-bd0e-cc81e82943dc	3.5	Overcompensates for lack of visionary thesis with creative meanderings and wokish self-congratulations, but pretty well meaning and executed nonetheless.  An aggressively neurdivergent Amelie type-deal.
/m/eternal_beauty	b4d64d68-618d-365e-bd0e-cc81e82943dc	2	Eternal Beauty's comical depiction of a woman who suffers from a mental health condition is already walking a very fine line, which it quickly falls over onto the wrong side of and doesn't manage to save itself.
/m/eternal_beauty	b4d64d68-618d-365e-bd0e-cc81e82943dc	5	Awesome, original and well-acted. Sally´s brighter than ever.
/m/eternal_beauty	b4d64d68-618d-365e-bd0e-cc81e82943dc	4.5	A little difficult at first, but it is well worth the time and money. The film is seen entirely through the POV of Jane (Sally Hawkins), a paranoid schizophrenic, who sees her world entirely in the present, in a sort of chaotic, non-chronological manner. Sally Hawkins so completely inhabits her character that the mood shifts and hallucinatory scenes pulled me into Jane's mind and heart so readily that I was won over. I highly recommend Eternal Beauty.
/m/eternal_beauty	b4d64d68-618d-365e-bd0e-cc81e82943dc	4	Sally Hawkins performance in this movie is by far the best I’ve seen from any actress in all of 2020 . Idk if she has award buzz around her but she certainly should 4.0. Very sweet film with great character development that had you rooting for the lead to turn her life around and find happiness . One last note to end on, screw that mother .
/m/eternal_beauty	b4d64d68-618d-365e-bd0e-cc81e82943dc	4	The movie successfully gives us an incredible look about schizophrenia and how it is misunderstood by many and the stigma around it, it made me understand the character, beautifully portrayed by the sublime Sally Hawkins who never fails to amaze with her acting methods. It's a great mix altogether and never goes for the cliches. It's a well done and well directed film.
/m/eternal_beauty	b4d64d68-618d-365e-bd0e-cc81e82943dc	0.5	Good Lord. Yes, brilliant performances all around. But the LAST thing I wanted to see right now is a painful look at Schizophrenia.  There was no relief in sight for this poor girl, nor her messed-up family. It was a long meditation on internal pain. I'm sorry, I'm sure as a study of painful mental illness and family dysfunction, it was extremely well done, but as I said, Good Lord --- this was NOT the kind of film that even teaches a good lesson --- she comes to some sort of self-acceptance and dismissal of the chief phantom causing her pain (the boyfriend who jilted her at the alter) at the end, but wow, such a long and grindingly painful film. Whew.
/m/ms_white_light	32741c90-5361-36ac-84d8-352be761bef1	3.5	It was a naive and lovely movie, the cast made it much better than what it could've been. It was totally relatable yet different.
/m/ms_white_light	32741c90-5361-36ac-84d8-352be761bef1	4	Worth it for Roberta Colindrez's performance!
/m/the_invincible_dragon	f422d235-61a9-3601-bbe4-15687b6153dc	5	The character development is stellar and the plot is genuinely amazing, best film since Godfather Part 2!
/m/halloween_party_2020	41418fe4-8a1f-30e0-9b60-07c5d937510e	2	It's the ultimate party full of actual terror  An invite to a Halloween party for college students Grace and Zoe goes viral  It asks for the persons worst fear and saves the answers  Once the party starts for the students little do they know their phobias are actually coming to life  These entities are accidentally released tormenting invitees  The movie's pacing is pretty lackluster, there's a lot of time sleuthing what's actually happening, and some of these digital effects are kinda photoshop level  It would've been better if most if this wasn't filmed during the day and there's narrative beats you can sense coming from a mile away  These two actors are likable though despite having to spout out bad dialogue  But the movie has some insane ideas not to mention some nightmarish makeup effects working to its advantage  Plus the creepiest portion is at the very end involving navigating dark corridors underneath the college  This just could've been so much better in many respects
/m/halloween_party_2020	41418fe4-8a1f-30e0-9b60-07c5d937510e	3	It was ok in some parts but not very scary
/m/halloween_party_2020	41418fe4-8a1f-30e0-9b60-07c5d937510e	2	The acting was very cringey, there were some parts I felt like dragged on too long and the ending was meh.
/m/halloween_party_2020	41418fe4-8a1f-30e0-9b60-07c5d937510e	3.5	I didn't care for the ending. The nerd deserved to get the girl, but other than the lazy writing at the end, it was a pretty entertaining movie
/m/halloween_party_2020	41418fe4-8a1f-30e0-9b60-07c5d937510e	3	Movie didn't do much but love the two lead actors, they were engaging.
/m/halloween_party_2020	41418fe4-8a1f-30e0-9b60-07c5d937510e	2	I'm not sure what I just saw, but it definitely wasn't good, especially the last act, which made almost no sense. The first two thirds was pretty good, as far as it went, and Amy Groening is just about the hottest woman on the planet, so that doesn't hurt, but the writing is seriously lacking at the end. It just becomes a rote horror... something. Not funny, not scary, not much of anything.
/m/halloween_party_2020	41418fe4-8a1f-30e0-9b60-07c5d937510e	2	As the movie progressed it got more and more dragging. Same repeated scare and happy that the ending arrived.
/m/ashfall	d625ad67-33e3-3c2a-b330-88b7b342d3b7	0.5	A sorry excuse for a disaster movie and a poor attempt at mimicing Hollywood. It seems to tick all the standard boxes with visual effects, plot, acting, etc. Yet it is also somehow utterly ridiculous because it somehow strongly reminds a comedy made by Jackie Chan. The special forces group and its leader look like a bunch of clowns. I am sure this is how koreans see the genre, like a gameshow with goofy characters. In sum, do not waste time and money unless you want to do exacrly this.
/m/ashfall	d625ad67-33e3-3c2a-b330-88b7b342d3b7	5	If you're looking for an edge of your set action film, with just enough humor to ease the tension... this one's for you. Fun, funny, exciting and well executed. A joy to watch!
/m/ashfall	d625ad67-33e3-3c2a-b330-88b7b342d3b7	5	A wonderful blockbuster. I laughed so much at Lee Byung Hun & Ha Jung Woo's bromance, Suzy and Don Lee's Bus scene and i loved the cinematography.
/m/ashfall	d625ad67-33e3-3c2a-b330-88b7b342d3b7	5	The movie was really good, tear jerking and always good to see Lee Byung-hun back on the screen. The banter between the lead and Byung Hun is really good and funny. Quite the camaraderie.

/m/ashfall	d625ad67-33e3-3c2a-b330-88b7b342d3b7	3.5	Great CG effects.  Solid acting by accomplished actors. Typical world-destruction storyline.
/m/the_glorias	131282af-55c9-4b2e-9888-265f94048568	3	Bette Midler is in this.
/m/the_glorias	131282af-55c9-4b2e-9888-265f94048568	4.5	Julie Taymor brings an artistic vision of an empowering woman with great direction I'm on her part and acting on all the Gloria actresses' parts.
/m/the_glorias	131282af-55c9-4b2e-9888-265f94048568	5	So important. I recommend this to everyone. It's educational and inspiring.
/m/the_glorias	131282af-55c9-4b2e-9888-265f94048568	5	This is a reflective movie of a woman during her lifetime where she is still trying to figure or has figured out who she is both from a personal and social viewpoint.  Although this movie is about Ms. Steim's life, it leaves this impression of what womanhood is defined as. no matter race, gender, sexuality and more!
/m/the_glorias	131282af-55c9-4b2e-9888-265f94048568	4	Excellent telling of the story of a woman and a movement that changed the world.
/m/the_glorias	131282af-55c9-4b2e-9888-265f94048568	5	This is one of the best movies I saw for a while, a very relevant movie today.  It's great the director and movie put women's right, black right, native American, Asian American, gay rights all together, it's human's right! It's a much holistic way to look at things, and what's going on today in the world.  Julian Moore's speech at Catholic church is the most touching one, how in human history, men gradually alienate from nature, but make the church more isolated from nature and built hierarchy with white male God as the image, all the important female figures all became background. I believe in women's movement and the pro-choice. I can't believe it is still being discussed today.  Human has the choice for his/her life, as long he/her is responsible for the the choice he/she made, no one should tell him/her otherwise. That is basic human right! I can't believe the low rating the movie gets. It's the message it's carry that's way more important than the format itself. Do u all get the messages?
/m/the_glorias	131282af-55c9-4b2e-9888-265f94048568	2	This was not a movie, it was a pamphlet. (And I am a feminist and liberal and I actually stand behind everything that was in the film). Looked good, actors were great (although the accent Vikander did was weird) and the Wizard of Oz scene was great. I learned a lot about Steinem, so that's a good thing. But it was a badly edited cliff notes version of Steinhem's life with exposition instead of dialogue.
/m/the_glorias	131282af-55c9-4b2e-9888-265f94048568	2	The Glorias has good intentions but is an overlong mess. The acting was great. Julianne Moore and Alicia Vikander were both very solid. I like the idea of having Gloria Steinem being portrayed by four different actresses. The execution of it is hit and miss. I liked the scenes where the different Glorias interacted with each other. There are also some nice visual flourishes courtesy of director Julia Taymor. But the film doesn’t always know how to balance all 4 performances. The first hour or so goes back and forth and is a mess. The second half becomes more focused, but not enough to make me give this a positive review. The film is also nearly two and a half hours long. Many scenes drag and run on for two long. Overall, I get the ambition, but the execution was pretty lackluster. The film was a disappointing mess. Moore, Vikander, and Steinem deserve better.
/m/the_glorias	131282af-55c9-4b2e-9888-265f94048568	5	Julie Taymor is a master storyteller and always finds a new way to tell her story with creative visual surprises. It was also a treat to see Bette Midler play Bella Abzug.
/m/the_glorias	131282af-55c9-4b2e-9888-265f94048568	4.5	Good movie, very informative about the womens movement, shows many ethnicities join together united for equality. 🙋😃
/m/scare_me	5e74e188-9da4-4ef4-b2f3-65015690b32d	4	Really fun, definitely not scary but really worth watching. I did leave wondering which side of this drama is Director Josh Ruben on. Maybe we're all just complex being regardless of our skin colour or gender.
/m/scare_me	5e74e188-9da4-4ef4-b2f3-65015690b32d	5	I love this movie! Definitely different and that's what makes it so good. A fun horror movie.
/m/scare_me	5e74e188-9da4-4ef4-b2f3-65015690b32d	0.5	The only thing "horror" about this movie is spending the full runtime watching it instead of doing literally anything else. These characters were the most annoying I've ever seen in a movie.
/m/scare_me	5e74e188-9da4-4ef4-b2f3-65015690b32d	2	Annoyingly corny. I thought it was going to be much different.
/m/scare_me	5e74e188-9da4-4ef4-b2f3-65015690b32d	3	Scare Me was better than I expected. I was hoping for a little more of an ending and less run time. For anyone that gives this a shot,go in with an open mind.
/m/scare_me	5e74e188-9da4-4ef4-b2f3-65015690b32d	1	Two actors talk a lot in a room and really ham it up. They are apparently later joined by a third actor, but I couldn't make it that far. If I want a paucity of actors spiting dialogue the entire film I'll go with Hard Candy or Locke, not this crap.
/m/scare_me	5e74e188-9da4-4ef4-b2f3-65015690b32d	3	This is the most Marmite film I've seen for a while. I think you probably have to judge this on it's own terms as an experimental genre piece.  On the up side, I will say that it kept me interested until the end, it was creatively made, very well acted, and genuinely quite entertaining in parts.  However, it does feel like several sketch pieces cobbled together. It's both hipster fodder and fan service. It's like it's trying to be some kind of theatre piece disguised in the body of a small horror film. You could almost describe this as an avant-garde horror anthology.  But actually I think I quite liked this for at least having the guts to take a slightly different spin on the horror genre and pop culture.  3 out of 5
/m/scare_me	5e74e188-9da4-4ef4-b2f3-65015690b32d	5	I went into this movie not expecting much ( I mean c'mon- how exciting can a movie be about a couple of people sitting around a cabin with the power out telling scary stories be ? ) but I must say I was pleasantly surprised! Started out a little slow but very quickly had me feeling like I was right there in the cabin with them as well as laughing at the occasional witty banter back and forth. Very good cast, they all work very well together. Nice twist at the end. If you are looking for a very scary supernatural thriller or gorefest this may not be the movie for you, but if you are into horror comedy check it out- you will be very glad you did!
/m/scare_me	5e74e188-9da4-4ef4-b2f3-65015690b32d	3.5	Aya Cash steals every part of this film. Between this and The Boys, her star is clearly on the rise. Whippy dialogue, creative storytelling and a claustrophobic setting make this standard horror fare taste a little sweeter than similar "scary story" films. 7/10
/m/scare_me	5e74e188-9da4-4ef4-b2f3-65015690b32d	1.5	If this was the Gong Show, it wouldn't have lasted very long.  'Scare Me' is one of those comedic horror films which isn't funny or scary, but it's in focus, so there's that.  It also has a pretty nifty ending.  There is so much down time during the cabin scenes and since that's 95% of the film it's a hard one to recommend!  Final Score: 3/10
/m/save_yourselves	298f9ff2-211d-4f28-827e-6e6a039aaef0	5	funny, unpredictable and fun
/m/save_yourselves	298f9ff2-211d-4f28-827e-6e6a039aaef0	3	Looses points for the ending, it was pretty funny and enjoyable up until that point.
/m/save_yourselves	298f9ff2-211d-4f28-827e-6e6a039aaef0	2	Alrighty!  Love the actor and actress, the movie was very promising, but left you with a sour, "artistically meh" taste in your mouth that only an alien Pouffe could produce.  So tired of these Hollywood movies that "leave it to the audience".  This movie is much like the downtown art critics that eat at terrible restaurants so they can talk about it on Monday morning by the espresso machine "You ate where this weekend?  Cockroach Danny's?  I heard they charge $600.00 for a cockroach head souffle?  How absolutely divine darling!"  People say they like this ending so they too, can sound sophisticated... The ending was garbage, like real garbage that hangs on a fancy, New York art gallery wall at 1.5 million, containing real human feces.  "It's art Jenna, and me and Stephan have to have it having above our dinner table!  We'll be the talk of the town".  Such promise, only to deliver a lukewarm meal, that lacks any true substance before and after the credits roll.
/m/save_yourselves	298f9ff2-211d-4f28-827e-6e6a039aaef0	2	A not funny comedy with a dumb ending.  Some social commentary about relationships & how our everyday problems aren't such a big deal, I guess.  Did I mention the dumb ending that felt like a lazy writing cop-out?
/m/save_yourselves	298f9ff2-211d-4f28-827e-6e6a039aaef0	4.5	Delightfully wacky, quirky and loaded with charm, Save Yourselves! accomplishes a lot with very little. We follow the lives of millennial couple, Jack and Su, played by John Paul Reynolds and Sunita Mani respectively, as they attempt to disconnect from the cyberworld for a week in a remote cabin in the countryside. Prior to their departure, we are shown what their day-to-day lives look like and, speaking for the millennial generation, it is, shamefully, all too familiar. (Nights spent sitting silently side by side on the couch, scrolling through social media, take-out containers littering the coffee table... Sound familiar to anyone else)? The chemistry between our two leads is undeniable and delightful, and once they make their trek from New York City out to the New York countryside, we are treated to even more delicious helpings of their fantastic relationship dynamic. While we are shown a believable range of emotions between the two, never is the boundary line of cringe breached, thankfully. Despite it being a film about an impending apocalypse, it remains purely comedy until the final 15 to 20min. At a runtime of 90min, those 75min of comedy and storytelling are pure gold. Much of the comedy we enjoy is derived from the change of scenery from city to countryside and our characters simply trying to adapt to being so out of place, (including their borderline incompetence in traditional gender roles). In truth, both actors are simply so damn likeable, your laughing muscles are likely primed for contraction without you even realizing it. So when they act on impulse, simply doing or saying what we know their characters probably really would do or say, it's laugh-out-loud perfection--comedy at its best. One recurring joke in particular, regarding Reynolds' character Jack, in which we are shown the effects of his sleep abnormality, never stops being funny. Additionally, the comedic element is masterfully elevated by Andrew Orkin's goofy score. Certain scenes, could have easily been misconstrued as suspenseful, and maybe for our characters, they are; but we as the audience are likely to be laughing throughout these sequences, thanks to Orkin. Still other scenes where the score shines through, are in sudden, brief moments that are equivalent to a less painful episode of "You hit my funny bone," or perhaps, more similar to a baby's reaction when Jack (not Reynolds' Jack) pops out of his box? Either way, they catch you off guard in the best way, leaving you laughing in unadulterated delight. As the film moves into its final act, you won't know what to expect. Surely, there can only be one possible outcome right? Wrong. And before you even get there, there's an unexpected curveball. As for the end, you won't see it coming. Those who have already seen the film are likely divided on whether they found the ending fitting or not. Though it's safe to say, it's interpretable and open for discussion, which many of the best films are.

/m/save_yourselves	298f9ff2-211d-4f28-827e-6e6a039aaef0	0.5	Insufferable main characters. It's as if Jordan Peele made a movie about hipsters but was very bad at writing and didn't care at all. Was that supposed to be a comedy? Satire? Beyond stupid. Don't waste tour time.
/m/save_yourselves	298f9ff2-211d-4f28-827e-6e6a039aaef0	1.5	Horrible ending, unnecessary parts, though a good story and plot. Didn't really have much humor as it claims to be humorous, and didn't have as many science fiction elements as I would have liked.
/m/a_call_to_spy	0c81b89e-a66f-347b-a7d7-fe57ca83b157	4	A really well done movie. It's a historic film about British efforts to create spy networks in France during WWII. It's based on real people and I think they do a good job portraying the events. It's a decently long movie and it is pretty slow, but I think it's the perfect speed for what it is. A great movie to watch if you like historic movies especially about WWII.
/m/a_call_to_spy	0c81b89e-a66f-347b-a7d7-fe57ca83b157	4	This deserving movie brings to life a time and story that is convincing and always thoughtful. Writer, producer, star, Sarah Meagan Thomas (Backwards '12) proves her worth as a seriously talented creative force and is to be applauded for this heartfelt effort.  Without sensationalizing she tells of the harrowing fact-based trials and brave achievements, of these praiseworthy women - who risked it all for their country and ideals within the WW11 Special Operations Executive (also exposes some unforgivable collaborators whose vile betrayals should not be forgotten)    It's good-looking, well-produced, acted, and directed by prolific producer Lydia Dean Pilcher - with sterling contributions from all involved.  Those interested in the history of these troubled times should not be disappointed.
/m/a_call_to_spy	0c81b89e-a66f-347b-a7d7-fe57ca83b157	3	Es una película decente que pudo haber sido mucho mejor; las actuaciones son buenas y la trama es interesante; la historia de las mujeres espías merece más reconocimiento.
/m/a_call_to_spy	0c81b89e-a66f-347b-a7d7-fe57ca83b157	4.5	esta película es sorprendente donde narra a héroes de la segunda guerra mundial que han sido pasado por alto
/m/a_call_to_spy	0c81b89e-a66f-347b-a7d7-fe57ca83b157	4	Good movie. Those who like historic films will enjoy it for sure.
/m/a_call_to_spy	0c81b89e-a66f-347b-a7d7-fe57ca83b157	5	WHAT A TELLING OF A TRUE STORY, UNKNOWN CAST SUPERB. HONEST TELLING OF BRITSH 'WINS' AND TERRIBLE ESPIONAGE MISTAKES RESULTING IN DEATHS TO OUR SIDE. THE POSTSCRIPT OF WHAT THE ACTUAL PEOPLE ACCOMPLISHED AFTER THE WAR IS MORE ASTOUNDING THAN WHAT THE VIEWER HAS JUST WATCHED. A WONDERFUL UNKNOWN (TO ME) GEM.
/m/a_call_to_spy	0c81b89e-a66f-347b-a7d7-fe57ca83b157	5	Amazing true life story of real heros. Why didn't this get more publicity and higher ratings. I guess because it's not based on Marvel Comics fake, superficial heros.
/m/a_call_to_spy	0c81b89e-a66f-347b-a7d7-fe57ca83b157	3.5	gripping truelife spy drama
/m/a_call_to_spy	0c81b89e-a66f-347b-a7d7-fe57ca83b157	3.5	Based on real events, A Call to Spy is better than the title suggests. Multiple strong female performances bring this movie into the spotlight. Radhika Apte's portrayal of Noor will make you start feeling your long lost emotions again. But if you want to see some good acting by Samuel Roukin, keep looking. The unsung story of these brave women needed to be told, and the result is a film you'll want to watch once.
/m/a_call_to_spy	0c81b89e-a66f-347b-a7d7-fe57ca83b157	5	A thought provoking and insightful movie about British spy activity in France. Definitely recommended- the best movie I have watched in a while!
/m/12_hour_shift	57ef9866-3f1b-4e7a-8287-71964050dab7	3.5	I didn't realize it was a comedy & Thriller movie so I wasn't super happy at first but as the movie developed it turned into a rather entertaining movie. Not only were the characters well written and like able. It was a chaotic yet hilarious ride to pass the time.
/m/12_hour_shift	57ef9866-3f1b-4e7a-8287-71964050dab7	5	Absolutely fantastic. It kept me engaged in ways I didn't think possible. Every character feels too real and too crazily insane at the same time. It's hard not to identify with Mandy even if your life is not big much of a mess. This film was written with the kind of sensibility only a woman can have towards certain subjects. 'Show don't tell' done very well.
/m/12_hour_shift	57ef9866-3f1b-4e7a-8287-71964050dab7	5	Solid performances, spectacular soundtrack and a crazy ass plot make this one of the best movies I've ever seen. If you're into black comedy, you may od on this.
/m/12_hour_shift	57ef9866-3f1b-4e7a-8287-71964050dab7	4	Funny, ridiculous, and super enjoyable! Plenty of action, not too much gore, and the characters are perfectly wacky. Not too dark where it's depressing - just dark enough. I definitely recommend.
/m/12_hour_shift	57ef9866-3f1b-4e7a-8287-71964050dab7	3.5	i'd call it an over-the-top black comedy.... very enjoyable.
/m/12_hour_shift	57ef9866-3f1b-4e7a-8287-71964050dab7	3.5	the music is fantastic and the location of the movie was great but they could have added more
/m/12_hour_shift	57ef9866-3f1b-4e7a-8287-71964050dab7	3.5	Brea Grant has crafted such a fun storyline and filled with a great mix of characters in for the most, the limited location of a hospital, the film never, not even for a second, feels like its limited by that..  The cast are wonderful including a cool role for David Arquette as a handcuffed convict brought into the hospital by a somewhat amateur security guard and Julianne Dowler as the troublemaking Cathy..  But its Angela Bettis in the main role of Mandy that is the onscreen star of 12 Hour Shift as she struggles to keep herself going through this insane shift at her job. Stealing medication from patients seems to be the only way she can get through the half a day shift.  Please do check out 12 Hour Shift, You can thank me later for the recommendation
/m/12_hour_shift	57ef9866-3f1b-4e7a-8287-71964050dab7	3.5	The music was fantastic and the location this movie takes place is also an amazing idea although i would have preferred to see more stuff happen
/m/12_hour_shift	57ef9866-3f1b-4e7a-8287-71964050dab7	5	Great. Really charming. More comedy than horror.
/m/12_hour_shift	57ef9866-3f1b-4e7a-8287-71964050dab7	3	12 Hour Shift is an offbeat dark comedy that mostly works. I really liked all of the performances here. Angela Bettis was great in the lead role, as was Chloe Farnworth on her supporting role. The film has a strange tone that mostly works. The dark comedy is hit or miss, but when it hits it really hits. The gore is also well done, and the plot keeps you engaged for the most part. Overall, I liked this. It’s far from perfect but it’s pretty enjoyable. I recommend checking it out.
/m/the_ringmaster	4f231f3d-fc0e-432d-b48b-334cfb892bea	4.5	This is a unique doc about addiction, aging, and documenting a reluctant subject. Worth a watch!
/m/the_ringmaster	4f231f3d-fc0e-432d-b48b-334cfb892bea	5	A brilliant cautionary tale
/m/the_ringmaster	4f231f3d-fc0e-432d-b48b-334cfb892bea	5	A powerful film about an addict trying to change a simple mans life. I highly recommend everyone see this especially aspiring filmmakers.
/m/the_ringmaster	4f231f3d-fc0e-432d-b48b-334cfb892bea	0.5	Total exploitation of a man with Alzheimer's disease. By watching this movie, you are donating to his exploiters. The release of this movie is merely a shameless attempt by the main antagonist (the producer) to recoup his losses in making the project.
/m/the_ringmaster	4f231f3d-fc0e-432d-b48b-334cfb892bea	1	Having worked with Alzheimers/dementia patients before, seeing a group of people rattle the brain of, steadily expedite the process of, and profit from someones' mental deterioration is pretty disgusting. Really wish this film received more criticism for what it is - it's not only a film about a filmmaker poorly trying to fit a story to an unwilling subject, it's active terrorism on someone's life to fit a wealthy few's "vision." If you want to be grossed out by rich people being so obsessed with themselves they can't see that a man is truly hurting around them, then watch it.  A sickening watch.
/m/the_ringmaster	4f231f3d-fc0e-432d-b48b-334cfb892bea	4	A unique study of ethics in filmmaking that is full of heart and quirky characters. A genre bending experience. If you're tired of predictable stories then watch this!
/m/the_ringmaster	4f231f3d-fc0e-432d-b48b-334cfb892bea	5	A fresh documentary with unexpected twists and turns
/m/the_ringmaster	4f231f3d-fc0e-432d-b48b-334cfb892bea	3.5	A memorable doc about a failed doc. A meta experience that is emotionally resonant.
/m/the_ringmaster	4f231f3d-fc0e-432d-b48b-334cfb892bea	4.5	Wasn't sure what to expect with this film but it is fascinating. The story morphs and has its cringeworthy moments but those balance out with humor and a ton of heart from the people in the film.
/m/the_ringmaster	4f231f3d-fc0e-432d-b48b-334cfb892bea	5	My family grew up visiting this area in Southwest Minnesota where the famous onion rings are from and we all thought the documentary was a touching tribute to a true Minnesota legend. Compelling and heartbreaking. We were on the edge of our seats for 88 minutes. It is an emotional film that will leave you thinking for sure. I laughed, I cried and I felt deeply for all the characters. We were saddened to hear that Larry recently passed away but we're glad to hear that he had a chance to see the film in a sold out theater before the pandemic. This documentary ensures that his legacy will live on and I hope the rings become available again one day because they really are as good as everyone says in the movie.
/m/jimmy_carter_rock_and_roll_president	9b597ab2-d2c3-4e27-9a0d-e35adf8e4829	1.5	Not sure what was so good, especially since I was around during that time and saw inflation skyrocket and 2 neighbors lose their homes among other things.
/m/jimmy_carter_rock_and_roll_president	9b597ab2-d2c3-4e27-9a0d-e35adf8e4829	4.5	I think there are a few things that are clear about Jimmy Carter.   1.  He is a very good human being.   2.  His Presidency was marred by problems and has not been viewed in the eye of political history as a successful one.  This movie looks at Carter and his Presidency through the lens of Gospel and Rock N' Roll.  Through looking at the his musical influences and his love of artists like Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Mahalia Jackson, and Greg Allman the film gives a good look at the "soul" of President Carter.   This one is a well made documentary.   Good interviews, with musicians, family, and the man himself.   Terrific news and historic footage from Carter's political ascension in Georgia and beyond.    The film does a good job of looking at Carter's life against the backdrop of racial segregation and prejudice Carter grew up and succeeded against.  This one is worthwhile for history buffs, musics buffs, and documentary buffs.   I liked it a lot.
/m/jimmy_carter_rock_and_roll_president	9b597ab2-d2c3-4e27-9a0d-e35adf8e4829	5	I loved this documentary. It's great! He was the President in my college years and the first I voted for. That being said, I was unaware of most of the story, even though I knew almost everyone involved. The variety of musicians from every music genre surprised me from Johnny Cash, Dizzy Gillespie, Paul Simon, Aretha, the Allmans to Bono, Loretta Lynn, Jimmy Buffet and more. What a contrast of integrity and compassion between the 39th & 46th POTUS. He may not have been the best President, but IMHO, he's the best person who was President.
/m/jimmy_carter_rock_and_roll_president	9b597ab2-d2c3-4e27-9a0d-e35adf8e4829	5	Loved it. Our greatest President and perhaps our greatest human being. A wonderful documentary detailing life before being liberal became an ironically negative word. Thank you CNN films.
/m/jimmy_carter_rock_and_roll_president	9b597ab2-d2c3-4e27-9a0d-e35adf8e4829	5	Jimmy Carter Rock and Roll President healed my soul.  To see a president who really cared about our country and our culture, and who you could trust to tell the truth was like a breath of fresh air.  The music performances were outstanding, and to discover President Carter's love of music was really a surprise.  The new interviews of a whole host of who's who were outstanding.  And the background score was perfect.  Cudo's to director Mary Wharton and to her whole crew!
/m/jimmy_carter_rock_and_roll_president	9b597ab2-d2c3-4e27-9a0d-e35adf8e4829	5	Loved, loved, loved this movie. I had no idea the connections and friendships between the Carters and some of my all time favorite musicians. Such a refreshing watch in these weird times.
/m/jimmy_carter_rock_and_roll_president	9b597ab2-d2c3-4e27-9a0d-e35adf8e4829	5	At the time, I was too young to pay much attention to politics or social events in my country.  In addition to being reminded how great a Humanitarian Jimmy Carter is, I was impressed by how strong Rosalyn Carter was.  I did not recall her in such a way.  I also enjoyed the music history related to Jimmy Carter at the time.  This documentary was enjoyable and informative we loved it!
/m/jimmy_carter_rock_and_roll_president	9b597ab2-d2c3-4e27-9a0d-e35adf8e4829	5	Great storytelling presenting so much I didnt know about President Carter. What a great film!!
/m/from_the_vine	24ed8958-5a3a-3348-8014-f9b7436ceec4	3	An uncomplicated, unpretentious romp in Italy. But it has that all important ‘feel good' about it, so a thumbs up.
/m/from_the_vine	24ed8958-5a3a-3348-8014-f9b7436ceec4	3.5	A cute and quirky movie - particularly lovely if you've visited rural Italy and those typical rambling vineyards! A few odd glitches in the generally smooth flow of storytelling, but most of the time kept my interest and I enjoyed it. Some characters were not well-rounded or fully believable at times, while others were just rather unlikeable (when I am pretty sure we were supposed to like them!) but really that is just picking out the holes. It IS far-fetched, but it is also a fun and heart-warming romantic comedy. I saw it at the cinema and will watch it again when it comes to a streaming platform.
/m/from_the_vine	24ed8958-5a3a-3348-8014-f9b7436ceec4	5	Once again, it's about ENTERTAINMENT, people. This movie was completely feel-good. Funny all the way through, with no embarrassing sex scenes or violence. For those of you who love that sort of thing, definitely skip this movie. But this was definitely a bar-above the typical feel-good/nothing going on here movie. Funny all the way through -- be sure to pay attention to the inanimate objects that talk to Marco throughout -- and you will certainly enjoy the great characters (Enzo!) and a loving family. Views of the italian countryside are worth watching all by themselves! Highly recommend!
/m/from_the_vine	24ed8958-5a3a-3348-8014-f9b7436ceec4	4	I needed a feel good movie & this was it. It’s corny & somewhat predictable, but you can’t beat the beautiful Italian countryside, winemaking, & romance all wrapped up in a solid story. Enjoy!
/m/from_the_vine	24ed8958-5a3a-3348-8014-f9b7436ceec4	4.5	LOVE IT!!! BEST MOVIE IN YEARS!!!!
/m/from_the_vine	24ed8958-5a3a-3348-8014-f9b7436ceec4	5	Beautiful, delicate and proactive full of values : friendship hard work, commitment vision and above all love. I wish there could  be more films like this
/m/from_the_vine	24ed8958-5a3a-3348-8014-f9b7436ceec4	4	This is not a four star movie, but for me, the dream is what sold me.  There were some weak transitions and some characters were off, but it was quite enjoyable.  Acerenza is beautiful and the characters portrayed in the town were characters for sure.
/m/from_the_vine	24ed8958-5a3a-3348-8014-f9b7436ceec4	5	It was recommended by prime streaming service to me. I was surprised how nice, entertaining,  sweet and simple this film was.  No identity politics,  no woke garbage.  A beautiful story,  simple family friendly.  No drugs, no violence.  A type of movie Hollywood can no longer make,  because their heads are all up their own rear ends.  I highly recommend.
/m/from_the_vine	24ed8958-5a3a-3348-8014-f9b7436ceec4	0.5	The only good thing in this movie is the landscape. It shocked me to see how highly this movie was rated by most of the expert reviewers.
/m/from_the_vine	24ed8958-5a3a-3348-8014-f9b7436ceec4	3.5	A nice story with a predictable ending but entertaining none the less. A feel good movie with good acting and great scenery of the Italian countryside. I also found it pretty amusing at times.
/m/death_of_me	bfe76b0e-d7cd-4411-aa4a-c36a3c93236a	2	ehhh; i like the premise, but i don't know that it was executed real well... they didn't really explain anything so it sort of felt like just a bunch of random scenes stitched together. idk. i don't think i'd recommend it.
/m/death_of_me	bfe76b0e-d7cd-4411-aa4a-c36a3c93236a	2.5	2.5/5.  Mildly entertaining, but it's just a rip off of The Wicker Man.
/m/death_of_me	bfe76b0e-d7cd-4411-aa4a-c36a3c93236a	0.5	Beautiful opening shots that promise so much, to dissolve into utter nonsense. I think this is the reason we've never seen the other Hemsworth brother.
/m/death_of_me	bfe76b0e-d7cd-4411-aa4a-c36a3c93236a	2	The movie starts interesting enough but it gets lost in a sea of real/not real situations, the atmosphere the movie creates something lacks of intensity and falls flat, I mean, I am sure the native could be more convincing and better skilled at those masks, most of the time it looks like they are just prancing around, to many things are left unexplained and it's just gets too boring and weird but not in a good way.
/m/death_of_me	bfe76b0e-d7cd-4411-aa4a-c36a3c93236a	0.5	There's a scene where Luke Hemsworth randomly disappears mid-sentence. Maggie Q looks around and says, "Where are you?" and he just walks up behind her and says, "I'm right here." And the movie plays jump scare music like "haha got'cha!" But I'm like what is even happening. Why did he disappear. Why was him walking up behind her supposed to be scary. What.
/m/death_of_me	bfe76b0e-d7cd-4411-aa4a-c36a3c93236a	1.5	Mildly entertaining. But don't recommend
/m/death_of_me	bfe76b0e-d7cd-4411-aa4a-c36a3c93236a	2.5	Goes for creepy human sacrifice thing, explains little, does not explain. Meh.
/m/death_of_me	bfe76b0e-d7cd-4411-aa4a-c36a3c93236a	3	Beautiful and colorful location filming in Thailand alone make Death of Me a worthwhile view.  Maggie Q and Luke Hemsworth are also good as a couple vacationing in Thailand who lose track of time after partaking in the local scene.  Be patient since the story ties together loose ends in the final act.  I enjoyed it.
/m/death_of_me	bfe76b0e-d7cd-4411-aa4a-c36a3c93236a	2	Not unwatchable but not enjoyable either. I'd skip it if I had something better to watch.
/m/death_of_me	bfe76b0e-d7cd-4411-aa4a-c36a3c93236a	2.5	There an intriguing mystery going on throughout, but ultimately it's pretty short on scares or real tension. There's a couple decent twists though. The real mystery is how both leads aren't more famous than they are. They're both great.
/m/the_curse_of_audrey_earnshaw	e6b73b66-dec1-4135-b73d-cf102c84b9d7	0.5	A failure to lay even the most basic background resulted in what was at best a mediocre B-movie. Even the acting couldn't save this schizophrenic storyline. Looking at the comments from the critics I wonder did they even watch the movie?
/m/the_curse_of_audrey_earnshaw	e6b73b66-dec1-4135-b73d-cf102c84b9d7	0.5	It was so slow and pathetic. Boring
/m/the_curse_of_audrey_earnshaw	e6b73b66-dec1-4135-b73d-cf102c84b9d7	4	Thightly constructed Folk Horror, a strange tale that mixes rigourous anachronistic christians and paganism, but in a way that feels out of time. This movie is not afraid to move along, the tale doesn thold back it's punches and it takes advantage of many different avenues, it is suprising how much happens in such a short time and how much it makes sense, because it trusts the watcher to keep up. It may be a very old story to the point of being a horror trope but it is definitely approached differently and with gusto.
/m/the_curse_of_audrey_earnshaw	e6b73b66-dec1-4135-b73d-cf102c84b9d7	4	Atmospheric and reminiscent of " The VVitch," although much more straightforward. There's a creeping dread, punctuated by moments of sudden violence. There's a theme of sacrifice and coming of age, sort of? The ending is ambiguous, and it suits the story. Overall a solid effort, with a very convincing performance by Jessica Reynolds as the title character.
/m/the_curse_of_audrey_earnshaw	e6b73b66-dec1-4135-b73d-cf102c84b9d7	0.5	This movie got good images, but it goes so extremely slow. It is also not scary at all.
/m/the_curse_of_audrey_earnshaw	e6b73b66-dec1-4135-b73d-cf102c84b9d7	3.5	Actually pretty darn good.
/m/the_curse_of_audrey_earnshaw	e6b73b66-dec1-4135-b73d-cf102c84b9d7	3	OK, where do I start? How About I start of with the good news, Casting did a good job, Wardrobe was great, cinematography, location and post production colouring as well as score were spot on. The movie itself however was something else entirely (think"The witch 2015" meets "Rosemary's baby 1968" in a back alley to buy Meth from the "The village 2004"), metaphorically it was like watching a giant Cadillac drive around a derelict Amish neighbourhood slowly filling its spacious trunk  with writhing, groaning dead and living victims while simultaneously scoping out the "witch riddled" countryside for a judicious spot to dispose of the trunk's contents in a satisfactorily plot-worthy manner. Sadly the  director or editor fails to find a situation or explanation adequate to the task. You can sense the director's increasingly vexing struggle to bring this thing home without resorting to Hackneyed satanic lore and the palpable deflation when the editor simply run out of rope, cash or ideas. So as the credits roll up in the end we are left staring at the taillights  on the metaphorical idling Caddy and listening to the shuffling and weak groans emanating from the partially locked trunk. In desperation for closure you feel certain that somethings going to bust out at any moment and resolve at least a few of the numerous beautifully crafted and, as yet, unresolved plot lines that the story successfully spun up, but sadly nothing like that actually comes to pass.  So like many movie viewers this year you are left thinking, "Oh well, at least the scenery was pretty and the actors didn't stink", and sadly these days that's saying a lot.
/m/the_curse_of_audrey_earnshaw	e6b73b66-dec1-4135-b73d-cf102c84b9d7	3	MInor gothic horror action
/m/the_curse_of_audrey_earnshaw	e6b73b66-dec1-4135-b73d-cf102c84b9d7	0.5	Double, Double Toil & Trouble.......  Fire burn and caldron bubble. If you enjoy this your mind must be rubble. Your walls of reality starting to tumble. Make haste at once, get away from this stumble. Before you're turned into an irritating nubble.  Yet another entry to the 'make it up as you go along' genre. The only curse is the one that stole 90 minutes of your lifeforce. No room on this broom, or cats or bats or hats - call yourself a witch indeed
/m/the_curse_of_audrey_earnshaw	e6b73b66-dec1-4135-b73d-cf102c84b9d7	5	Loved this movie. Slow paced, creepy, witchcraft, gore, and great acting! Folklore horror is one of my favorite genres!
/m/spontaneous	eb9ad3eb-a674-333b-a0e4-d9904a79742d	4.5	Funny, unusual and refreshing are the words I would use to describe this movie. Charlie Plummer is definitely a rising star loaded with talent to perform. The premise will be a challenge for some closed minded viewers, but I believe that it is funny and sometimes scary enough to convince. It deserves an opportunity. It is rare nowadays to watch new original content with quality.
/m/spontaneous	eb9ad3eb-a674-333b-a0e4-d9904a79742d	2.5	Kinda boring. Forgot about it pretty quickly. Hate twinky men.
/m/spontaneous	eb9ad3eb-a674-333b-a0e4-d9904a79742d	3.5	Very unique and dark teen romance.
/m/spontaneous	eb9ad3eb-a674-333b-a0e4-d9904a79742d	5	Good movie, lots of suspense.  Lots of blood but not too gory.   Lots of very funny parts.
/m/spontaneous	eb9ad3eb-a674-333b-a0e4-d9904a79742d	4	"Spontaneous" is an explosive comedy-drama, with a great screenplay and some sweet and powerful moments. Simple but effective!
/m/spontaneous	eb9ad3eb-a674-333b-a0e4-d9904a79742d	5	This movie was surprisingly really good. It was much heavier than I thought it would be.
/m/spontaneous	eb9ad3eb-a674-333b-a0e4-d9904a79742d	4.5	I loved this movie so much that I just got finished watching it and rushed over to my computer to tell you this, it's an amazing movie full of human interactions and of course the science fiction part of this movie about spontaneous combustion in a school only!!!!!
/m/spontaneous	eb9ad3eb-a674-333b-a0e4-d9904a79742d	5	An interesting way to think about the meaning of life, and a touching hidden social critique.
/m/spontaneous	eb9ad3eb-a674-333b-a0e4-d9904a79742d	2	Premise of plot was good but they sidelined it and went gun glazing on philosophy on life. Witty dialogues and editing helped with dark comedy. I've always against the normal guy went on to save the day type of plot. I'm okay with not explaining the reason and solving that but they didn't explore the horrible death children, emotions of parents, friendship of Mara or anything Katherine Langford and School make unique combo. Mara, quirky girl is fun to watch, the spontaneous scenes, except those there's nothing much in this film.
/m/spontaneous	eb9ad3eb-a674-333b-a0e4-d9904a79742d	4	Funny, but with a lesson for these days of Covid pandemic.
/m/hosts	6ef2ba81-bc04-4e6f-a291-96976e2f3a7a	1	his was so boring & i wasn't invested enough to continue watching. so I didn't. i did walk back into the room during a gnarly stabbing scene, but even then I didn't stick around to see what happened after. idk. I'm sure it was fine, but wasn't in the mood I guess.
/m/hosts	6ef2ba81-bc04-4e6f-a291-96976e2f3a7a	2	Starts out great, then just becomes boring and stupid.
/m/hosts	6ef2ba81-bc04-4e6f-a291-96976e2f3a7a	4	This movie was so weird but so dope. I had fun. Would reccomend.
/m/hosts	6ef2ba81-bc04-4e6f-a291-96976e2f3a7a	0.5	I watched this because rotten tomatoes gave it a good rating but after about 30 minutes of this ridiculous laughable crap I could watch no more. Absolutely stupid tacky failed attempt at horror.
/m/hosts	6ef2ba81-bc04-4e6f-a291-96976e2f3a7a	1	Just hammers away malicously.
/m/hosts	6ef2ba81-bc04-4e6f-a291-96976e2f3a7a	3.5	With how strong it starts out, I can't help but feel a bit let down by Hosts. The first 45 minutes had me completely drawn in to the horrid mystery at play, but I was back to rolling my eyes before the credits rolled. Still, for seasonal horror you could do far worse than Hosts.
/m/hosts	6ef2ba81-bc04-4e6f-a291-96976e2f3a7a	0.5	Tragic. Tragic. Tragic.
/m/hosts	6ef2ba81-bc04-4e6f-a291-96976e2f3a7a	4.5	My wife and I watched this movie together and honestly for a minimal budget movie, it was quite good. There are some downright shocking scenes that were done very well if you're into horror. This movie is filled with tons of tension, anxiety, and some gore. The acting was great and you could see and feel the emotions the characters were going through. The cinematography was also done really well. If you go into this movie with an open mind and knowing this isn't a huge massive production, you should enjoy it.
/m/hosts	6ef2ba81-bc04-4e6f-a291-96976e2f3a7a	0.5	Terrible, had some promise at the beginning despite a lot of practically unintelligible dialogue, and you just shelled out $5 to watch it on Amazon, so you hope, hope it's going to be a smart British (setting at least) horror film and you didn't get suckered by a quick look at fake Rotten Tomatoes scores.  Suckered it was....it goes downhill very quickly and turns into just a bunch of oblivious characters with wooden/juvenile acting.  You don't know whether to laugh because it's so campy, or just shut it off.  We decided to cut our losses, as we didn't want to waste another hour to go along with our already lost $5.  Skip it for sure.
/m/hosts	6ef2ba81-bc04-4e6f-a291-96976e2f3a7a	1.5	The premise was interesting but the acting of the lead actors was pretty horrendous and the actions they take throughout the movie are beyond infuriating. Example- why would you have an incredibly personal conversation with your family at dinner and not acknowledge the strange person sat at the table not eating, not talking and generally acting like a zombie? Don't understand how this got 82% approval on RT?
/m/the_doorman_2020	8b6b87f0-6c11-3ce4-8c51-25741dc982ff	3.5	The wrong person in the wrong place at the wrong time, my favourite kind of genre. Appreciate the good actions, last stand with Broz is less convincing
/m/the_doorman_2020	8b6b87f0-6c11-3ce4-8c51-25741dc982ff	2	This is an action film on Ambien. Ruby Rose is such a charming actress but she doesn't lift this film out of barely being watchable.
/m/the_doorman_2020	8b6b87f0-6c11-3ce4-8c51-25741dc982ff	0.5	Very budget. Montage 1\10. Bad fights. Failures in the plot, for which it is a shame.
/m/the_doorman_2020	8b6b87f0-6c11-3ce4-8c51-25741dc982ff	0.5	No one wanted to be in this film, not even the writer... The main characters can't fight but will win everything from stunt performers whit body's out of Greek myths! It's unwatchable...
/m/the_doorman_2020	8b6b87f0-6c11-3ce4-8c51-25741dc982ff	3	I'm sure this movie was just done for the sake of "Hollywood entertainment." There's one too many scenes that simply cannot be taken too seriously. Definitely a few "OH, yeah right!!" moments, but it wasn't THAT bad. I think there could've been some improvements in the writing, and some of the acting was BRUTAL at best, but overall it was okay for what it was.
/m/the_doorman_2020	8b6b87f0-6c11-3ce4-8c51-25741dc982ff	2	The best way to describe the action scenes are, epileptic cinematography. The scenes jump around, probably to hide the poor choreography. In a side note, it looks cool to shoot a gun one handed but shows you've never shot.
/m/the_doorman_2020	8b6b87f0-6c11-3ce4-8c51-25741dc982ff	2.5	could have been worse. Reno and Rose were good in this but everyone else seemed to treat it like a class play of diehard. Some fairly good action scenes and a nuanced villain but just some bad acting.
/m/the_doorman_2020	8b6b87f0-6c11-3ce4-8c51-25741dc982ff	2	Female Die Hard? Lil Bit.  She's a war vet that gets caught up in a Russian wanting his paintings back - and things get violent with lots of reheated action scenes.
/m/the_doorman_2020	8b6b87f0-6c11-3ce4-8c51-25741dc982ff	3	Overall, it was watchable, but there were some decisions that some of the characters made that were just dumb from a writing standpoint where it looked like the writers were trying to just make the scenes flow to the next.  Very annoying. The fight scenes were ok, but predictable as most of the movie was and this is not a movie I would have paid to see.
/m/the_doorman_2020	8b6b87f0-6c11-3ce4-8c51-25741dc982ff	2	wasn't as awful as i thought it would be. might have been better with a different lead.
/m/then_came_you_2020	1bcfbd40-2eb3-31ec-a234-5574cd9e40bf	1.5	I had a bet with my mother how far into the movie it would be before Gifford shoved her singing talent down our throat. She won with 9 minutes. Craig Ferguson saves this movie and I can’t imagine his chiropractic bill after carrying Gifford through that mess of a screenplay she wrote. Watch at your own risk.
/m/then_came_you_2020	1bcfbd40-2eb3-31ec-a234-5574cd9e40bf	1	Beautiful scenery. Terrible story. Terrible acting.
/m/then_came_you_2020	1bcfbd40-2eb3-31ec-a234-5574cd9e40bf	5	Our group of 5 elderly ladies thoroughly enjoyed it. OK, story was a predictable but so what?  Gave us lots of giggles and loved the Scottish scenery.
/m/then_came_you_2020	1bcfbd40-2eb3-31ec-a234-5574cd9e40bf	0.5	Sorry, I never write bad reviews but this movie absolutely screams for it. Easily the worst movie I've ever watched! Atrocious acting from all but ‘the best friend', who was at least believable. KLG should stick to her day job, she is not destined for greatness as an actor or screenplay writer. The ‘plot' was as wooden as the acting. Forced comedy and over the top reactions were completely unbearable. Save your money and steer clear of this stinker! ☹️
/m/then_came_you_2020	1bcfbd40-2eb3-31ec-a234-5574cd9e40bf	0.5	This movie is terrible. Worst acting ever, no chemistry, forced, contrived and self indulgent by Kathie Lee Gifford. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Went with a group of girlfriends who are keen to support our local cinema during COVID times but we all hated it. We are generally easy pleased but this movie is dreadful.
/m/then_came_you_2020	1bcfbd40-2eb3-31ec-a234-5574cd9e40bf	1.5	An American widow takes her husbands ashes to Scotland and stays in a castle/inn with a crusty but handsome laird as host. Over the top performance from Kathie Lee Gifford, who seems to have written the screenplay as a vanity project to show off her legs. Elizabeth Hurley is wooden and her direction is not the best, with confusing pacing. There is no chemistry with the leading lady and Craig Ferguson , who is actually quite good. Ford Kiernan as the comical best friend gives us the funniest moments. The local village seems to be populated by Americans, and Phyllida Law as the Scottish elderly aunt has an English accent. Beautiful scenery, though!
/m/then_came_you_2020	1bcfbd40-2eb3-31ec-a234-5574cd9e40bf	4.5	Very surprising from what should have been a formulaic romance. I blame the ease of acting - every actor in this is amazing, as if they are just having a good old time. Nice way to spend a rainy afternoon.
/m/then_came_you_2020	1bcfbd40-2eb3-31ec-a234-5574cd9e40bf	1.5	Really nothing interesting or reminiscent of actual life.
/m/then_came_you_2020	1bcfbd40-2eb3-31ec-a234-5574cd9e40bf	1	Craig Ferguson is great, but Kathy Lee Gifford and the plot are horrendous.
/m/then_came_you_2020	1bcfbd40-2eb3-31ec-a234-5574cd9e40bf	0.5	Just awful! Don't waste your time with this one. Cathy Lee never knows when to give up.
/m/2067	6f9ec843-4233-3346-9434-cbd21279d65c	1.5	Even though the shots are sometimes impressive, the plot is awful and predictable, not to mention that our hero is so feminine, and keeps ranting and crying, terrible. The characters are a joke, like the so-called CEO and even the scientist outfits. It was just a waste of money
/m/2067	6f9ec843-4233-3346-9434-cbd21279d65c	4	The world building contrasted with its budget is first class and the premise is played out in an intelligent and tense manner. It's a tad too sentimental at times,(particularly the flashback sequences), but 2067 is a shockingly good time travel adventure.
/m/2067	6f9ec843-4233-3346-9434-cbd21279d65c	3	It is well produced, but elements of the story could have been portrayed better.
/m/2067	6f9ec843-4233-3346-9434-cbd21279d65c	2.5	This is not a well made movie by any sense of the word but the ideas, themes and feelings  the movie leaves you with are all good reasons to watch this film, unfortunately there are three main issues that prevent this movie from being good. The first issue is the awkward inclusion of many story points that makes the plot feel rushed and lazy. The second issue has to do with the time travel aspect of the movie. Out of The industry's plethora of time travel movies, this one tries the least in explaining how time travel works. The rules are never clear and the means are brushed past extremely quickly. My third and final gripe with this movie is the main lead Kodi Smit-McPhee who plays a stubborn, brainless idiot who seems to be having a mental breakdown throughout the entire movie. The character is incredibly annoying in his screechy tone of voice and his poor poor decisions that even horror movie characters wouldn't make. In conclusion, the movie does resonate with me through it political message and the decent cinematography but the messy plot and main lead leave much to be desired.
/m/2067	6f9ec843-4233-3346-9434-cbd21279d65c	2	Disappointing, mainly due to the cardboard acting and obviously tight budget. Could have been so much better.
/m/2067	6f9ec843-4233-3346-9434-cbd21279d65c	1.5	Criminally boring. Unintentionally hilarious
/m/2067	6f9ec843-4233-3346-9434-cbd21279d65c	0.5	Sorry, its unwatchable. I even went back to try and continue the movie after reading some of the positive reveiws here. Nope, no way. It is an absolutely horrible screenplay. Though, the effects were decent and the acting was tolerable.
/m/2067	6f9ec843-4233-3346-9434-cbd21279d65c	3	Although some details don't make sense and I didn't really like Smit-MacPhee's acting, 2067 has a good story with a lot of interesting twists. (6.5/10)
/m/2067	6f9ec843-4233-3346-9434-cbd21279d65c	0.5	As an Australian I found this to be an unwatchable embarrassment. The acting couldn't have been any worse, I literally cannot imagine how anybody thought this movie was worth making during ever stage of production. I think the average 6 year old wouldn't be able to ignore the sloppy dialogue and tacky story line. The world would have been better off if they just burned every dollar that was spent making this movie instead of producing this garbage.
/m/2067	6f9ec843-4233-3346-9434-cbd21279d65c	1	worst acting i have ever seen! otherwise a great movie with nice pictures and cool soundtrack
/m/the_devil_to_pay_2020	4a7db93e-0604-34d5-8f05-c733d275a0bd	5	Great movie. This may have been someone's real life story.
/m/the_devil_to_pay_2020	4a7db93e-0604-34d5-8f05-c733d275a0bd	5	The performance by the lead actress is so moving. How is this woman not a huge star? Some great character faces, too. Beautiful photography of the mountains. Gripping. If you are a fan of southern gothic this film is unmissable.
/m/the_devil_to_pay_2020	4a7db93e-0604-34d5-8f05-c733d275a0bd	5	Amazing actress! You could feel her pain amd determination.  She did not hesitate!! Seriously a life lesson. Do not hesitate! Glad it was not about race per say. They just happened to be black.and white. Great movie
/m/the_devil_to_pay_2020	4a7db93e-0604-34d5-8f05-c733d275a0bd	5	Best Appalachian noir I've seen in a while.
/m/the_devil_to_pay_2020	4a7db93e-0604-34d5-8f05-c733d275a0bd	2	Another movie that's really well acted and shot, but has twenty minutes of thin story stretched to feature length. In that time, there are a lot of shots of gorgeous Appalachian scenery, and lots of shots not as interesting. Now, if you have all these shots that move very slowly, and you'd rather watch shots of mountain scenery than other shots where things don't much happen, and you have a very thin story, and even though the acting and cinematography are first rate, what kind of movie do you have? Kind of a travelogue with a few folks acting out a kind of story among the scenery. It had almost no emotional effect on me at all. Pedestrian, boring.
/m/the_devil_to_pay_2020	4a7db93e-0604-34d5-8f05-c733d275a0bd	5	Beautiful written and performed.  Do not mess with this woman!
/m/the_devil_to_pay_2020	4a7db93e-0604-34d5-8f05-c733d275a0bd	5	This is a very good movie. Miss Deadwyler is a standout actor. She competes with KALI as the goddess of motherhood and death.  The script is well written. The Skye team did a great job making this film. It is visually excellent with beautiful views of the north Georgia mountains.
/m/the_devil_to_pay_2020	4a7db93e-0604-34d5-8f05-c733d275a0bd	5	This gripping story about survival and revenge has stunning visuals and is remarkably character-driven from it's lead to characters you only see in one scene. It is a unique look at family feud's deep in the Appalachian mountains, were they police themselves. A must watch 10/10
/m/the_devil_to_pay_2020	4a7db93e-0604-34d5-8f05-c733d275a0bd	5	Great thriller about an Appalachian women doing what she must to survive. Excellent performances from all, but especially from the lead, Danielle Deadwyler. Catherine Dyer gave me chills as the matriarchal villain. Beautiful scenic shots highlighting the Appalachian region as well. The music was hauntingly beautiful and really complimented the characters and the story. I highly recommend watching this movie.
/m/the_devil_to_pay_2020	4a7db93e-0604-34d5-8f05-c733d275a0bd	5	Amazing performance by Danielle Deadwyler....great story, great setting, and great music.
/m/the_phenomenon	b27a672c-2481-38dc-8649-f1c69867a611	5	Great addition to UFO community aducation :) First time (not belivers) introduction!  HAVE TO WATCH IT!
/m/the_phenomenon	b27a672c-2481-38dc-8649-f1c69867a611	5	One of the most compelling movies ever made on the subject. Absolutely undeniable.
/m/the_phenomenon	b27a672c-2481-38dc-8649-f1c69867a611	4.5	Really loved this documentary! A lot of really great information I have not seen out.
/m/the_phenomenon	b27a672c-2481-38dc-8649-f1c69867a611	5	Incredible. The best UFO documentary available.
/m/the_phenomenon	b27a672c-2481-38dc-8649-f1c69867a611	4	Fun to watch. It presents somewhat believable testimonies about UFO's. The fact that Peter Coyote (known from numerous Ken Burns documentaries) lent his voice as narrator gives it a more credible feel. However the evidence is ultimately not really compelling and the film starts to smell of the typical quackery you often get with this subject near the end (e.g. humanoid-shaped aliens using telepathic communication to tell people to recycle and that technology is bad).    Some things within the film seem really dubious, for example the scene where the French scientist and some PhD guy from Stanford are testing metal fragments supposedly from an alien ship. They suggest that the metals are completely unnatural and couldn't be from Earth. Okay, well if this is true then the entire scientific community should be all over this, and this should be revolutionizing physics and materials science in every major university. But...nothing like this is happening. So this seems bogus.   The skeptic's argument has weight: Billions of people on Earth have smartphones with high quality cameras on them nearly 24/7. If this stuff is legit, shouldn't we have better evidence than a handful of potato-quality images and videos? Nonetheless, it's still an interesting topic, especially when you hear testimony from apparently sane and credentialed people from the air force and what not.
/m/the_phenomenon	b27a672c-2481-38dc-8649-f1c69867a611	4	Este documental presenta investigaciones, opiniones y testimonios creíbles -de pilotos de guerra y oficiales de alto rango de USA, astronautas de la NASA y de científicos reconocidos de universidades como Stanford- sobre casos de UFOs bien documentados, dejando fuera el típico sensacionalismo que predomina en este subgénero.  Posiblemente el mejor documental de UFOs que he visto.
/m/the_phenomenon	b27a672c-2481-38dc-8649-f1c69867a611	3.5	Well done.  I appreciate the effort and the support for our democratic principles, and belief that a healthy society is an informed one.
/m/the_phenomenon	b27a672c-2481-38dc-8649-f1c69867a611	4.5	Most convincing film I've seen on the topic. 4.7/5
/m/the_phenomenon	b27a672c-2481-38dc-8649-f1c69867a611	5	This documentary is a must watch!!! It's the start of the conversation we need to have as we become enlightened to a well documented, recorded, gathered, back-engineered, and cataloged phenomenon all around the world. This affects us all! US Intel will be delivering further evidence of what they know. We must talk about this NOW! Thank you James Fox for doing this and the hard work you all put in is well evident. First rented it on Amazon, then bought it only to later find out there are 3 hours extra via iTunes. The interview with Astronuaght Story Musgrave was powerful. Not as powerful as the African School, but still powerful! Thank you!
/m/the_phenomenon	b27a672c-2481-38dc-8649-f1c69867a611	4.5	I found it very interesting, because you can watch peoples talk about their encounter with Ufos.You can read between lines, have your own view and analyse of what they say.It is well produced and entertaining until the end.I have to admit, I found unfortunate that we don't hear the the Harvard Psychiatrist who interviews the kids.(would be fun to hear him out)But it  really worked for me & I definitely recommend it.(for over 10 years old audience)
/m/the_wolf_of_snow_hollow	51a9a242-5fa7-38eb-bc6f-7949877af677	2.5	OK, but not great mystery about a string of killings in a small ski town in Utah where just one of the question is whether the killer is a man, a wolf or a werewolf. Layered on top of this is the various problems of the sheriff, John Marshall (Cummings), the rest of the department and small town life in general. Tries to do too much and as a result doesn't quite pull any of it off.
/m/the_wolf_of_snow_hollow	51a9a242-5fa7-38eb-bc6f-7949877af677	4	A personal triumph of the starring actor-director Jim Cummings, it features great acting, great storytelling and script, mixture of different genres (horror, comedy, social, crime and mystery etc.) and great finale. Very fresh directorial point of view. Certified fresh!
/m/the_wolf_of_snow_hollow	51a9a242-5fa7-38eb-bc6f-7949877af677	3.5	Riki Lindhome, as a buddy cop, is equaled on screen by partner Jim Cummings (also the writer and director) in this not-what-you-think not-quite-a-genre oddity. Perfect for a hot summer afternoon/evening viewing, the bluish-white snow covering everyone and everything adds an additional, shimmering layer of intrigue. What exactly is lying under the surface of Cummings' character? The Horror - 3 stars: A werewolf plus a messed up cop. Hook/ Pace - 4 stars, solid, you can't pause this one.   Jumps - 3 stars: Good ones! The Film: 4 stars. Gorgeous, funny, an oddity, and its smart. Cummings and Lindhome Rock!  The End: 4 stars, multiple resolutions. Summary: 3.6 stars.
/m/the_wolf_of_snow_hollow	51a9a242-5fa7-38eb-bc6f-7949877af677	2.5	Very few films have successfully merged elements of comedy and horror. Snow Hollow attempts to land this stunt with it's who-du n-it plot and deftly comedic lead performance. The results are quite underwhelming.
/m/the_wolf_of_snow_hollow	51a9a242-5fa7-38eb-bc6f-7949877af677	4	Unexpectedly enjoyable.
/m/the_wolf_of_snow_hollow	51a9a242-5fa7-38eb-bc6f-7949877af677	3.5	Really good movie that was ruined by a disappointing ending.
/m/the_wolf_of_snow_hollow	51a9a242-5fa7-38eb-bc6f-7949877af677	4	True to life portraits and no nonsense theme make you wonder when to see another like this.
/m/the_wolf_of_snow_hollow	51a9a242-5fa7-38eb-bc6f-7949877af677	5	Great fun movie with clean directing and great acting.  It was fun, funny, and emotional.  Great picture!
/m/the_wolf_of_snow_hollow	51a9a242-5fa7-38eb-bc6f-7949877af677	3.5	Black comedy slasher movie that is cleverly written.
/m/the_wolf_of_snow_hollow	51a9a242-5fa7-38eb-bc6f-7949877af677	2.5	It wasn't great. Honestly, I feel the that the main character of the movie overall hurt my enjoyment of the movie. He was just straight-up downright annoying to the point where he made me not want to keep going- certainly not root for him. Also I had just watched Werewolves Within before this, another werewolf movie, and it blew this one out of the water. Which might have made me enjoy this one even less because the bar was raised.   Was not good & would not recommend.

/m/lets_scare_julie	2c8a566c-1518-3ed5-94b9-48bd17ae1b78	2.5	An promising premise and carefully effective cinematography offer a lot of potential to this teen thriller. However, it is bogged down by an overly long setup and a messy plot, with certain aspects borderlining the abstract. You can watch this for the excitement of what could have been, but don't expect too much from what it is.
/m/lets_scare_julie	2c8a566c-1518-3ed5-94b9-48bd17ae1b78	1	Chaotic in a bad way. The first chunk of the movie is just all the characters talking over each other, and then the ending is ???
/m/lets_scare_julie	2c8a566c-1518-3ed5-94b9-48bd17ae1b78	2.5	the cinematography was great and the concept was interesting at first. unfortunately, it seemed that in the second act there was no direction on what to do with the film as well as leaving a lot of unanswered questions. wasted potential.
/m/lets_scare_julie	2c8a566c-1518-3ed5-94b9-48bd17ae1b78	4	Excellent example of the slow burn, jam packed with so many little things. From the early tension surrounding the leads forced interactions with her new "friends" building to a solid scary conclusion, I was on the edge of my seat biting my nails throughout the whole thing, jumped twice, and gave a real shit about the lead. The best horror I've seen this year so far.
/m/lets_scare_julie	2c8a566c-1518-3ed5-94b9-48bd17ae1b78	3.5	The single shot gimmick is handled pretty well here, and lends itself well to the dreamlike tension that flows throughout that latter half of the movie. It may be pretty cold for a lot of viewers, thanks to all ambiguous ending and some really obnoxious characters. But think it delivers a decent amount of dread.
/m/lets_scare_julie	2c8a566c-1518-3ed5-94b9-48bd17ae1b78	3	I kept changing my mind on this one. The acting's very good, and there are times when the film seems poised to be really great, but it never quite gets there. The scene-setting perhaps took up too much of the runtime.
/m/lets_scare_julie	2c8a566c-1518-3ed5-94b9-48bd17ae1b78	2	Now I understand the short run time. If this movie had been 2 hours with that ending I'd be pretty upset.
/m/lets_scare_julie	2c8a566c-1518-3ed5-94b9-48bd17ae1b78	5	Remarkable one take horror - kept me glued
/m/lets_scare_julie	2c8a566c-1518-3ed5-94b9-48bd17ae1b78	4	Fun and fresh concept! Highly recommend!
/m/herb_alpert_is	c880a5f1-24bd-4594-a7f6-6c5e970c58f5	4.5	This movie reveals the history of a man who has trumpeted kindness, generosity, respect for persons, empowerment of talent and a legacy of great, great...well, trumpeting! (As well as other forms of music.) He was a personal brand-builder before the term was invented, and from Sting to Quincy Jones to Questlove to astronauts it was nice to hear others' testimonies of him. As a fan of positivity I loved it, though I think even skeptics would have to accede to Herb Alpert's wonderful story.
/m/herb_alpert_is	c880a5f1-24bd-4594-a7f6-6c5e970c58f5	4.5	Such a delight to spend this time with a great artist and the joyful music he created through the years.  And, to see his impact on the music world with all of the up and coming artists he supported is just incredible. Finally, what a bright and positive inspiration he is through his deep philanthropic commitments. The film brought much needed positivity to my head and heart, especially during these troubling times.
/m/into_the_labyrinth	781cf1f2-7afe-371a-b830-e1a73c57940a	4	Not your typical movie. Pay attention. I found this to be an enjoyable journey. I think the reviews are skewed by people who didn't understand the movie. After you get to the end you want to watch it again to see what you missed the first time through. Definitely worth the subtitles in my opinion.
/m/into_the_labyrinth	781cf1f2-7afe-371a-b830-e1a73c57940a	0.5	I watched it because Dustin Hoffman is in it. Total waste of time. How this movie ever got released is beyond me.
/m/into_the_labyrinth	781cf1f2-7afe-371a-b830-e1a73c57940a	3	I figured most of the end within the first 10 minutes.  The very end, didn't make much sense. It's mostly subtitled, so if that's not your thing pass on it.
/m/into_the_labyrinth	781cf1f2-7afe-371a-b830-e1a73c57940a	3.5	A lot of people hated this movie. I liked it, although it made me work hard. It's definitely not passive viewing.  You have to be in a puzzle-solving mood to appreciate it. Even after the final reveal in the last 30 seconds, I'm not sure I entirely solved it.  It's highly stylized, maybe overly so, but beautiful to look at. Dustin Hoffman doesn't get as much screen time as you would expect, since his picture is in all the promo ads. The real star is Toni Servillo, who turns in a wonderful performance.  More than half the movie is spoken in Italian with English subtitles. They're very well done and easy to read. Subtitles don't bother me, but I wonder, as other critics have, why it was even necessary for most of the film to be in Italian.  In his very last scene, Servillo speaks English. Am I missing something? Is the language part of the puzzle? If so, please explain. I have to admit, I'm slow with puzzles.  I thought this was an excellent, memorable film, in spite of its labyrinthine plot (sorry, couldn't resist). But if you prefer straightforward storytelling, you probably won't agree.
/m/into_the_labyrinth	781cf1f2-7afe-371a-b830-e1a73c57940a	0.5	I paid $ 3.99 on the strength of Dustin Hoffman's  participation in this movie. Had to stop watching at the scene where kidnapped woman has to drink out of a dirty toilet. Blech! If I had read the reviews beforehand I would not have thrown away my money. Bad, icky and my guess is that Dustin ends up being the kidnapper, after watching the first 10 minutes. Do not waste your $$ on this.
/m/into_the_labyrinth	781cf1f2-7afe-371a-b830-e1a73c57940a	2.5	Un po' troppo pretenzioso, mischiare una trama cosi complessa e dettagliata (comunque ottima ovviamente) con una regia altrettanto elaborata ha reso il film non così godibile come poteva essere. Non si riesce a prendere ritmo e non ci si affeziona a nessun personaggio. Forse, essendo una storia molto complessa, la si poteva raccontare più linearmente. Avrei evitato anche alcuni passaggi in stile fumetto "hroma key" , chiaro richiamo al fumetto presente nel film, forse erano evitabili per alleggerire un minimo.
/m/into_the_labyrinth	781cf1f2-7afe-371a-b830-e1a73c57940a	0.5	Seeing Dustin Hoffman was in this movie was a huge misdirection.  The movie was somewhere between a spaghetti western and a horror movie with comic book touches.  The premise was interesting but the thematic scoring was over the top like when Clint Eastwood confronts the bad guys in Fistful of Dollars.  A giant Easter bunny head on a man with glowing pink eyes was meant to be scary but was laughable.
/m/into_the_labyrinth	781cf1f2-7afe-371a-b830-e1a73c57940a	1	I'm 33 minutes in and wondering how much they must've paid Dustin Hoffman to be involved.  I've stopped watching briefly to find out who directed it because it's appallingly bad.  I imagine the novel might be pretty good, it's clear there is a case here of a director more concerned with his "vision" of the film rather than just telling the story.  It's stylised, confusing, and rambling.  The first thirty seconds were absurd and a sign of things to come.  There's really no point in writing further about this film except to say that I really wish so many people (some of the actors are talented) hadn't wasted so much time and money pursuing the vision of a director with very poor taste and even poorer judgement.  Just tell the story - it's really that simple.
/m/into_the_labyrinth	781cf1f2-7afe-371a-b830-e1a73c57940a	5	It's interesting with a twist at the end. Searched the internet to find some common understanding of what happened and I guess nobody else talks about it. Was Dr Green real or was he the real kidnapper? Was the detective trapped in the labyrinth too? Can somebody pls tell 🤷‍♀️
/m/into_the_labyrinth	781cf1f2-7afe-371a-b830-e1a73c57940a	0.5	Unmitigated, nonsensical piece of shit with no pay off.
/m/sightless	99b535f4-b881-3c33-880b-1db7b40df418	3	The slowburn and thrill of this film with an unpredictable plotline and suspenseful scenery is great to leave you hooked into how this story unravels. You see the film from a perspective until its snatched to you keeping the surprise element and suspense to the brim until the entire runtime finishes even with its slow and weak sequences with illogical twists or ideas, it's a thrilling and intruiging film to watch.
/m/sightless	99b535f4-b881-3c33-880b-1db7b40df418	5	Had me guessing throughout, really didn't see that twist coming. Even though the main star is told not to trust anyone and I thought I might have sussed the plot, I was so wrong!
/m/sightless	99b535f4-b881-3c33-880b-1db7b40df418	3	This was fine until it got to the twist and then the twist was great. I am almost never surprised but this twist got me. Not a GOOD movie but entertaining enough to make it worth watching once.
/m/sightless	99b535f4-b881-3c33-880b-1db7b40df418	2	Some interesting ideas in the first half, and she’s gorgeous. But give me a break.
/m/sightless	99b535f4-b881-3c33-880b-1db7b40df418	3	Sightless is a twisty turny thriller with good ideas, even if taken from elsewhere. The compelling elements will keep you glued, which is more than a lot of thrillers. Petsch and Director Cooper Karl have big futures ahead. We see it.
/m/sightless	99b535f4-b881-3c33-880b-1db7b40df418	4.5	Absolutely amazing. From feeling safe to the mysteries to the drama and emotions, and all the thrill, especially the cinematography, entirely beautiful. Side note, obviously wouldn't put on top of a recommendation list, as there are many other options to choose from.
/m/sightless	99b535f4-b881-3c33-880b-1db7b40df418	4	I like it. The plot twist was great. It was a little bit difficult to understand the dialogue in some parts but if you put one and one together, it becomes interesting. Kept me on my toes too
/m/sightless	99b535f4-b881-3c33-880b-1db7b40df418	3	meh; it's an interesting enough story, but i'm not sure if it's the dialog or the acting or what -- but it just wasn't that good. i would not recommend this one.
/m/sightless	99b535f4-b881-3c33-880b-1db7b40df418	0.5	The most annoying movie I've ever watched.
/m/sightless	99b535f4-b881-3c33-880b-1db7b40df418	2	It was okay the twist at the end was shocking but other than that nothing to write home about
/m/lost_girls_and_love_hotels	3984d29a-05bf-413c-9b79-83c4f05465ff	1	Daddario is excellent but the film is weak, as a lot of indie films tend to be. Opting for style over substance and trying to be too clever that the beats miss is the least of its problems.
/m/lost_girls_and_love_hotels	3984d29a-05bf-413c-9b79-83c4f05465ff	5	This is one of those movies I had to remember the title of and make sure to put it on my top favorites list of 2021. You'll see low reviews but I thought it was exceptional. First of all, it's shot in Tokyo. Also, it's not just a love story, but also dives a little into her pain for pleasure/submissive desires. The romance is hot. The whole movie is captivating. This is one of Alexandria's edgiest roles yet other than True Detective. Go see it tonight.
/m/lost_girls_and_love_hotels	3984d29a-05bf-413c-9b79-83c4f05465ff	1.5	Alexandra Daddario's performance was the only good thing about this movie. The story and the setting are too depressing.
/m/lost_girls_and_love_hotels	3984d29a-05bf-413c-9b79-83c4f05465ff	3	Lost Girls and Love Hotels is a compelling look at a woman on the edge. Daddario does a stellar job here in one of her strongest performances to date. The seedier side of Japan is on show but it's worth a visit.
/m/lost_girls_and_love_hotels	3984d29a-05bf-413c-9b79-83c4f05465ff	2.5	A self-destructive and depressive girl spirals down a seedy underworld with her Yakuza (sorta) boyfriend. She wonders aimlessly around Tokyo, looking for direction but never finding it, and neither does this movie. It's moody, has some decent atmosphere, and Daddario is great as always, but it's a rather tame and plodding psychosexual drama.
/m/lost_girls_and_love_hotels	3984d29a-05bf-413c-9b79-83c4f05465ff	2.5	Lost girls and love hotels it’s almost like watching 50 shades lite The performances here are well done in the movie is a decent character drama but it is very slow moving. For a woman who is in love with a gangster don’t expect any shoot outs or action scenes. The movie tries to be like soft core porn and it’s never really sexy or exciting. It’s just an average film that is easily forgettable.
/m/lost_girls_and_love_hotels	3984d29a-05bf-413c-9b79-83c4f05465ff	0.5	The movie was so damn boring, i started distracting my self with reddit and than there was all that fan service. Most of this movie is tame soft core porn, a very boring softcore fan service. If you want to be bored it is a most watch.
/m/lost_girls_and_love_hotels	3984d29a-05bf-413c-9b79-83c4f05465ff	2.5	Margaret has lost her way and moved to Japan to run from a painful past and family.  She'll sleep with anything that shows interest, but falls for a local gangster.  Their on again off again painfully highlights what the lonely human condition looks like.
/m/lost_girls_and_love_hotels	3984d29a-05bf-413c-9b79-83c4f05465ff	1.5	Visually astonishing but feels empty on the inside. Devoided from things happening, it is even lacking the passion one might expect from that storyline. Flatlined.
/m/lost_girls_and_love_hotels	3984d29a-05bf-413c-9b79-83c4f05465ff	1.5	1.5 out of 5 stars. Lost Girls and Love Hotel is a drama film about Margaret (Alexandria Daddario) who works as an instructor assistant in Japan. Living day to day hanging and drinking with her friends. And than asking random guys to take her to a love hotel. Until she meets Kazu (Takehiro Hira). She slowly becomes obsessed with him. While he has a personal life that he cant walk away from. The plot is boring. It focuses on Margaret. And how psychologically she is having a problem. Where she lives life as a risk with picking up a random guy for sexual satisfaction. Even if it was a strange random guy. Her obsession takes a hold of her. Where she cant make it to work in time. She always appears to be drunk. The direction is dull and the script is very bleak. The performances are tedious. Alexandria Daddario is a talented actress but wasted with a tedious drama film.
/m/blackbird_2020	6d24193c-253a-35b2-b270-fc52c301c945	3.5	ALS is taking Susan's life - and her family gathers to say goodbye to her as she prepares to euthanize herself.  Its wildly uncomfortable, but Winslet and the other family members kill the acting.
/m/blackbird_2020	6d24193c-253a-35b2-b270-fc52c301c945	2.5	A film that leaves the viewer with a lot of inner and disturbing questions about life and its end. A group of exceptional actors adds personality to this unusual subject, with truly affectionate small gestures that they exchange between themselves. However, after a promising start the movie takes an "already seen" turn and wastes its promises.
/m/blackbird_2020	6d24193c-253a-35b2-b270-fc52c301c945	3.5	It's a good movie, exploring a family's responses to its Matriarch's wishes to be in control of her death before her degenerative illness progresses any further. It doesn't delve into the ethics of assisted dying, nor does it involve itself with the argument surrounding it. Instead, it tells a story of one woman's wish, and the impact that has. The acting is good, though the ending feels overly sentimental and not as emotionally tuned in as the rest of the film
/m/blackbird_2020	6d24193c-253a-35b2-b270-fc52c301c945	4	Everyone should have the right to end his/her life and the means to do so should be legal.. Good movie
/m/blackbird_2020	6d24193c-253a-35b2-b270-fc52c301c945	3.5	I thought it was beautiful and sad. The acting was excellent.
/m/blackbird_2020	6d24193c-253a-35b2-b270-fc52c301c945	4	Susan Sarandon suele ser garantía y está no es la excepción. Este filme retrata una reunión familiar trascendente, inusual y que confronta, donde se escribe una historia que conmueve y hace reflexionar al espectador sobre el sentido mismo de la vida, sí, profunda, así es esta película.
/m/blackbird_2020	6d24193c-253a-35b2-b270-fc52c301c945	4.5	I thought this film was absolutely beautiful, from its slightly desaturated location and stunning architecture, to its many deeply touching, poignant and joyful revelations. Unlike many critics, I found this film filled with relatable characters, and incredibly moving moments. I accept that there were a few contrivances, but they were far outweighed by beautiful, sad and hilarious character-driven moments. All of the actors were fantastic, but Susan Sarandon shone.
/m/blackbird_2020	6d24193c-253a-35b2-b270-fc52c301c945	3.5	I don't think this is a great movie but it's certainly a good one and, as it draws to a close, it makes some moves that will be very controversial for some. Sarandon holds the whole thing together both as an actor and as the matriarch of the family, all of whom have their baggage to deal with. Maria Wasikowska is excellent as Anna who seems to be the only one in the family who is distressed at the idea that her mother is going to suicide to avoid her deteriorating medical condition. There's the occasional humour but most of the story is pretty depressing and often very moving. The soundtrack is beautiful and sensitive and never overwhelms what is happening on the screen. Definitely worth a look with lots to discuss when the credits roll!
/m/blackbird_2020	6d24193c-253a-35b2-b270-fc52c301c945	4.5	This is a wonderful movie about a heartbreaking subject that is filled with rich characters and splendid acting.  The beautiful house is its own character.  The cinematography and lighting all add to the mood of the story.  My own family is filled with love, awkwardness, annoyances and joy so the family dynamics resonated with me.  For people who love family dramas, this won't disappoint.
/m/blackbird_2020	6d24193c-253a-35b2-b270-fc52c301c945	3	A family gathers for one final weekend before the matriarch (Susan Sarandon) ends her life due to a rapidly-approaching fatal illness. The early mildly-affectionate and quietly-detached mood escalates in the final few minutes toward the ultimate dissenting encounters. Even though the limited locations and dramatic interactions feel like a play, this is actually a remake of a Danish film Silent Heart. It features an impressive cast, including Kate Winslet and Mia Wasikowska as the daughters and San Neill as the husband. They all proceed with appropriate concern and apprehension. Their performances aren't flawed, just not especially moving.  This might be because of the neutral writing or detached direction. Either way, it's an interesting drama that lacks any emotional heft. Interesting side note: The beachside house that's supposed to be The Hamptons is actually located next to Winslet's own home on the South Coast of England.
/m/h_is_for_happiness	aad84e55-6693-4722-9e8d-fc4f9819710c	4	A lovely feel good movie. Douglas Benson from another dimension haha.....absolutely brilliant. Defo a must watch
/m/h_is_for_happiness	aad84e55-6693-4722-9e8d-fc4f9819710c	3.5	I loved it!-really entertaining and well acted
/m/house_of_cardin	0665884d-6d22-47ea-9121-0df7dc41b20c	5	Total eye candy - the visuals are off the charts amazing. The story of Cardin's success is fascinating and it is well told.  I already want to see it again!
/m/house_of_cardin	0665884d-6d22-47ea-9121-0df7dc41b20c	4	This rare look into the life and career of visionary designer Pierre Cardin provides an insightful review of how one man almost single-handedly changed the fashion industry and the marketing of name-based brands involving an array of product releases. In interviews with Cardin himself, as well as associates, fellow designers, and models and celebrities who wore his creations, viewers see how influential he was in such areas as "democratizing" the world of couture, bringing cross-cultural influences to clothing design, making fashion acceptable for male audiences and introducing modernism to a field that had previously been entrenched in conventionalism. While the film has an occasional tendency toward worshiping its subject, its treatment is generally reverent, respectful of his accomplishments and careful to avoid delving too deeply into private matters that are truly no one's business. A delightful documentary for those who appreciate good design, no matter what form it comes in.
/m/luz_the_flower_of_evil	7cb1e13b-2638-47bd-bd7e-550de750c884	4.5	The Witch meets Midsommar, meets The Tree of Life meets Jodorowsky. Pretty much a win
/m/luz_the_flower_of_evil	7cb1e13b-2638-47bd-bd7e-550de750c884	5	I might have to rewatch it again, but it is so filled with metaphors and symbols. Very unique, specially in the horror and genre scene. A breathe of fresh air. This will became a cult film for sure.
/m/luz_the_flower_of_evil	7cb1e13b-2638-47bd-bd7e-550de750c884	4	I cannot even begin to describe it. It is not a film, it is an experience. Don't go into this film expecting a commercially driven jump scare horror film but an spiritual and dark parable
/m/luz_the_flower_of_evil	7cb1e13b-2638-47bd-bd7e-550de750c884	4	love in the name of religion is never true
/m/luz_the_flower_of_evil	7cb1e13b-2638-47bd-bd7e-550de750c884	3.5	A cult film like no other. The beauty of the shots is mesmerizing and the whole sense of tranquility is incredibly dense in some sort of poetic way
/m/luz_the_flower_of_evil	7cb1e13b-2638-47bd-bd7e-550de750c884	4	More than a film, it was a completely different experience with a clear message of how by things cannot be found outside of us but within
/m/luz_the_flower_of_evil	7cb1e13b-2638-47bd-bd7e-550de750c884	5	Looks like a winner to me
/m/luz_the_flower_of_evil	7cb1e13b-2638-47bd-bd7e-550de750c884	4	Pretty cool movie, now streaming in SHUDDER, kind of unique, ambiguous and gorgeous looking
/m/luz_the_flower_of_evil	7cb1e13b-2638-47bd-bd7e-550de750c884	5	I wasn't able to decipher the film and didn't knew what was coming next and that is something that pays off, it is beautiful and brutal at the same time. Not for all tastes but for those who are into the occult, art and philosophy is a film that is a must watch.
/m/luz_the_flower_of_evil	7cb1e13b-2638-47bd-bd7e-550de750c884	5	Luz: The Flower of Evil is an instant hidden gem and a future cult classic. A film that will age like only a few will.
/m/the_swerve	0695ec34-7ef1-3fc9-a80c-855eebc48230	2	Extremely well acted and produced, but it's nothing but pain, fear, and death. That's all. There's nothing redeeming; it's 100% darkness. I cannot bring myself to give a positive review of something like this, ever.
/m/the_swerve	0695ec34-7ef1-3fc9-a80c-855eebc48230	2	The Swerve is a thoroughly unpleasant movie. It's well directed and acted, with a strong performance by Azura Skye. It's not entertaining. Rather, it's depressing and disturbing.  That doesn't mean it's bad. If your criteria for a film is hyper-realism, it succeeds greatly. But if you're in the mood for mindless, light entertainment, forget this one. The Swerve is solidly in the Diary of a Mad Housewife tradition. The theme of a woman losing her mind has been explored by John Cassavetes and Woody Allen. In fact, Skye's Holly somewhat reminded me of Gena Rowlands in Allen's 1980's Another Woman.  Holly is a suburban high school English teacher with two surly, spoiled teenage sons and an unsympathetic husband who manages a grocery store. She almost anorexically thin, neurotically hung up on killing a mouse in her home, and upset about a childhood experience that her weird sister keeps bringing up. She gobbles anti-depressants. To add to the misery, her husband has been fooling around with one of his employees. One of her male students is attracted to her, and she has a shocking, inappropriate moment in her minivan with him. Not a good idea. It just fuels his obsession with her, and she doesn't try to stop it. Watching her descend into madness is not a lot of fun. Some critics consider The Swerve to be about mental illness rather than female depression stemming from external forces. I think it's a bit of both. I wonder if women will respond to The Swerve differently than men. Probably. As a clueless male with a limited understanding of women's emotions and the way that those emotions overwhelm their lives, I felt squirmy and edgy throughout this film. I recognized Skye's talent and appreciated her committed performance, but overall, I was terribly uncomfortable.  Of course, art doesn't have to be edifying and uplifting in order to be valid. It can be bleak, humorless, hopeless, and despairing. But as for me, if I'm feeling dark, I'd prefer to look at Munch's "The Scream" than to sit through 90 minutes of unabated misery.  The final act of this film turned my stomach. It also made me lose my appetite for apple pie.
/m/the_swerve	0695ec34-7ef1-3fc9-a80c-855eebc48230	4	The spiraling disintegration of a mother begotten. Expectations were subverted.
/m/the_swerve	0695ec34-7ef1-3fc9-a80c-855eebc48230	5	Hard to watch, hard to stop watching. Holly disintegrates before our eyes, yet what makes this movie so powerful is how mundane her life is. A life, as the saying goes, of quiet desperation. That's the horror of depression. It need not look violent. It need not look justifiable from an outsider's point of view. But it exists and if left alone can multiply and destroy. At the end I just felt profoundly sad. And, full of admiration for such a masterful portrayal.
/m/the_swerve	0695ec34-7ef1-3fc9-a80c-855eebc48230	3	A beautifully scored, acted, shot, and edited predictable and unsatisfying story. Characters are flat and underdeveloped. Plot holes abound.
/m/the_swerve	0695ec34-7ef1-3fc9-a80c-855eebc48230	5	Must watch movie if you like slow burn psychological thinkers 9/10
/m/the_swerve	0695ec34-7ef1-3fc9-a80c-855eebc48230	4	‘The Swerve' Tells an All-Too-Real Story About One Person's Descent Into Madness
/m/the_swerve	0695ec34-7ef1-3fc9-a80c-855eebc48230	5	This movie is very well written, top-notch acting, brutal emotionally and hard to watch, but you just can't take your eyes off the screen.
/m/the_swerve	0695ec34-7ef1-3fc9-a80c-855eebc48230	2.5	There are two swerves in 'The Swerve', but you'd have to be not watching to see the second one coming.  There's a lot of good here for a film mostly spinning its wheels.  Dean Kapsalis shows he's got an idea for his feature debut.  He's got a pair of shorts to his credit and this would have been better served sliced down.  Azura Skye is marvelous.  She's worth the watch.  Somebody give her something juicy.  While her character is mostly one note she's tremendous.  Why do people run AT a gun?   Why is there nobody at the supermarket like ever.  I get it extras cost money, but holy moly I want to shop there.  This needs to be a lot tighter and crisp.  We have a some fantastic acting here, but again it tells the same story a couple times before we get to the obvious conclusion.  Final Score: 5/10
/m/the_swerve	0695ec34-7ef1-3fc9-a80c-855eebc48230	3.5	É bom, mas tem de tomar cuidado, com os gatilhos de sofrimento.
/m/alive_2019	34745ab5-b7ef-3fbe-800b-46a219f7b065	2	First off, I have to deduct stars for a number or reasons: 1. Reminded me with all the blood and guts of the movie "The Evil Dead" the one without Bruce Campbell where it was literally raining blood!  2. The movie became unrealistic at the end, there is no way to bring back life to the dead.  3. The joke at the end of the movie was not frightening at all but rather stupid.  Sorry but I can only give this movie a *2* star review!!
/m/alive_2019	34745ab5-b7ef-3fbe-800b-46a219f7b065	3.5	It was intriguing and unexpectedly good. Wasn't all that original but there were some twists that I enjoyed. It wasn't necessarily thrilling but it was entertaining and mysterious.
/m/alive_2019	34745ab5-b7ef-3fbe-800b-46a219f7b065	4	A brilliantly unnerving horror that keeps getting better to the last minute. Alive is an original and unique film that hinges on the outstanding performances of its three lead actors. They very convincingly portray the emotions that the audience reacts to. Every scene is more tense than the last and you're left thinking about the ending long after the credits roll.
/m/alive_2019	34745ab5-b7ef-3fbe-800b-46a219f7b065	5	This movie was actually awesome to be a low budget film it had me guessing and anticipating all the way through no it was not the best ever but it was damn interesting and kept me entertained the whole time and the the ending was a masterpiece one with a twist of many but an ending all in its own catergory would def recommend to watch I give this a thumbs up probably won't be bc of low budget filming but a sequel would have been cool I'd pay to see it for sure 👍🏻
/m/alive_2019	34745ab5-b7ef-3fbe-800b-46a219f7b065	3.5	Angus's performance was REALLY great along with pretty good effects and sets.
/m/alive_2019	34745ab5-b7ef-3fbe-800b-46a219f7b065	4.5	This was cruising along at a 2.5 star clip, gleefully gruesome torture porn with a mad scientist doctor weirdo, pretty fun but what's the point, then they hit you with an excellent twist at the end that's freaking brilliant, completely unexpected, that explains the doctor's weird behavior. Nightmarish and gut-bustingly outrageous at the same time. Nothing but terror and blood and then a huge sense of humor. I can picture the writers laughing and high fiving when they came up with the ending. Aah, does me good. I'm still laughing an hour later. Highly recommended.
/m/alive_2019	34745ab5-b7ef-3fbe-800b-46a219f7b065	3	A little too much torture porn for my tastes so the whole act I of the film drags for me. Gets more interesting at the end with a not bad twist. They really could have added to act II and reduced act I by a lot. Otherwise, it's solid horror and all three principle actors are good. There's a little weird scene on the road at one point that makes no sense but other than that, it works.
/m/alive_2019	34745ab5-b7ef-3fbe-800b-46a219f7b065	4	A thrilling story from writers Chuck McCue and Jules Vincent, Alive was a pulse-racing entry into the Grimmfest Film Festival 2018 lineup. Combining a captivity plot with a psychological thriller atmosphere and elements of torture horror, director Rob Grant delivers a bold and intriguing genre movie.  Thomas Cocquerel and Camille Stopps play a man and woman who wake up bound to hospital beds in a seemingly abandoned sanitarium, with plenty of cuts and scrapes to boot. Their only company is a sadistic yet well-spoken caretaker (Angus Macfadyen) and his growling Doberman. Their bafflement turns to unease as they discover that not only do they have to endure the cruel ministrations of their illustrious host, whose charming bedside manner is at complete odds with his use of twisted remedies and violent temper, they must also cope with a black hole in their memory where their identities used to be. Without the strength or know-how to escape, or the ability to fully recall who they even are, this appears to be one helluva road to recovery.   With a show-stopping performance from Macfadyen, the success of Alive utterly hinges on his enigmatic portrayal of the nurse/fatherly figure whose polarity of emotions make him a captivating on screen presence. The numerous attempts he makes to "heal" his patients are completely engrossing, delivering his almost wistful dialogue with such panache that audiences will be utterly spellbound. Instead of the tedious mad-scientist approach, Macfayden's character is far more personal, even poetic at times, and his delicate movement between love and outrage is marvellously nuanced.    Cocquerel is excellent as the kidnapee with a penchant for disobedience, his tension with his captor is transfixing and the performer does well with the physical demands of the role.    Stopps is brilliant in the role of kidnapee with a penchant for survival. The conflict her character experiences during numerous points in the movie is well-delivered.   The themes and atmosphere of Alive are too familiar for any self-respecting horror viewer to find mind-blowing. This story has been done countless times in film and TV narratives, and given the plot's limited locations, a dozen or so "captivity" films come to mind when watching. That being said, Grant's delivery of this movie is immaculate and audiences will find few faults to pick up on. The chemistry he elicits between the performers is exceptional and the thrilling final third has a jaunty pace that will get fingernails firmly driven into chair arms.
/m/alive_2019	34745ab5-b7ef-3fbe-800b-46a219f7b065	3	Unexplained kinda weird start, but a little creepy. Ended up being a good thriller/mystery sort of thing. They didn't really finish the ending, but it had a good plot twist to it.
/m/alive_2019	34745ab5-b7ef-3fbe-800b-46a219f7b065	5	I was surprised by this one. The suspense was great, not too bloody( but bloddy enough).  I am usually good at figuring out what is happening but this had me wondering until the end. And what a great ending. You have to see this one!
/m/antebellum	d802f906-1f59-43ee-bea1-a1d74dbcc924	1	Cartoonish, buffoonish. Plus "antibellum" means "before the war," but the old time sequence takes place during the war. Did no one know what the title meant? Duh!
/m/antebellum	d802f906-1f59-43ee-bea1-a1d74dbcc924	0.5	Doesn't make any sense. Back to the future slavery version? Worst movie ever
/m/antebellum	d802f906-1f59-43ee-bea1-a1d74dbcc924	5	It's absolutely amazing, the reason why the ratings are so low is because of a certain type of audience doesn't prefer to see un sugar coated realistic racism and trauma which was slavery related. Deserves more than what the "audience" rated it.
/m/antebellum	d802f906-1f59-43ee-bea1-a1d74dbcc924	0.5	First hour: slaves are tortured during the American 1860s civil war. Last half hour: more torture (well, other than one sassy hot chick who is ready and easy). I'd be embarrassed to have my name associated with this one. Anyone know how to clean the inside of a DVD player?
/m/antebellum	d802f906-1f59-43ee-bea1-a1d74dbcc924	3	Film against racism that wants to send a beautiful message of revenge and integration. So far so good, but it sends this message in a very confusing way, the plot is a total confusion and is full of holes and inconsistencies. Then the film is not a horror as he declares, at most it is a dramatic film and that's it
/m/antebellum	d802f906-1f59-43ee-bea1-a1d74dbcc924	1	Just a modern race dividing POS. Some of the acting was good and I love horror. But this is his worst work to date . Horrible writing despicable movie. And they all just willingly jump in little human oven at end. Clever trickery 😆 dumb👎
/m/antebellum	d802f906-1f59-43ee-bea1-a1d74dbcc924	4	Antebellum réussit à livrer un message fort sur les discriminations, les vexations et bien sûr les fantasmes liés à la race. Il le fait de façon originale et convaincante, en utilisant l'Histoire et la fiction. Il ne faut ici pas s'attendre à un film uniquement basé sur le suspense et les fameux twists, il n'y a ici d'artifice que dans un but didactique, et l'erreur serait de limiter l'intérêt du film à quelque chose qui nous ait finalement révélée bien avant la fin. Je m'interroge également sur cette étrange classification dans la catégorie "horreur", ce que le film, à mon sens, n'est pas. Notons une belle photographie, au sein d'une mise en scène irréprochable et élégante, et des acteurs très convaincants.  En bref, un film beau, divertissant et intelligent.
/m/antebellum	d802f906-1f59-43ee-bea1-a1d74dbcc924	2	Plot twist doesn't work.
/m/antebellum	d802f906-1f59-43ee-bea1-a1d74dbcc924	2.5	I loved the plot twist and... Yes, I loved the plot twist
/m/antebellum	d802f906-1f59-43ee-bea1-a1d74dbcc924	1	Naw who greenlit this mess? Give me my damn time back….
/m/shes_in_portland	34e39809-6662-3b1e-8198-2268562e67b6	2.5	title caught my eye, and the short synopsis seemed promising. really liked the filming locations, would have liked to have seen them even more than we did. for those reasons i found it was watchable. not trying to be mean or negative, but you do not have to look too hard to find a better movie.
/m/shes_in_portland	34e39809-6662-3b1e-8198-2268562e67b6	3.5	Dives deep into relationships and marriages and navigates it all with exceptional graceful dialogue and strong acting that kept it on track. Some beautiful shots. Worth a watch for sure.
/m/shes_in_portland	34e39809-6662-3b1e-8198-2268562e67b6	2	Every line felt like it was been read off the script.  The actors never inhabited their dull characters.  The central idea was good but it felt so wooden and was shot like a cheesy commercial.  I quit at 31mins. Room for improvement.
/m/shes_in_portland	34e39809-6662-3b1e-8198-2268562e67b6	5	I really enjoyed this movie. Seemed to be relatively by-the-books at first. But it develops into a more unusual, intriguing, and inspiring film the longer you watch it.
/m/shes_in_portland	34e39809-6662-3b1e-8198-2268562e67b6	2.5	I didn’t mind this movie at all . But it really had me thinking the entire time, am I loser or was this completely unrealistic 2.7. I think I really lost it when the one girl fell in love literally with 24 and crying about the guy not leaving his wife . The married guy is also a scummy douche
/m/shes_in_portland	34e39809-6662-3b1e-8198-2268562e67b6	0.5	What a waste of time! This movie was decent up until the awful ending. I really disliked the ending.
/m/shes_in_portland	34e39809-6662-3b1e-8198-2268562e67b6	5	What a refreshing movie of love and bringing balance to self.  Beautiful cinematography, PCH scenery stunning!
/m/shes_in_portland	34e39809-6662-3b1e-8198-2268562e67b6	5	Overall it was a great movie! I was utterly surprised with how the one friend who needed the actual help wasn't the one that needed the help. Beautiful shots and scenery of PCH.
/m/shes_in_portland	34e39809-6662-3b1e-8198-2268562e67b6	5	The movie is awesome! Love the story. Love the cinematography. Great acting.  I will watch this film again and again. I look forward to a sequel.
/m/shes_in_portland	34e39809-6662-3b1e-8198-2268562e67b6	5	Fantastic scenery -- see the West Coast as it was before all the fires.  Great music.  Good exploration of male mid life crisis while touching on just about all the current cultural hot topics -- without beating you about the head on any of them.  They come up naturally as part and parcel of the life experiences of the characters -- which I think makes this an important film historically.  Society is changing more rapidly than in the past.  50 years, 100 years from now when people want a better understanding of what it was like to live during this time of change, what the issues were, this movie will give them a snapshot while entertaining them at the same time.
/m/the_racer_2020	cb1fe994-0e63-3441-9233-8bc491c7cef5	3.5	Surprisingly enjoyable. Not one I'd usually seek out to watch, just happened to be starting and I couldn't reach the remote. Gave an insight into the world of cycling and doping. Only thing I didn't like was the ending as it wasn't really a conclusion as such or an explanation.
/m/the_racer_2020	cb1fe994-0e63-3441-9233-8bc491c7cef5	5	A film that draws one into the normalised world of doping, as well as the obsessive nature of professional cycling.  Dark, depressing, but oddly inspiring at times.
/m/the_racer_2020	cb1fe994-0e63-3441-9233-8bc491c7cef5	1	I've never reviewed a movie before, partly because I don't want to waste my time. However; this film wasted 96 minutes of my life which I will never get back.  Pointless plot and ending, horrendous acting and filming.   I would rather watch paint dry.
/m/the_racer_2020	cb1fe994-0e63-3441-9233-8bc491c7cef5	5	You dont have to like cycling to enjoy this movie! The story twists and turns like a viper, constantly intriguing, thrilling and emotional. Check it out!
/m/the_racer_2020	cb1fe994-0e63-3441-9233-8bc491c7cef5	4	A gruesome and raw story of the dark side of professional cycling , the main character Dom Chabol finely played by Louis Talpe  wrestles with the personal issues issues  of identity ,success ,ageing and the future against a backdrop of a professional cycling circus etched in dingy hotels , basic food and  pharmaceutical centrifuges. It is riveting with excellent support from Matteo Simoni as the narcissistic team leader Tartare and Iain Glenn as the wizened ex pro soigneur
/m/the_racer_2020	cb1fe994-0e63-3441-9233-8bc491c7cef5	3	A racer who struggled 3 days earlier before his race and almost lost his career, not a comedy though but a real life struggle of each athlete that happens
/m/the_artists_wife	1a09296c-d539-30d5-a5ca-96865a2f72be	2.5	Bruce Dern disappears for large swaths of the movie so the story can concentrate on Lena Olin reigniting her painting career.  Dern's character is much more interesting.
/m/the_artists_wife	1a09296c-d539-30d5-a5ca-96865a2f72be	4	A moving, if sometimes slightly disjointed look at the life of a wife who gave up her pursuit to be an artist to support the painting career of her talented, famous and affluent but capricious and egotistical husband, a challenge made all the more difficult by the onset of Alzheimer's disease, making him more volatile and unpredictable than ever. The dynamics of a woman torn between wanting to support her beloved and pull away to attend to her own needs are examined in multiple permutations, presenting a profile of a character frustrated while attempting to be conciliatory in multiple regards. The superb lead performances by Lena Olin and Bruce Dern, backed by a fine supporting cast, really make this picture, helping it shine even when its sometimes-meandering narrative lets them down. A worthwhile candidate for awards season, especially in the acting categories.
/m/the_artists_wife	1a09296c-d539-30d5-a5ca-96865a2f72be	3	Good actoing, trite plot.
/m/teenage_badass	599dcd66-ad09-3ed3-a9db-5a0e4e90c3d2	4	A good indie band movie is the best 3.8
/m/misbehaviour	e3e32477-e4a3-3c0f-8b94-b03a13f9d590	4	I know it's hard to believe that a film directed by, written by and starring women about a 'women's issue' is derided on the internet, but here we are. In reality, this is a really good film about two different sides of injustice, and how those searching for liberation engage with each other when two just agendas might appear to be in conflict. Excellent performances, and the light comic tone doesn't lessen the impact.
/m/misbehaviour	e3e32477-e4a3-3c0f-8b94-b03a13f9d590	3.5	Flawed, but its energetic and vivid story-telling  alongside stellar performances achieve creating a compelling film that benefits from important and timely themes.
/m/misbehaviour	e3e32477-e4a3-3c0f-8b94-b03a13f9d590	0.5	A movie with a stellar cast and based around such a great story could only be commandeered by a radical left group of disillusioned man haters in Hollywood.   If the filmmakers had focused more on racial equality during the time period and the significanceof the events the film depicts, it could have had such a lasting impact with such a talented cast. Unfortunately, instead, it was crafted into a tool for a misguided cult to take shots at a fictional 21st century Civil rights issue known as the patriarchal society.  What a colossal disappointment.
/m/misbehaviour	e3e32477-e4a3-3c0f-8b94-b03a13f9d590	2.5	'Misbehaviour' tells three different stories intermingled.  The centerpiece is the 1970 Miss World competition and just about everything offshoots from that.  Bob Hope loves women and the women's liberation movement loves women's rights.  Greg Kinnear portrays Hope.  Well sometimes he does.  Other times he's just himself with some distracting makeup.  While I didn't know anything about this story, it's safe yet fine.  It's not deep and eager to make you feel good, so much so, it takes away from what in my opinion the film should have been about.  Also, there's a lot of filler here.  Can't anyone write a movie for a big studio?  A person of color winning is almost glossed over, which may have been the goal, but it didn't work for me.  Final Score: 5.0/10
/m/misbehaviour	e3e32477-e4a3-3c0f-8b94-b03a13f9d590	3	Misbehaviour is a solidly executed —- albeit formulaic —- retelling of a grossly under-explored part of our history, and boasts enough spectacle and feel-good moments to stay watchable —— even compelling thanks to the strength of its powerhouse female cast. Though unlike the strong women at its centre, it's a shame that those behind the camera quite often lack the strength to reach below the subject's sensationalistic surface.  Iroh's grade: C
/m/misbehaviour	e3e32477-e4a3-3c0f-8b94-b03a13f9d590	5	An important moment in social justice. Every step is important in making the world more fair and just and this movie does a great job of telling the story of one of the steps.
/m/misbehaviour	e3e32477-e4a3-3c0f-8b94-b03a13f9d590	1.5	Predictable and not funny.
/m/misbehaviour	e3e32477-e4a3-3c0f-8b94-b03a13f9d590	3.5	Misbehavior had all the potential to be a brilliant female empowering biopic but it settled for being a dramady instead. Still there's a lot to admire and enjoy in its talented cast and presentation of a crucial moment in women's liberation.
/m/misbehaviour	e3e32477-e4a3-3c0f-8b94-b03a13f9d590	0.5	Misbehavior fails to be funny, and some of the acting is very bad.
/m/misbehaviour	e3e32477-e4a3-3c0f-8b94-b03a13f9d590	5	Fantastic cast and the movie was unexpectedly amazing. Really enjoyed the performances of Gugu Mbatha Raw and Keeley Hawes. Definitely a great family movie that shouldn't be missed. Great job!
/m/red_shoes_and_the_seven_dwarfs	16e5738c-7923-3478-8fa1-ac60bbf85544	5	Adorei o filme. Quando li que estavam criticando o filme por gordofobia, fiquei receosa de ver o filme, mas eu amei. A história é simples e longe de ser gordofobico, o filme transmite bem a mensagem de que devemos ser felizes com o nosso corpo. Branca de Neve não estava insatisfeita com o seu corpo no início do filme, embora, talvez, a sua figura magra tenha sido um desejo subconsciente que a árvore lhe concedeu, mas a forma como o filme terminou foi legal. As promoções foram negativas, mas o filmes vale a pena e está longe de ser gordofobico.
/m/red_shoes_and_the_seven_dwarfs	16e5738c-7923-3478-8fa1-ac60bbf85544	2	A somewhat entertaining "meh"... And btw, almost at the end of the movie Artur calls Merlin a "bitch" haha xD
/m/red_shoes_and_the_seven_dwarfs	16e5738c-7923-3478-8fa1-ac60bbf85544	5	A lot of people might think this movie teaches about the wrong things, like you "need to be skinny" or you "need to be a bit bigger" but the point of this movie is that your can find true love through self acceptance and love in yourself,  first. Snow white always loved herself and her strength, she learns that the two parts of herself are both perfection in their own ways, the same with Merlin. I think this is a fantastic movie and people that may struggle with self love should learn a thing or two from this movie❤️❤️❤️
/m/red_shoes_and_the_seven_dwarfs	16e5738c-7923-3478-8fa1-ac60bbf85544	5	Gorgeous Animation throughout this forgotten classic from South Korea. Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarfs is a must see for people who enjoy reading fairy tales.
/m/red_shoes_and_the_seven_dwarfs	16e5738c-7923-3478-8fa1-ac60bbf85544	5	Es una buena parodia de cuentos de Adas la cual adapta diferentes tramas de varias películas , incluyendo una trama romántica bien manejada con una buena moraleja.
/m/red_shoes_and_the_seven_dwarfs	16e5738c-7923-3478-8fa1-ac60bbf85544	5	The trailer didn't represent the beauty of the movie. It's a clique but in the end she's her strong self. Beauty really does shine from the inside out. It's a 10/10, I would 100% watch it again!
/m/red_shoes_and_the_seven_dwarfs	16e5738c-7923-3478-8fa1-ac60bbf85544	5	I loved this movie! Good messages and morals, a feel-good movie with a good story and a great ending!
/m/red_shoes_and_the_seven_dwarfs	16e5738c-7923-3478-8fa1-ac60bbf85544	5	I found this Snow White rendition to be quite entertaining and gave the dwarves more personality than they usually get. It's also really good at portraying how to accept yourself on the inside and out
/m/red_shoes_and_the_seven_dwarfs	16e5738c-7923-3478-8fa1-ac60bbf85544	5	It was beautiful! The plot is so heart-warming and the song choice is very fitting. I love it
/m/red_shoes_and_the_seven_dwarfs	16e5738c-7923-3478-8fa1-ac60bbf85544	5	I used rotten tomatos for the first time just to chip in and give this a full 5 star rating amongst the bad ratings. Most of the bad ratings haven't even watched the movie. This movie is beautifully made, has a compelling story, and a moving ending. This is a must watch I don't regret watching it this is my favorite animated film.
/m/ottolenghi_and_the_cakes_of_versailles	6983bdf0-e58e-37e1-963e-292b0521af47	2	A failed attempt at food porn that has seemingly never seen Masterchef.  We live in a tv market saturated by food-porn of various flavours, genres and levels of drama.  It's everywhere.  If you're going to bring us something with such a grandiose title, then you'd better be bringing an A-game.  And this isn't.  I'm not sure what this thinks it's bringing to whom?  It is quite scattershot in its approach.  It never made my mouth water.
/m/ottolenghi_and_the_cakes_of_versailles	6983bdf0-e58e-37e1-963e-292b0521af47	5	I watched this after waking up at 3:30 a.m. and was utterly entranced.  Food and culture and art and when will they do this again.
/m/ottolenghi_and_the_cakes_of_versailles	6983bdf0-e58e-37e1-963e-292b0521af47	4	It was fascinating. I saw a different side to Yotam, and learned more about his move into the food industry. Great views of the Met too. I would highly recommend this documentary.
/m/ive_got_issues	df4c3339-dcce-374e-a684-368fb333d448	5	Offbeat and oddball vignettes about struggle! It skewers gurus, academic discourse, job interviews, the politics of corporate life, Renaissance Faire entertainers at community centers, non-verbal communication, pet mourners, marriage, couch potatoes, and some things that defy easy description or are open to interpretation. Much makes little sense but it's not trying hard to make sense. There's a bit of call-back jokes; if you're paying attention they really work. The ensemble cast is great – they have enough range to play vastly different characters struggling with serious relationship problems to the mundane, to that not-so-consequential but desperate loneliness of realizing you locked your keys in your car or a clogged sink. One of my faves was a clogged sink telling a guy he's not living up to his potential. If you're old enough to remember the zaniness of Kentucky Fried Movie and liked it, this may be for you. If you like plot and a continuing story line you'll find this tedious. If you do like this - check out Maria Thayer in "Night of the Living Deb," a hilarious take on zombie apocalypses comedies.
/m/ive_got_issues	df4c3339-dcce-374e-a684-368fb333d448	2.5	I really wanted to like this and I’m down with the weird but there has to be some type of direction to make it moderately worthwhile to follow 2.4
/m/dtf	5ac8bfd4-0d76-3ba7-ac61-82ab2fd5471b	5	Great for what it is, which is a view into the world of sex addiction and pilots. Very eye-opening, and in fact quite informative on how not to be a piece of shit. All you have to do is watch the main guy and not do anything or say anything he does.
/m/dtf	5ac8bfd4-0d76-3ba7-ac61-82ab2fd5471b	5	Quite disturbing regarding the lifestyle of pilots. Worth watching if for no other reason than that. Also somewhat emblematic of our hedonistic society in general
/m/dtf	5ac8bfd4-0d76-3ba7-ac61-82ab2fd5471b	5	Crazy, wild and one of the most engagingly raw and unfiltered docs I've seen in a long time!
/m/alone_2020_2	251fcf6e-1c2c-3942-a10a-204ec4b7d86d	0.5	I usually give movies the benefit of the doubt. This was one of the absolute worst movies I've ever seen. First it starts off with her being the driver we all hate and it doesn't get better. You are supposed to cheer for the main character and I find myself thinking that she deserves whatever happens to her. When the man she tailgates and tried to pass on a double line comes to her and acts creepy as hell, we're screaming at her to drive away. When she finally does she gets a flat tire and sees him coming. She jumps in her car but when he comes at her she doesn't even try to open the door and he takes her down. The entire movie is filled with stupid stuff like with with a horrible actress as the main character. I have no idea how anyone could give this awful movie more than 1/2 star.
/m/alone_2020_2	251fcf6e-1c2c-3942-a10a-204ec4b7d86d	5	first time id say dont listen to the audience reviews, super intense film from start to finish and the main character actually makes smart decisions. Amazing movie
/m/alone_2020_2	251fcf6e-1c2c-3942-a10a-204ec4b7d86d	0.5	Worst movie I've ever seen. One dimensional villain and idiot protagonist.
/m/alone_2020_2	251fcf6e-1c2c-3942-a10a-204ec4b7d86d	2	Quite a silly sequence of events to set the plot.
/m/alone_2020_2	251fcf6e-1c2c-3942-a10a-204ec4b7d86d	1	this is such a great movie if you want to know everything not to do when being stalked. it's another movie where the female prey does absolutely nothing to help herself. this movie was so predictable, and of course, the main character had no mace, no knife, no gun, nothing. it had an okay ending, but that doesn't take away from the fact that everything about this movie was horrible. watch if you want to be disappointed in almost every scene. :D
/m/alone_2020_2	251fcf6e-1c2c-3942-a10a-204ec4b7d86d	3	Another foray into the genre where you can only get immersed if you suspend the belief that a woman travelling on her own would ignore so many red flags. It's well put-together and the fact it takes its time in the opening act is absolutely commendable. It descends into gratuitous misery as the protagonist struggles to escape her captor who holds the remarkable ability to zone-in on her location in the wilderness with the kind of precision presumably only accessible to governments. This is definitely better than average, and it does attempt to subvert the usual "don't do that" audience reactions, but for the set-pieces to work, unbelievable lapses in judgement need to be made. Decent, but we're still crying out for a film to get the believable angle right.
/m/alone_2020_2	251fcf6e-1c2c-3942-a10a-204ec4b7d86d	5	Different take on the kidnap victim. The guy has a very sinister bundi feel in that he appears normal to family, but seems to get off on terror and torture.  Good story line, acting, overall definitely worth a watch, mostly set in forests of America somewhere
/m/alone_2020_2	251fcf6e-1c2c-3942-a10a-204ec4b7d86d	1	I'm chocked with the 90% rate from this website! I watched because of the good rating. This movie was so Boring. Cliche. Nonsense history and the main character is so dumb that makes you feel dumb too. None of her actions was believable and he acted like a God! He knew everything! Lol
/m/alone_2020_2	251fcf6e-1c2c-3942-a10a-204ec4b7d86d	0.5	One of the worst movies ever. I've never seen someone portrayed as so dumb. Made me rage the whole way.
/m/alone_2020_2	251fcf6e-1c2c-3942-a10a-204ec4b7d86d	0.5	It's enough of these movies with cheap emotions and the same plot. A totally wasted of time. 2/10
/m/welcome_to_sudden_death	139f912d-1a05-37c8-b8fa-48583f3f11cd	4.5	It started off pretty sus but pretty quickly turned into a pretty excellent Hong Kong style action film. Pretty good setpiece fight scenes matched with kickass music. Was kinda funny too. I liked it.
/m/welcome_to_sudden_death	139f912d-1a05-37c8-b8fa-48583f3f11cd	0.5	Irritating and bad. Where are the alien invaders when you need them? They could have destroyed the entire cast in the first few minutes.
/m/welcome_to_sudden_death	139f912d-1a05-37c8-b8fa-48583f3f11cd	1	So bad. Not as in a "so bad it's good" kind of way, just really, really bad on every level.  It sounded like it might be fun in a Diehard ripoff kind of way, but no. Just no. Don't waste your time with this one.
/m/welcome_to_sudden_death	139f912d-1a05-37c8-b8fa-48583f3f11cd	1.5	Acting is poor. Script poor. Plot predictable.
/m/welcome_to_sudden_death	139f912d-1a05-37c8-b8fa-48583f3f11cd	2.5	Michael Jai White's"Welcome to Sudden Death" is a low budget, reimagining of the 1990's Jean-Claude Van Damme film of similar title.  This comedic-action film released this week on Netflix, DVD, and other streaming services.     While our request for a screening copy of the film was ignored it did not impact my impression of the film.   The movie is a fun, fast paced action film with a simple, and familiar, story.   Highly skilled, overqualified, security guard, White, is forced into a mission to single-handedly save his family and an arena of innocent basketball fans.  The heart of the film is Jai White's charisma, likability, and Taekwondo founded fighting skills.   I enjoyed the fight scenes very much in this one.  While I would not consider the film one of "The Black Dragon's" best, it is a highly watchable martial arts, action thriller.   For film buffs, it pays homage to Van Damme's Sudden Death, Bruce Willis' Die Hard films, as well as John Frankenheimer's, Black Sunday.  R – for some bloody violence, and language
/m/welcome_to_sudden_death	139f912d-1a05-37c8-b8fa-48583f3f11cd	1.5	Everything in this movie comes across as ultra-cheap, which is kind of a shame as this barebones of this remake could have been much better with just a little more money as the star and the screenplay are fine. 1 1/2 stars out 5.
/m/welcome_to_sudden_death	139f912d-1a05-37c8-b8fa-48583f3f11cd	5	Awesome Action movie. 10/10 - would recommend
/m/welcome_to_sudden_death	139f912d-1a05-37c8-b8fa-48583f3f11cd	5	This is an Action packed movie in all avenues Star Power 5/5 Sound track 5/5 Fight Choreography 5/5 Comedy beats 5/5  I could watch this movie multiple times without blinking. 10/10 - would recommend
/m/welcome_to_sudden_death	139f912d-1a05-37c8-b8fa-48583f3f11cd	2	A cheesy version of 'Die Hard'.  They even reference DH in the movie... it is that obvious.  Just plain goofy.
/m/welcome_to_sudden_death	139f912d-1a05-37c8-b8fa-48583f3f11cd	1	Come on Michael you should have done better but this is 2020 worst movie of the year.
/m/no_escape_2020	e6385838-be15-4142-833b-e06ad47c2242	5	One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Nice twits and keeps you watching all the way through! Awesome watch
/m/no_escape_2020	e6385838-be15-4142-833b-e06ad47c2242	4.5	Actually pretty good.
/m/no_escape_2020	e6385838-be15-4142-833b-e06ad47c2242	3.5	This is one of those movies that just came out of no where while watching Television one day and I really enjoyed watching it!
/m/no_escape_2020	e6385838-be15-4142-833b-e06ad47c2242	3.5	Honestly the funniest movie I've watched in a while. Went to the movies and saw it with my friends and we laughed the whole way through. It doesn't really do its job as a horror movie, but it's definitely a great comedy.
/m/no_escape_2020	e6385838-be15-4142-833b-e06ad47c2242	1.5	Another escape room movie, but this one is in Russia. This was like a really boring third of a movie, then escape room stuff, and with bits of Saw and Hostel elements to it towards the end. There was also a lot that was in Russian and it would have been nice to know what they were saying. The end was a huge twist and didn't make much sense at all on how it worked out.
/m/no_escape_2020	e6385838-be15-4142-833b-e06ad47c2242	5	Better than Expected Honestly, I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. I've seen a lot of bad horror movies, and I didn't think the writer/director's previous movie Escape Room was all that strong in the script department. I also read almost nothing but negative reviews for this movie and just wasn't expecting much. But I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.  The cinematography looks nice, and the acting is really solid all around. Keegan Allen gives a great performance as the lead. That last scene - chills. You can really feel for his character.  The dialogue is also good. There were actually a few moments where the dialogue was surprisingly organic, and you really got the sense that these characters have been good friends for a long time. There's a couple of cheesy vlogger lines that are generic and played up, but that's kind of the point, and for the most part those few vlogging scenes work well. The social media overlay was also well done, clean, and easy to digest. Additionally, there are some Easter Eggs if you know what you're looking for. Cole is following several people from the production of the movie like Will Wernick and Jeff and Kelly Delson. I thought that was a fun touch.  I saw some critique of the lack of subtitles. There was a significant amount of Russian in this film and not a word is captioned. Personally, I didn't mind. You can basically understand what they're saying just through context - or so it seems at least. I admittedly don't speak Russian.  I've also seen people say that the plot is unoriginal and a bad rip off of Saw, Hostel, etc. While some of the escape room torture puzzles are familiar, there's a lot from this movie that I haven't seen done in exactly the same way before. I actually thought the plot for this movie was fairly strong, much better than Wernick's previous Escape Room (to which this movie bears little resemblance, despite involving escape rooms and previously in production being titled Escape Room: Moscow). There's some good twists, and the plot keeps its suspense through most of the movie. The pacing was fine for me.  I won't get into spoilers, but there are some logistical plot holes that end up not making much sense. By the end of the movie, you spend a lot of time reflecting and going "Wait, how did they know/do/expect that?" and that brings my review down a couple stars. But it's nothing egregious as I've seen some people complain about. It's your standard horror movie bad logic, which is seen enough to be tolerable by people who spend a lot of time watching the genre.  Overall, this is actually a solid movie. It's not my movie of the year or anything, but it's a decent thriller that put a new spin on the genre and did it pretty well. I'd recommend it.
/m/no_escape_2020	e6385838-be15-4142-833b-e06ad47c2242	3.5	watch it to the end, you'll see. but the entitled douche can suck my #$%^$

/m/all_in_the_fight_for_democracy	6548c186-652d-460c-bd89-1b541888972b	0.5	Clarification Number One: It's like anything Michael Moore creates, IOW it's not a documentary, it's a film. A documentary implies objective POVs, equal time and unbiased focus, exposing both the good and bad aspects regardless of how they affect the primary theme. e.g. See the Dutch study negating Bowling for Columbine, use of shock-journalism, editing and skewed & loaded imagery/words.  This film takes a similar approach, hyperfocused from start to finish, it's goal was & remains to influence Base Voter's and reaffirming Emotional Base Voters. This has nothing to do with the character, her skin colour or her sex. Fear of cancellation or retribution explains the high marks, the overall intention explaining the release date & lifting the Paywall before Prime-only (Amazon missing out on $$$? That's a first) It was a long IE/EC type advert only allowed to run during the 10-Day IE Season before Election Day, technically a direct FECA Violation, but who cares, right? It got ppl to the polls and created another ProgDEM device used to target specific demographics. BTW The Constitution does not grant a "Right to Vote". It is a Privilege. You need to look at State Constitutions, all allowed to vary (for now) before Right us in-play. Based on the unfair application and bypassing FECA Laws, plus towing the line, makes this unethical, immoral and failing by default.
/m/all_in_the_fight_for_democracy	6548c186-652d-460c-bd89-1b541888972b	3.5	No matter where one stands politically, most of us (or so I would like to hope) believe in a sense of fairness when it comes to our elections. However, as this documentary from directors Lisa Cortes and Liz Garbus details, the country is increasingly under siege from a growing campaign to deliberately suppress voter rights in states across the nation, exposing the myriad techniques being employed by self-interested parties to achieve that result. In telling its story, the film chronicles the history of voter rights from the days of America's birth through Reconstruction to the Jim Crow Era and eventually the Civil Rights Movement. The picture illustrates the efforts of various constituencies, from African-Americans to women to Asian-Americans and Latinos, in winning and protecting what's widely considered one of the fundamental rights of living in a democracy. But it then goes on to show insidious initiatives to turn back the clock, as exemplified by a number of emerging state legislative and policy actions, most notably the tactics used to manipulate the outcome of the 2018 Georgia governor's race and the efforts to derail the campaign of Democratic candidate Stacy Abrams. This offering thus presents a reasoned and damning look at voter suppression efforts, emphatically delivering an urgent message we all need to hear if we hope to preserve our republic. However, despite the importance of this, the film could stand to be less partisan and more even-handed in tone, especially when it comes to balancing its coverage of which states have implemented voter suppression measures, some of which have arisen in some seemingly unlikely jurisdictions beyond those that have surfaced in more readily expected locales. What's more, "All In" says virtually nothing about what needs to happen even if voter rights are sufficiently protected -- ensuring that our elections produce victors who are actually able to do something to get the nation back on track once they're in office. That could easily be a topic for another film, though one can't deny this consideration is inherently tied to being able to cast our votes in the first place, and, on this point, the picture is silent. Still, I suppose we have to start somewhere, and preserving the opportunity to help bring about such an outcome is essential if we ever hope to have a chance to attain that larger goal.
/m/all_in_the_fight_for_democracy	6548c186-652d-460c-bd89-1b541888972b	5	brilliant! an absolute must see.
/m/all_in_the_fight_for_democracy	6548c186-652d-460c-bd89-1b541888972b	5	RATING: A+  Director: Lisa Cortes & Liz Garbus All In: The Fight for Democracy is mainly about the voting and all the difficulties it comes with in the US. Too show all of this ( including history, statistics etc. ) the Filmmakers chose to use animation and as I think this was a brilliant choice. This documentary is really exciting and you really can't bring yourself to pause it to go to the toilet let alone turn it off to continue watching at another point in the day. This film is really eye opening!
/m/all_in_the_fight_for_democracy	6548c186-652d-460c-bd89-1b541888972b	4.5	Well done documentary on voter suppression. Very informative.

/m/all_in_the_fight_for_democracy	6548c186-652d-460c-bd89-1b541888972b	4	A very important film that's well worth seeing for anyone interested in American politics. It's really so depressing to see how effective voter suppression is over there. The confederates may have lost their right to keep slaves, but they and their political descendants have clearly done everything they can to stop black people and other ethnic minorities from voting.
/m/cats_and_dogs_3_paws_unite	53854bcd-d18c-32b3-9593-0e943df68e99	1	It's not often a movie is ruined in the first 30 seconds, but this film succeeds in doing so! It telegraphs exactly the type of infantile humor you will be seeing. None of the charm of the original.
/m/cats_and_dogs_3_paws_unite	53854bcd-d18c-32b3-9593-0e943df68e99	5	easily one of the best movies i've ever seen. give this bad boy a watch - you'll regret it if you don't!
/m/cats_and_dogs_3_paws_unite	53854bcd-d18c-32b3-9593-0e943df68e99	0.5	Annoying cats, annoying actors, and dumb  plot! Seriously, I only watched this because I figured I watched the first 2 I might as well watch this one to finish the franchise; skip it! Seriously, don't waste your time with this rubbish.
/m/cats_and_dogs_3_paws_unite	53854bcd-d18c-32b3-9593-0e943df68e99	0.5	Was unbearable to watch it is made so cheaply it is cringeworthy. There is no humour our kids did not enjoy it all. The move was sadly disappointing from the start to the end. I can't believe they would make the movie watch it and think it would be fine to release it!
/m/cats_and_dogs_3_paws_unite	53854bcd-d18c-32b3-9593-0e943df68e99	0.5	It failed at every level the actors were very poor and watching it was really uncomfortable. it's non stop disappointing the whole way through there was no action nor comedy and poorly put together if you are looking to entertain the family do not watch this.
/m/cats_and_dogs_3_paws_unite	53854bcd-d18c-32b3-9593-0e943df68e99	0.5	IT WAS SO BAD. The acting is ok but the dialogue made it terrible. It hasn't the opportunity to be a great movie but they failed. It is way worse than the other Cats Vs Dogs. I would definitely not watch
/m/cats_and_dogs_3_paws_unite	53854bcd-d18c-32b3-9593-0e943df68e99	0.5	If you are a fan of Cats and Dogs 1 and Cats and Dogs 2, do not watch this movie as it gets rid of everything that makes the first two films good and I mean EVERYTHING including all the older characters such as Lou and Mr Tinkles. Everything about this film sucks ultimate balls except for most of the acting/voice acting and the musical number at the end.
/m/cats_and_dogs_3_paws_unite	53854bcd-d18c-32b3-9593-0e943df68e99	2	No es que las primeras películas fueran buenas, por que no lo son,  sin embargo eran divertidas para toda la familia, y cada una puede ser considerada como un "placer culpable" , sin embargo a pesar de que deja la moraleja de que hay que separarse un poco del celular, casi nada funciona en la tercera y supuestamente última entrega, es demasiado infantil, saca un par de carcajadas pero los demás chistes son malos, hay muy pocos animales que ya no cuentan con el pequeño grado de irreverencia que antes y las actuaciones del elenco humano son flojas, tal vez entretenga un rato a los niños más pequeños, pero es por mucho la peor de las tres.
/m/cats_and_dogs_3_paws_unite	53854bcd-d18c-32b3-9593-0e943df68e99	5	A masterpiece. Cats and dogs 3 was a life changing experience I'm sure to remember. The complex character arcs, expert camera work and powerful statement made on the current geopolitical landscape came together to create a film that would rival Schindler's List. Here's hoping for cats and dogs 4.
/m/cats_and_dogs_3_paws_unite	53854bcd-d18c-32b3-9593-0e943df68e99	0.5	I thought the movie was cute except what it implied about black cats being bad luck if they cross your path. That is a really bad thing to be teaching kids, its not true, its superstition that very unfortunately people believe. The sad truth is black cats are the least adopted, the most abused, neglected, euthanized and abandoned of all cat breeds & colors. Our shelters and their foster homes are filled with them because movies, TV shows, books etc., incite this horrible thing. I will definitely tell my fellow cat lovers groups, and EVERY one I know to not watch or buy this movie.
/m/sno_babies	0ddd8234-7ddd-4262-b5cf-a39b5a0b87de	4	A very painful movie.. Plot can be a bit cluttered and messy at times. Saved for me by solid acting, soundtrack, and a few especially powerful moments. I'll look forward to more movies, both by Better Noise Films, and also ones starring Katie Kelly!
/m/sno_babies	0ddd8234-7ddd-4262-b5cf-a39b5a0b87de	5	Most movies are boring. this one was not at all. Really sad story. Every time the Rotten Tomatoes critics score is 50+ % below the audience score, the "critics" should receive an electric shock. Actually the most memorable movies are the ones where the score difference is that high. Saw it on Amazon.
/m/sno_babies	0ddd8234-7ddd-4262-b5cf-a39b5a0b87de	0.5	They must be paying people to write these audience reviews. Movie is dreck.
/m/sno_babies	0ddd8234-7ddd-4262-b5cf-a39b5a0b87de	5	Powerful, gripping, raw! The characters grab at your soul and pull you in to their story.  Everyone should see this movie and realize the heroine epidemic wrecking so many lives in this country. I fully support the message this film is telling.
/m/sno_babies	0ddd8234-7ddd-4262-b5cf-a39b5a0b87de	5	I did not expect to love this movie, and I did!  Everything felt so real.  I was on the edge of my seat for most of it but the last 25 minutes was insane.  It's so well done.  I almost felt like I was watching a really good horror film.  The acting is strong and the lead is AMAZING!  This movie is great.  End of story.
/m/sno_babies	0ddd8234-7ddd-4262-b5cf-a39b5a0b87de	4.5	What I liked most about this movie is that it pulled no punches from start to finish. You could feel all the start that this was going to be ride that will haunt you for days.
/m/sno_babies	0ddd8234-7ddd-4262-b5cf-a39b5a0b87de	5	BRAVO!! Mike Walsh & Bridget Smith for having the guts and the talent to make such a Paramount Film.  People all of the country are in denial and don't want to believe this actually happening in their back yards ...but it is!!  I am in recovery from herion and worked for a sometime at a harm reduction space in Kensington and witnessed so many come in for safety from all walks of life nurses, lawyers, children of police detectives etc.  Bridget said it  "Addiction doesn't discriminate"   The rapes, sex trafficking, violence, incarceration that people experience while in their active addiction has a Traumatic domino effect not only on the lives of those suffering but on our Society as a whole, but the Isolation, shame and stigma... KILLS!  Katie Kelly's withdrawal scene was perfect and she was able to display how Powerful "Fentanyl" really is...regardless of the consequences!
/m/sno_babies	0ddd8234-7ddd-4262-b5cf-a39b5a0b87de	5	First and foremost the film was very, very well Written, Directed and Shot. After watching the movie, you could tell that alot of research went into this movie because it conveyed a very, very powerful message in a Real, Raw and Relevant way. This movie will definitely move its audience. The Acting was phenomenal. As the entire Cast did fantastic job, the leads Katie Kelly (Kristen) and Paola Andino (Hannah) captivated the audience with their performances as they lead the way. Everyone conveyed very, very believably real and passionate characters. This movie is definitely one for the ages as it will assist and/or serve to perhaps save lives and/or impact lives due to the subject matter. Kudos to entire Production Team, Cast and the Crew. This is an Absolute Must See Movie!
/m/sno_babies	0ddd8234-7ddd-4262-b5cf-a39b5a0b87de	5	This film is amazing. Ripped from today's' headlines, this is a heart-rending, poignant but not sentimental look at the opiod crisis in America. It follows a suburban high school girl, from her introduction to "oxy" to her spiral down the rabbit-hole of heroin addiction towards disaster. The acting is superb and you cannot look away from the screen even at the harshest depictions of addiction. The soundtrack is spot on and increases the tension in just the right places. I felt totally submerged in the life and desperation of the addict.  This film will move anyone with a heart, and will stay with you long after your first viewing.  A must-see!
/m/sno_babies	0ddd8234-7ddd-4262-b5cf-a39b5a0b87de	5	As a mother who lost a child to addiction, this movie hits close to home. You are so busy with life and miss all the early signs and then it's too late. The message at the end is something every single person needs to hear.
/m/murder_in_the_woods	08aa19b2-8f9d-31ab-89e1-7869a6436950	1.5	A witless low-budget riff on the Scream formula features dumb characters making bad decisions and a tepid twist.  Danny Trejo's great, as always, for the three minutes he's on screen.
/m/murder_in_the_woods	08aa19b2-8f9d-31ab-89e1-7869a6436950	3.5	Okay, objectively speaking... The acting was good. The directing was good. The set was believable, cluttered house, like a normal person lived there.  The story had promise, but no wow moments. The script... awful.  When stalked by a murderer fight or flight kicks in. Survival mode is what gear you're in. NO ONE thinks about making out in case they die. You're focused on surviving. Maybe you might think about a loved one you wish you could see again or something like that. Inserting sex scenes is really the mark of amateur. It works in silly movies like Dogma, when the character is just an idiot already. Some of it made zero sense. Who's doing the shooting?  And you know there's always that filler of people doing stupid things like running outside alone in the dark or out in the open. Then hey, lets all just stand here on the porch and discuss this.  The guy who was obnoxious was the most believable actor. He seemed like he had experience. The others were also good. The hoochie chick was a bit too over the top though.
/m/murder_in_the_woods	08aa19b2-8f9d-31ab-89e1-7869a6436950	3	We knew who was the killer at the middle of the movie
/m/murder_in_the_woods	08aa19b2-8f9d-31ab-89e1-7869a6436950	5	Danny Trejo never disappoints!
/m/murder_in_the_woods	08aa19b2-8f9d-31ab-89e1-7869a6436950	5	Clever slasher. Keeps you guessing until the end. It was more fun than I thought it would be.
/m/murder_in_the_woods	08aa19b2-8f9d-31ab-89e1-7869a6436950	5	What got me to watch this movie was Roeper's review. It's spot on. Great laughs and jumps.
/m/murder_in_the_woods	08aa19b2-8f9d-31ab-89e1-7869a6436950	5	A fun, campy slasher... feels like it could have been released in the 80s. Good homage to the classics.
/m/murder_in_the_woods	08aa19b2-8f9d-31ab-89e1-7869a6436950	0.5	how on earth does this have an 82% this was the worst movie ive ever seen
/m/murder_in_the_woods	08aa19b2-8f9d-31ab-89e1-7869a6436950	5	The ending! I was like OMG!!! Ya'll got to check it out.
/m/murder_in_the_woods	08aa19b2-8f9d-31ab-89e1-7869a6436950	5	Hot cast. Overall good times! Trejo in anything is always good!
/m/stuntwomen	4c9fdae2-fced-4fbd-a6af-79020656256a	0.5	Nah. need better perspectives. Not good enough.
/m/stuntwomen	4c9fdae2-fced-4fbd-a6af-79020656256a	4	Stuntwomen: The Untold Hollywood Story is a 2020 documentary taking a look at the history, struggles, and lives of some of the leading stuntwomen in the entertainment business.  The film is based on a book by Mollie Gregory.  It is an enlightening, behind the scenes look at some of the most interesting and exciting action movies and television projects of modern times; all from the vantage point of the female stunt performers.  The movie pays homage to some of the pioneers of stunts, including Jeannie Epper, Julie Ann Johnson, and Jadie David.  I found Amy Johnston‘s ‘sit-down" with Jeannie Epper to be one of the most compelling and moving aspects of the film.  Amy Johnston is someone to watch closely on both sides of the camera.  Taekwondo Life Magazine has been at the forefront of highlighting some of these talents; particularly, modern stunt artists with martial arts pedigrees.   Amy Johnston, Cheryl Lewis, and Thekla Hutyrova, prior guests, were all featured in the film.  Mindy Kelly, Lauren Mary Kim, and Gabriella Corvina, who have been featured in our forum, are also building great legacies in this genre but were, sadly, omitted.  When watching the film I couldn't help but think of my interview with legendary stuntman, Steven Lambert, where he recounted how he, reluctantly, was forced to stunt for female actresses.  This need came, not out of a lack of desire to have women perform these stunts, but from a lack of female performers to choose from.  From that perspective this documentary does highlight how far the industry has come in expanding the pool of gifted, daring, and talented women willing to risk their safety for the sake of popular entertainment.    This is an enjoyable and important film and I recommend it despite Shout Factory‘s ignoring our request for a screener's copy.
/m/stuntwomen	4c9fdae2-fced-4fbd-a6af-79020656256a	4	Great ride!  This documentary brings it all to the screen!  Brava ladies Brava!!
/m/resisterhood	3b12b4b3-d3bb-4544-a76d-5287a54b75f1	5	I've been an on again off again activist since coming of age in the late 60s and was devastated when HRC lost. This film authentically captures the mood of women of my generation moved to act as if muscle memory kicked in, as well as the awakening of a new generation, many of whom thought there was no need for women to fight.
/m/resisterhood	3b12b4b3-d3bb-4544-a76d-5287a54b75f1	5	Great and inspiring film! I recommend watching!
/m/resisterhood	3b12b4b3-d3bb-4544-a76d-5287a54b75f1	5	Resisterhood will make you cry at times from anger, joy and sometimes pure sweetness but it will leave you uplifted and inspired to get involved and make the world a better place. In this time when the constant drumbeat of lies, grifting and division often leaves us feeling powerless, this film will leave you feeling uplifted, engaged and empowered. Resisterhood is a story for our time and beautifully captures the newfound engagement of millions of women in the political process.
/m/resisterhood	3b12b4b3-d3bb-4544-a76d-5287a54b75f1	5	Resisterhood delivers a positive message of hope and empowerment that resonates in these difficult times. It is told through the stories of women called to action for the common good. They are your neighbors, your book club buddies, and they are you. Be inspired by their stories.
/m/resisterhood	3b12b4b3-d3bb-4544-a76d-5287a54b75f1	5	This is the story of five diverse characters and their fight for the rights to vote, equality and personal freedoms in a country that has swung to the right. The film weaves these stories into a tapestry that shows what drives them and what they do for others. One has a history linking them with the Selma March to Montgomery with MLK and John Lewis. One has an ancestor, who marched to the White House in 1913 as a suffragette and created a group protesting injustice. One was a House of Representative Congressman, who spoke against gun violence and kids in cages and was arrested for his values. One is a new citizen from Egypt, who ran and won for Rockville City council. One was a professional soccer player, who became the Rainbow Warrior and after her injury became an inspirational speaker. The whole project is very well done and a historical document showing what Democracy Looks Like!
/m/resisterhood	3b12b4b3-d3bb-4544-a76d-5287a54b75f1	5	Resisterhood created by brilliant filmmaker CJ Crim made me laugh and cry as it took me on a Powerful time travel journey of our nation as it rises up to reclaim its soul and move forward in unity. Not to be missed!!!!! Great Zoom party movie!!
/m/resisterhood	3b12b4b3-d3bb-4544-a76d-5287a54b75f1	5	It would seem that the country is about to be saved by women voting against the madness of this unhinged president.  The Resisterhood documentary tells this story, literally from Day One, in the very best tradition of American journalism.  The film is making a difference today by inspiring us to vote.  It will continue to make a difference, perhaps for generations, by having documented what happened and how women stood up and made their voices heard.
/m/lx_2048	6225f64f-e056-3da5-854e-9864ffcbb44b	3	If one enjoys dystopian cautionary tales then they shouldn't have much problem with this.  Could this ever happen to human civilization?  If everyone ‘does their part' then it eventually will.  It does seem to have a lot of similarities to other sci-fi films but the overall plot focus seems off a tad and there's a lot of mundane dialogue that's kinda hard to follow.  Not devoid of redeemable qualities though.
/m/lx_2048	6225f64f-e056-3da5-854e-9864ffcbb44b	1	Boring, Boring, Boring!  Sorry but I just could not get into the mood to watch this movie when so much else were out there to watch!!
/m/lx_2048	6225f64f-e056-3da5-854e-9864ffcbb44b	3.5	The ambiance is spot on, but often times it's difficult to tell if the bad acting is all part of the story, or if it really is that bad.
/m/lx_2048	6225f64f-e056-3da5-854e-9864ffcbb44b	4	This really should become a TV series. It would be like Westworld meets Black Mirror.  It took me a very long time juggling if I should see this with so many mixed reviews, but when I had nothing decent left to watch, I gave it a go, and I'm glad I did.  Yes, this film wont be for everyone. It's the opposite of an actual Hollywood sci-fi blockbuster, but it was still brilliant, and exceptionally produced, especially for a low budget B-film. It needed more time to expand on its many excellent elements, thus why this would make for an amazing and successful TV series, and would be right up there with Westworld and Black Mirror.  Shockingly, this stunning production was put together my a newb filmmaker, with this film being pretty much his 4th film, of 1 being a short. Writer, producer, editor and director Guy Moshe presented a film, that one would assume was put together by well know seasoned filmmakers.  Moshe's directing was flawless and his editing on point. The cinematography was outstanding, with amazing shots and use of colors and shadows. The sets and landscape were convincing of a futuristic world, and pretty much how I would envision it. The S/VFX were stunning. The score was fitting and on point - something rare for B-film, where it's typically loud, overbearingly constant, annoying and unfitting. The 103 min runtime, although a little slowly paced, still flowed nicely. But the faster pacing towards the end felt the story getting rushed and convoluted. I actually wanted another 10-20 mins added to the last quarter of the film, to elaborate more, and build up the story better. All casting and performances were excellent and convincing. If I would critique any performance, it'd be the cop, but then again, how different would attitudes, sympathy and compassion look like in the future?  Sure Moshe's screenplay wasn't perfect, but for a newb filmmaker, it was much better than some garbage I've seen lately from seasoned filmmakers. It had excellent storyline continuity and progression. But where Moshe shined, was in his brilliant story's premise, with his perfectly matched visuals. There are many components to his story, almost too many to fit in one movie, thus why this would be an excellent TV series. It questions our constantly changing environment and our own humanity, and what it means to be human, where cloning is a life-insurance option. It's about surviving and dealing with a changing dystopian world were we have to live at night due to the burning daytime sun. Where we live, work, play and communicate in a virtual world most of the time, and even "hang out" with friends and family in "the realm". Where office buildings are vacant due to this virtual and unbearable world. And so much more. What makes this really stand out, is that this story does not feel far fetched at all, especially when we're almost there.  This little gem will stay with you long after it's over. Never mind the "Hollywood-blockbuster expectation" reviewers, Moshe should be very proud of this accomplishment. If you're as hard core futuristic-sci-fi fan as I am, you will really appreciate and enjoy this one. And if you're like me, you will want more of it. So Mr. Moshe, please get to it sir. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me.
/m/lx_2048	6225f64f-e056-3da5-854e-9864ffcbb44b	5	A brilliant exploration of the what it means to be human now, then and in the future. Did not expect this kind of movie coming in, I was extremely surprised by this deep and thought provoking drama. Don't expect a de facto sci-fi movie the world depicted in the movie might as well be in 10 years from now and the ideas it tackles are things we are already dealing with weather we are aware of it or not. This is a timeless masterpiece and will be so till we stop being human.
/m/lx_2048	6225f64f-e056-3da5-854e-9864ffcbb44b	0.5	A slow paced movie that was poorly executed. No attempt was made to flesh out the story with compelling characters, drama or story line.  From the title and description, I expected much more.
/m/lx_2048	6225f64f-e056-3da5-854e-9864ffcbb44b	5	This movie surprised me in a very good way.
/m/lx_2048	6225f64f-e056-3da5-854e-9864ffcbb44b	2.5	The fine cast  grabs your attention.
/m/lx_2048	6225f64f-e056-3da5-854e-9864ffcbb44b	5	Great concept! Marvelous acting!
/m/lx_2048	6225f64f-e056-3da5-854e-9864ffcbb44b	5	Bravo! Super smart script and strong concept. The reason I love science fiction. Must see...
/m/mulan_2020	7e63963f-6cf7-4077-8577-3c2d92ee5e0b	1	Watch the cartoon instead.
/m/mulan_2020	7e63963f-6cf7-4077-8577-3c2d92ee5e0b	3	The film is about a kind and brave. Something was missing in the film, I didn't make it. The plot itself is not very interesting, but there is still something in it.
/m/mulan_2020	7e63963f-6cf7-4077-8577-3c2d92ee5e0b	1.5	Yeah, this is the way you never ever do a movie remake. And this is also the way you never ever do a movie about strong woman. The animated Mulan was great character. This one is just pain in the ass.
/m/mulan_2020	7e63963f-6cf7-4077-8577-3c2d92ee5e0b	5	Everything was Brilliant and of high calibre. From the story line; visuals and actors everything was GREAT. If you are looking for inspiration in your life, particularly if you have hardship finding your place in the world this movie is a must watch.
/m/mulan_2020	7e63963f-6cf7-4077-8577-3c2d92ee5e0b	3	Sadly the beautiful scenery and colours weren't enough to carry this off. Cannot compare to the original.
/m/mulan_2020	7e63963f-6cf7-4077-8577-3c2d92ee5e0b	0.5	Horrible acting and lack of story. There was no explanation of any of her powers and she can all of a sudden do crazy stunts without any training. Ok. And nobody could tell she was a girl. Ok
/m/mulan_2020	7e63963f-6cf7-4077-8577-3c2d92ee5e0b	0.5	Poor acting, and overall poor movie. Worst movie ever seen to date.
/m/mulan_2020	7e63963f-6cf7-4077-8577-3c2d92ee5e0b	2.5	One of the most disappointing live action remakes to come out of the mouse house  its too long oh and.... No Mushu! What were you thinking Disney? I have to admit the shape shifting witch character worked really well action was pretty impressive but still It felt so lifeless compared to the original
/m/mulan_2020	7e63963f-6cf7-4077-8577-3c2d92ee5e0b	0.5	Once again disney has shown us how terrible and incredibly pointless the live action remakes are, the character mulan who was once full of character, personality and lovable is now dumbed down to a plain canvas who is forgettable, the side characters are dumbed down to the point they leave no imprint. The villain is laughable and a pathetic excuse of a villain who is not scary in the slightest, the witch is painfully written and not needed, disney has failed to make a good live action adaptation and just show us that they are just interested in the Chinese audiences wallets.
/m/mulan_2020	7e63963f-6cf7-4077-8577-3c2d92ee5e0b	1	I think this is the Superman problem. When the protagonist is already perfect there is no grow of character and with that no depth for the story. In my opinion the acting (by orders of the director or maybe the actress interpretation), is extremely bland. P.S. seems to be, there were some problems in the production of this movie with some politics and human rights. Possibly some original fans disliked the movie before watching it.
/m/buoyancy	e3c5f17d-8c8d-31b3-8991-cba9e9b28f57	3.5	Well filmed and well acted.
/m/buoyancy	e3c5f17d-8c8d-31b3-8991-cba9e9b28f57	5	Superb. Shame on the Thais. Shame.
/m/buoyancy	e3c5f17d-8c8d-31b3-8991-cba9e9b28f57	4.5	Rodd Rathjen wrote and directed this Australian film on human trafficking in Thailand.  It's a foreign language feature with Khmer and Thai the two languages spoken.  First off, if you have any fears of swimming or deep water or drowning then I'd STRONGLY suggest skipping Buoyancy.  This tense and haunting thriller never lets you look away.  Rathjen's use of light to illustrate how confined spaces are make this movie come to life.  While the sound design wasn't my cup of tea it was a minor blemish in what is hopefully a long and brilliant career of Rathjen.  All of the actors are non-actors, but you wouldn't know it.  This is a really great film that will open your mind about a subject that not enough light is on.  Based on true stories, this is a film about survival.  With 30 minutes left you'll have no idea where it's going and you won't mind.   Final Score: 9/10
/m/buoyancy	e3c5f17d-8c8d-31b3-8991-cba9e9b28f57	3	With its heart decidedly in the right place, this socially conscious Australian offering shines an exceedingly bright light on the plight of Southeast Asian men and boys who are willfully deceived and ostensibly sold into slavery aboard Thai fishing boats, forced to work under deplorable conditions and sadistic sea captains. In what essentially turns out to be a Western on the high seas, viewers witness the brutal coming of age of a 14-year-old Cambodian youth who is looking for a better life but unwittingly takes a difficult path to reach his goal. In telling his story, the film features superb cinematography, an excellent score, capable performances and a sparklingly clear message, but its minimalist, sometimes-repetitive, often-predictable narrative and one-dimensional character development tend to undermine the other fine assets that the picture has going for it. While it's indeed discomforting to criticize a release with such noble intents behind it, it's also nevertheless regrettable that the filmmakers chose a comparatively pedestrian approach to fulfill them and to tell a story that's long overdue in being told.
/m/buoyancy	e3c5f17d-8c8d-31b3-8991-cba9e9b28f57	4	At one point, the 14-year-old Cambodian boy turned slave in a Thai fishermen ship, stares at the immensity of the ocean around him, contemplating a chance for freedom, a way to better survive his miserable condition. He might also regret leaving his home, with the excuse he wasn't getting paid for his father's requesting jobs ("why did you have so many children?" he courageously confronted his patriarch). He wouldn't have got trapped in a human trafficking, slavery operation taking place in the middle of the ocean, as an accurate portrait of what really occurs in these corrupt, lawless and impoverished parts of the world. His charismatic, determined personality attracts an allied from both sides: he becomes attached, and forms an unlikely father/son relationship with one of the slaved men among them, who shapes him through their suffering journey, and also captures admiration from one of the murderous captains in the ship, who decides to protect him and to turn him into one of his kind. Addressing children exploitation in a gripping atmosphere, powerfully performed and shockingly violent, Rodd Rathjen's feature debut is an impressive, cutting-edge survivalist tale.
/m/buoyancy	e3c5f17d-8c8d-31b3-8991-cba9e9b28f57	5	Really Loved this movie... took a day or two to really digest this masterpiece. Very gripping
/m/buoyancy	e3c5f17d-8c8d-31b3-8991-cba9e9b28f57	3.5	Not an easy film. But that is reality for you: not easy to watch and so many time overlooked.
/m/buoyancy	e3c5f17d-8c8d-31b3-8991-cba9e9b28f57	4	Overall, make no mistake, Buoyancy can be classed as a tough drama film to watch but I personally have no regrets in seeing it.  This film was a positive experience filled with solid performances and I would gladly recommend this film to many others.  8.1/10 - Walkden Entertainment
/m/the_garden_left_behind	62933bbe-913c-319d-baef-355625b97b64	3.5	While the film isn't revolutionary, it does plant a seed by allowing dozens of trans actors, and behind the scenes personal to make a movie.  That fact should make you smile.  We get Ed Asner for crying out loud.  One of the loudest progressive voices out there, Asner has done a lot of voice acting of late.  Seeing him here, even if the scenes are brief brings an energy and class to the picture.  Flavio Alves has written and directed four shorts, but this is his first feature length venture and it was funded in large part by EBAY.  Yes, you read that right.  Michael Madsen may have star billing, however he is in two scenes, probably filmed over a few hours.  Carlie Guevara is the star and while the story has heft, we have to talk about the elephant in the room.  Guevara is a novice at best and is often distracting.  I appreciate how trans characters are played by trans actors.  While there is still a long way to go, this film is a giant step forward from the ways trans characters were portrayed in the past.  All that said the final few scenes had a power thanks to Alves.  It's heartening to know films like this can be made.  Final score: 6.5/10
/m/the_garden_left_behind	62933bbe-913c-319d-baef-355625b97b64	1	One star because these are important stories and topics that need to be told. However, the script dialogue is horrendous. The acting atrocious. Riddled with lgbt cliché's: Main character not only struggles transitioning, but  also health problems, immigrant status, financial woes, AND a jerk boyfriend. I'm honestly surprised she didn't die of AIDs in the end. No that'd be too easy, let's bludgeon her in the streets.
/m/the_garden_left_behind	62933bbe-913c-319d-baef-355625b97b64	4.5	A perfect story about being human. It's urgent and important film.
/m/the_garden_left_behind	62933bbe-913c-319d-baef-355625b97b64	4	"Made to deliver timely message rather than perfection which is compelling and heartbreaking at some point" The movie successfully stressed out that the members of 'trans-gender community' deserves respect and freedom on society. The cast is good and often prove the worth of their role that fits to the emotional sense of the story.
/m/the_garden_left_behind	62933bbe-913c-319d-baef-355625b97b64	5	A film with true staying power. Alves and Rotondo deftly maintain a sense of suspense and trepidation for the protagonist that keeps you invested the entire time.  What a heartbreaking, but incredibly important, story to tell.
/m/the_garden_left_behind	62933bbe-913c-319d-baef-355625b97b64	5	An all around wonderful film! A must see especially with how the world is today.. with an outstanding cast and exceptional direction, this is the perfect mix of creativity and dedication! Flavio Alves will go down in history as one of the greatest directors of our time.
/m/the_garden_left_behind	62933bbe-913c-319d-baef-355625b97b64	0.5	Just another far Left movie from Hollywood :(
/m/the_garden_left_behind	62933bbe-913c-319d-baef-355625b97b64	5	As a psychologist and trans ally I went into this a little skeptical despite the glowing reviews and awards the film had already received, but it really is SO good! The script is fantastic, and they did such an excellent job with representation in casting and clearly did the work researching the community at the heart of the movie. The subject of the movie is so important to address in a world that's still ridiculously transphobic, with trans women of color in particular getting murdered at alarming rates. Recommending this to everyone!
/m/the_garden_left_behind	62933bbe-913c-319d-baef-355625b97b64	5	I enjoyed this film all the way through. It seemed like a very short 1 hour & 28 mins that captivated me all the way through with the drama involved. Tina's character played by Carla Guevera stole my heart from the beginning as a mexican undocumented young trans woman navigating modern life, trying to make ends meet while also trying to acquire gender affirming therapy & medication in New York City. This film does have a message of promoting acceptance of trans people but it is not overstated in the narrative. There is a realism & relevance used in the film in the way that cis people in close relations with Tina still do not perceive her fully as the gender she identifies as. This is articulated by the behavior of Tina's loving Grandmother & Tina's boyfriend Jason. The film includes other real trans people in supporting roles as Tina's supportive friends. The films focus also turns to Jason, a convenience store clerk who has served Tina in the store. He finds out she is trans from when Tina takes part in a trans justice campaign, which provides a meaningful backdrop to the main storyline. This leads to a final confrontation not unlike which is often reported in the real world, when men who are attracted to trans women become ashamed of themselves for having that attraction, which often leads to brutal consequences. There are some stand out scenes in this movie, particularly the launderette scene in which a large group of trans folk gather to organize an awareness campaign on the streets, the bar where the audience is first introduced to Michael Madsen's character as the bar owner, Tina's 2nd visit to the doctor (played by Bernadette Quigley) and the heart warming scene with the vocal therapist. This is a must see film for everyone not only for the poignant message of unfairness and cruelty that still persists towards trans women (especially black & latino trans women) & the need for tolerance and further promoting change to positive opinions towards trans folk in society. Its also just a very well made movie.
/m/the_garden_left_behind	62933bbe-913c-319d-baef-355625b97b64	5	A must see movie; especially with what has gone on in this country in the last few years.  What an incredibly moving film.  SO glad I saw it.  You should watch it today.
/m/children_of_the_sea_2020	96062ec9-cfb0-3a28-a668-7a16a9e4098f	2.5	A visual wonder but something of a narrative flop. Children of the Sea tries to cram a lot of content into a single film, and leaves too much unexplained.
/m/children_of_the_sea_2020	96062ec9-cfb0-3a28-a668-7a16a9e4098f	3.5	Fantastic, top of the line, hand drawn-C.G.I. hybrid animation, and a story that was so much bigger than I was expecting. I thought I was in for a little story about some kids swimming around with dolphins, and whales. What I got was something more thematically inline with "Tree of LIfe" or "2001 - A Space Odyssey".
/m/children_of_the_sea_2020	96062ec9-cfb0-3a28-a668-7a16a9e4098f	2	This movie feels like the result of giving a talented group of animators 2 sentences of plot and 4 million dollars.   Pros: Art was really nice. Never have I felt that the essence of an acid trip was captured so perfectly  Cons: When you're not tripping through the universe, there really isn't much sustenance for the rest of the movie.
/m/children_of_the_sea_2020	96062ec9-cfb0-3a28-a668-7a16a9e4098f	2	GhibliKids Studios presents another one of their anime entries  This uses a combination of 3D computer graphics and traditional stencil techniques  Ruka as a young girl saw something in the water at the aquarium her father works at  She swears it happened but no one believes her As summer vacation starts for her in high school Ruka meets a boy named Umi who was raised in the sea by dewgongs; he has the unique ability to swim and breathe underwater  His skin is also very sensitive to dryness Umi's brother Sora is in the hospital  Humans want to understand how these boys' biology works  But maybe the truth is humans can't know everything with any known tools at our disposal  The universe might be more than what we discover  The film itself is a visual splendor even if its story is less-than-comprehensible  It's also too freaking long and fails to tell a coherent plot  But for anime fans it'll please the senses  I was really checking out of this by the last half hour  It was lacking any substance or emotional resonance
/m/children_of_the_sea_2020	96062ec9-cfb0-3a28-a668-7a16a9e4098f	3	Gorgeous sea animation with a daring style, yet convoluted plot.  Ayumu Watanabe's fantasy mystery anime Children of the Sea (2019) is a very pretty movie with this stunning hybrid of lush hand drawn animation and crazy CGI backgrounds here and there. I'm not quite sure how Watanabe and his animators even made Children of the Sea because it looks beautiful, but strange. The vibrant blues for the ocean is truly gorgeous. I love all the sea creature designs and fluid movements. Children of the Sea looks groundbreaking to an extent, but I wanted more underwater animation and sea life. The whales and fish look better than any of the humans. Watanabe's direction is pretty outlandish with creative fantasy visuals and lovely animation. But I kept getting distracted by the incomprehensible narrative.  Furthermore, the general character designs are great, but some of the odd imagery doesn't quite move me like Daisuke Igarashi's writing wants to stun his audience. The story feels underwritten because all the characters come across as weird for the sake of being enigmatic, instead of realistic well rounded people. I couldn't really connect with any of the characters except for the heroine Ruka on a superficial level. Too many characters just spout exposition like water gushing out a whale's blowhole for no reason. Endless narration and exposition isn't as compelling as the neat animation throughout Children of the Sea.  Igarashi's story is strange like it wants to be Akira or 2001, but it's not intelligent or engaging. Children of the Sea is nice to look at, but hardly riveting storytelling. Children of the Sea is a curious mystery, you never quite understand, when it should have tried to lean more into the coming of age elements. I think most viewers will wonder what even happened during Children of the Sea.  Shinji Kimura's art direction is intriguing for all the water glowing and effervescent swimming sequences. All the strange lights against the sea blues look amazing. Ken'ichi Konishi's visual effects are cool for the fish floating around and the translucent glow of certain mystical objects. I think all the lighting looks spectacular. Children of the Sea should have had more Summer vibes and relaxation, instead of dragging on through incoherent rambling fantasy plots.  Joe Hisaishi's score is lovely as usual from the iconic Japanese composer. His serent piano melodies and soaring symphonic compositions are resplendent. Hisaishi's music elevates Children of the Sea to another level. All the voice acting is pretty neat, if a little stilted. I thought the English Dub was alright, although Children of the Sea is probably better in Japanese.  In all, Children of the Sea is not the most incredible anime feature, but it is a pretty one for sure.

/m/children_of_the_sea_2020	96062ec9-cfb0-3a28-a668-7a16a9e4098f	3.5	"Kaijû no kodomo" o en español "Espíritus del mar" es una película de animación japonesa de 2019, dirigida por Ayumu Watanabe y basada en el manga creado por Daisuke Igarashi.  La cinta narra la historia de Luka, una joven adolecente que, en sus vacaciones de verano, encuentra dentro del acuario donde trabaja su padre, a Umy y Sora; dos chicos misteriosos que fueron criados por manatíes en el mar, por lo que desarrollaron maravillosas habilidades nadando y conviviendo con especies del océano.  Tras el contacto con ellos, Luka se da cuenta que tiene cierta conexión especial con el mar al igual que estos, por lo que poco a poco se adentran en una gran aventura fantástica para descubrir los misterios que ocultan los chicos y una serie de eventos que ocurren en el océano. Un filme que al principio plantea ser otra historia de una adolecente normal e incomprendida por el mundo, pero que, conforme pasan los minutos se vuelve algo más complejo y onírico. Desarrollando un conflicto que se da entre la timidez inherente de Luka y el enorme alcance del descubrimiento que le espera. Desde los primeros minutos "Espíritus del mar" se destaca por su espectacular animación y por secuencias de ensueño que causan un gran impacto visual. Y, a pesar que el filme cuenta con un estilo de dibujo muy tradicional del anime, en lo relacionado a los personajes con grandes ojos que retratan ternura, es un trabajo detallado en la creación de las anatomías de los cuerpos y resto de objetos, haciendo que estos se vean muy realistas. Además, la animación también presenta el uso de figuras bastante abstractas similares a los mangas, que logran combinarse bastante bien con los colores, las luces y sombras, con una destreza envidiable por cualquier otra película del género. Esto, sumado a una banda sonora compuesta por Joe Hisaishi conocido por participar en filmes como El Viaje de Chihiro (2001), El Castillo Vagabundo (2004), Mi Vecino Totoro (1988), entre otros. Una musicalización que se constituye también con gran parte de sonidos del mar como, por ejemplo, los cantos de las ballenas, que logran que la experiencia cinematográfica se vuelva algo fantástico visual y auditivamente. Sin embargo, a pesar de tener una animación envidiable, la trama falla en diversas ocasiones, generando dudas al espectador, ya que nunca queda todo claro. Esto se da debido a algunas sub tramas, que no aportan nada valioso a la historia principal, que más bien confunden y le restan a la construcción narrativa. Por lo que si no se presta la atención adecuada a los hechos que suceden en la pantalla, es fácil perder la tensión al momento de llegar a la resolución del conflicto que no se resuelve gracias al desarrollo argumental, sino que es gracias a la ayuda visual que se genera con las animaciones. Una película que propone un mensaje final sobre cómo los humanos desconocemos de donde vienen las maravillas de la vida y hacia dónde vamos en un mundo del cual no sabemos nada. Por lo que cada personaje dentro de la historia busca o se plantea la manera de explicar la vida desde su punto de vista.  Por ejemplo, Sora dice "Yo creo que el universo se parece a los humanos. Dentro de los humanos muchos pequeños recuerdos de historias se están desmoronando, y algunos recuerdos se conectan entre sí. Varios recuerdos se sientes atraídos por un recuerdo más grande, y crecen. Me parece que eso se parece a pensar y sentir ¿no?" Una historia que es narrada de forma lineal, pero que presenta una particularidad en su final mostrando una escena post créditos con la que se logra cerrar el hilo de argumentos que quedan suelto.  Y, si bien, los japoneses tienen películas de narraciones de dramas fantásticos, con desarrollos diferentes a las películas occidentales, es importante que estos se plasmen adecuadamente, o sino, corren el riesgo que las ideas no se comprendan de todo bien.  "Espíritus del mar" es una cinta compleja que abarca una premisa difícil de plasmar en argumentos pero que por ello es auxiliada muy bien por sus imágenes y secuencias que hacen que te atraigas por ellas y comiences a pesar sobre el mensaje final que busca retratar.
/m/children_of_the_sea_2020	96062ec9-cfb0-3a28-a668-7a16a9e4098f	2	Its normally not that hard for me to get into most anime movies especially if its visually pleasing. Children of the sea was very beautiful but the story was much to slow and it didn't even end up being worth the wait. I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone.
/m/children_of_the_sea_2020	96062ec9-cfb0-3a28-a668-7a16a9e4098f	4	The story is indeed far from satisfactory, however, the artful sense definitely worth a watch, like the most brilliant dream I ever had.
/m/children_of_the_sea_2020	96062ec9-cfb0-3a28-a668-7a16a9e4098f	3.5	Studio Ghibli was well known for "feels like a dream" fantasy anime, but they haven`t done that style in a while. So it felt really good to see a new full length animation-film with that style and this is what Japan do best i think. A real visual fiest for the eye. But this is not Studio Ghibli story- telling at it`s best though. And some of the ideas is obviously "borrowed" from Ponyo. Actually, this is not Ghibli at all. It`s called Studio 4C°. They also released "Birdboy" (a spanish animation gem) and the hyper violent mindblowing "Mutafukaz". A little taste of their diversity.   Some of this film feels like a trippy music video and other parts feels like a highschool drama with marine elements...It`s all over the place. But if you want a visual overdose of spectacular beauty and impressive animation techniques, fasten your seatbelt.

/m/measure_for_measure_2020	f079807e-080c-3f5a-880d-7ac1e1a82165	5	Strong performances deliver a strong story that is a relative updating of Shakespeare's masterpiece. This is worth a look. Loved it!
/m/measure_for_measure_2020	f079807e-080c-3f5a-880d-7ac1e1a82165	0.5	An awkward Australian independent film that hides behind an ambiguous trailer, while providing alluring promises of grandeur through its heavy reliance on Shakespeare and Hugo Weaving. Set against a daytime soap Melbourne backdrop, with minimal performances by said Hugo, contrary to trailer promises, the film is an excellent exercise in cringeworthiness, exacerbated by nameless local acts who fail to match Hugo's presense, and a color palette/ shot sequence taken right out of daytime television. Think Elrond meets Home and Away. Despite it's lackluster performance, local Victorians are sure to laude this 5th place runner for years to come simply for its proximity to home.
/m/i_am_woman	a6689b05-12da-38a4-ae72-f8ed0c939f7d	3.5	I enjoyed this one and thought it was a good look into the woman and musician that Helen Reddy became during the late 60's & 70's era. I was a good flashback as I remember her being one of my mother's favorite singers.
/m/i_am_woman	a6689b05-12da-38a4-ae72-f8ed0c939f7d	5	The singing style reminded me of the time so ... 70's Good.  You recall Karen Carpenter and others of the era.  It's the placement of words and phrasing, the phrases since in tributes make the song less laid back.  Like Dusty Springfield  and Aretha Franklin's versions of 'son of a preacher man', today's makes "I am Woman" from a 70s recording of that time to the attitude of the today its "woman hear me roar! " And the original is a good amazing recording, and I will listen to current versions differently. Tilda did an amazing job, the costumes rock and I wonder where to shop for those clothes.   The dynamic between the business partner and the male role as manager to the superstar, seeing the man supporting her and uncomfortable with suggested male female roles. The feminist and the judgement of one compared to money and the effort of one mans effort in a woman's success they tried to ... His part in her and hers his story.  Sad they those who judged didn't realize they had their own cheerleaders at home themselves and there was an equality that societally different but only from the lense you look through.    We have come a long way.  And these movies are an important part of the american & world wide women's path.  The steps up.  The growth that one woman's voice became two and then a roar.  On the lawn in D.C. in a women's march, I'd love be to see a documentary on.  We've done so much as have our men.  Men who made it possible for women make the record, who published the book, who stood up for an artist.
/m/i_am_woman	a6689b05-12da-38a4-ae72-f8ed0c939f7d	3.5	Trying to cram Helen Reddy's career into one biopic is understandably a huge challenge. "I Am Woman" is a worthy film but for those who know more of the story of Helen Reddy this biopic missed a lot. However, it remains an entertaining film none the less.
/m/i_am_woman	a6689b05-12da-38a4-ae72-f8ed0c939f7d	3	Before this movie I had never heard of Helen Reddy - but it seems she had a pretty good run of things back in the 60s/70s.  I had never heard of the anthem that she sang for the women's lib movement.  The movie shows some of her struggles as a woman and single mom, but doesn't elicit much emotion dramatically or musically.
/m/i_am_woman	a6689b05-12da-38a4-ae72-f8ed0c939f7d	2	My interests in this film were piqued only after Mark Kermode named it one of his 10 Worst in 2020. Granted, I can't argue that this biopic isn't terribly conventional and wouldn't look out of place as a Lifetime Movie of the week, but I'd consider it only marginally worse than, and play about as safe as, the Oscar-winning Bohemian Rhapsody, which frankly irritated me more. Charting the rise and fall of Helen Reddy, the Australian songstress/activist, from the late 60s as a determined single mother in NYC struggling to make ends meet, to her rise to fame in the 70s after meeting her future husband/manager Jeff Wald, and then the inevitable decline in the 80s, both financially, as a result of Wald's excesses, and commercially, as she falls out of favour; every narrative beat and turn here are heavily signposted and soaked in familiarity. It's bad enough that her story appears to be entirely made up of rock-and-roll cliches, but screenwriter Emma Jensen's superficial and unsophisticated treatment just made things worse. Tilda Cobham-Hervey's performance as the wholesome Reddy is admirable but dull, while the entire cast is lumbered with delivering Jensen's clunky and hokey dialogue. Yet, I don't think better dialogue could've saved Evan Peters' hammy portrayal of Wald. Call it nostalgia peddling if you must, but where the film works is reminding us of her songs and the significance they had if only for a moment in time. On the other hand, for a film set during the Women's Liberation movement that sees its central female character fights and prospers within a patriarchal industry and writes an anthem for that movement, it's ironic that it's the sisterhood between two working women: Reddy and her journalist bestie Lillian Roxon, that the film ultimately fails to do proper justice to.
/m/i_am_woman	a6689b05-12da-38a4-ae72-f8ed0c939f7d	3	It's not perfect but thoroughly entertaining and well told
/m/i_am_woman	a6689b05-12da-38a4-ae72-f8ed0c939f7d	4	Enjoyed, the actress portraying Helen Reddy did a Great job!  The casting and directing seemed right on.  Well done!
/m/i_am_woman	a6689b05-12da-38a4-ae72-f8ed0c939f7d	4	I'm a fairly knowledgable film person, and I'm old enough to remember the effect "I Am Woman" had on 12-year-old me. Is it a perfect film? No. But I think the 66% fresh rating is too low. I'm wary of such ratings when the fans give a movie 8, 9, or 10% points more than the critics. Could it be that critics can be a little too jaded to just WATCH a film and go along for the ride? I found the final scene inspiring! So sue me!
/m/i_am_woman	a6689b05-12da-38a4-ae72-f8ed0c939f7d	4	A wonderful yet heartwrenching story mixed with a powerful soundtrack. This film is one of clear passion and storytelling. Definitely worth watching. The soundtrack will live in my playlists for eternity.

/m/nail_in_the_coffin_the_fall_and_rise_of_vampiro	c546b87b-91ca-3267-9d29-a27fbb86092e	5	I was living in México City when the man featured in the documentary was at the height of his fame, not only as a wrestler but also as a nightlife fixture and a mainstream celebrity. It now seems odd that he might not have been as well-known internationally, but this was in the pre-internet days. I only recently became aware of this documentary, which is unquestionably violent (I averted my eyes more than once), but also tremendously touching and strangely relatable for anyone who makes sacrifices in order to be a the best parent possible. The rock and roll/punk rock vibe in the wrestling scenes is a stark contrast to other scenes featuring a sleepy Canadian town, and this adds to the documentary's appeal.
/m/nail_in_the_coffin_the_fall_and_rise_of_vampiro	c546b87b-91ca-3267-9d29-a27fbb86092e	5	This is a great documentary! Well worth watching!
/m/nail_in_the_coffin_the_fall_and_rise_of_vampiro	c546b87b-91ca-3267-9d29-a27fbb86092e	5	If youve ever been a fan of wrestling. Watch this movie. It sheds so much light on not just his career but the bts things we never see. Quite a few tear jerker moments too
/m/nail_in_the_coffin_the_fall_and_rise_of_vampiro	c546b87b-91ca-3267-9d29-a27fbb86092e	2.5	Wandering and as unfocused as the protagonist, Nail in the Coffin: The Fall and Rise of Vampiro is too cumbersome.  I had high hopes for this growing up a wrestling fan, but it's all over the place.  There were a couple obstacles for the fall of Vampiro, but it didn't seem too big a deal.  They weren't major obstacles.  Usually they would be talked up, not played down.  If you did a profile of every wrestler in their 50s this is what you get.  The problem is Vampiro, AKA Ian Hodgkinson, who also served as an executive producer, has an amazing backstory.  He's a Canadian who made millions wrestling in Mexico with no wrestling experience.  Think about that.  It seems like the documentarian spent a few days with the subject, but didn't think that the different looks of Vampiro might confuse people.  Sometimes he had longer hair and looked much younger.  Other times he had short hair.  Maybe it could have been explained.  Maybe they were shot years apart.  Either way this one needs another pass and it's a shame.  Final Score: 5/10
/m/nail_in_the_coffin_the_fall_and_rise_of_vampiro	c546b87b-91ca-3267-9d29-a27fbb86092e	4	I happened to see this was on Prime over New Year's weekend and what a nice surprise this turned out to be. I had long forgotten about Vampiro (Ian) as I personally haven't been into wrestling since the late 90's & the days of the Monday Night Wars. Here's a really good guy who has done so much at a young age, stopped the bad habits early, is focused on being a great father, etc... and concurrently has become so jaded at the life he chose and the choices he still makes. There's no miraculous recovery from broken bones and 25 concussions so I really hope he can just focus on his daughter, just the business and being happy.
/m/nail_in_the_coffin_the_fall_and_rise_of_vampiro	c546b87b-91ca-3267-9d29-a27fbb86092e	5	A must watch for any wrestling fan. The documentary does a great job at documenting the situation Vampiro found himself in a few years ago with trying to provide and be a single father to a teenager while working in an industry he has grown to hate while having failing health.
/m/bloody_nose_empty_pockets	53b98a53-f9af-43bf-922d-c54715ec7eaa	5	It doesn't give you anything for free, but draws you in and rewards paying attention to the subtleties of the interactions. For me it was a brilliant commentary on 'change' and a perfect film.

This movie is a sad depiction of what many do or actually don't do, with their lives.  As they pontificate about the generational stereotypes, their philosophical beliefs fall flat.  What is heart-breaking is that this bar and these regulars have valid meaning to many of their lives, and yet, none of them have genuine care or concern for the other.  Although they spend so much time together, nobody really knows the other.  It is a great example of what NOT to do with your life.

/m/feels_good_man	55af7c7b-e3ed-4194-851a-a9a235be3cbe	4	A very tough film to locate, but well worth it, 'Feels Good Man' details the origin of the internet meme Pepe the Frog mostly through the eyes of its creator, Matt Furie.  Arthur Jones has put together a very detailed debut documentary covered just about every aspect of Pepe and Matt and the shifts in both.  The quest is to turn Pepe back into the character he was intended to be and not a symbol of hate.  Speaking of hate the Anti-Defamation League doesn't come across as tolerant, accepting, or willing to change.  The more you know!  If you have a library card check this out on Kanopy.

This really is a fantastic movie. Way better than I imagined. If anyone wants to understand meme culture in the future this movie should be the first thing people view. Easily a 5 star documentary. It was oddly emotional too. More emotional than you would imagine a documentary about a internet meme would be. It really does have you cheering for the original creator. Pepe is now a world wide symbol meaning almost anything you could imagine. A symbol for everyone from white nationalists, anti-fascists, free loving individuals, to Hong Kong pro democracy protestors. Amazing documentary. This was also self released so please buy it if you can. Good stuff.

Ya infiltrado, le cuesta asumir su rol de topo y se transforma en uno más al interior de la casa de reposo. Un documental inusual pero enternecedor y compasivo que nos recuerda la terrible soledad que deben soportar los adultos mayores cuando sus familiares se olvidan de ellos tan pronto son internados. Llena de momentos divertidos y momentos algo tristes, se puede definir con una palabra: humana.
/m/the_mole_agent	85548512-f687-48b9-908c-dbe1fae96724	4	Fácil, directo, bien hecho, una pequeña triquiñuela para recordar una gran verdad. Algunos ya pasamos por ahí, algunos podemos ver nuestros errores ahí, algunos "sentimos" por lo que se muestra ahí, algunos experimentamos mucha melancolía...
/m/the_mole_agent	85548512-f687-48b9-908c-dbe1fae96724	4	What started off seeming as just a funny spy documentary became much more deeper and emotional by the end.
/m/the_mole_agent	85548512-f687-48b9-908c-dbe1fae96724	4	Good-hearted and charming with a powerful message and reminder of true love and familial duty
/m/the_mole_agent	85548512-f687-48b9-908c-dbe1fae96724	0.5	For a documentary, it's staged and it doesn't show the actual reality. It's acted and staged, clearly not reflecting what actually happens on the elder houses
/m/the_mole_agent	85548512-f687-48b9-908c-dbe1fae96724	3	This Oscar nominated documentary has an 83-year old man going "undercover" at a nursing home... though that aspect gets dropped fairly early on and it becomes a rather touching look at life inside the home.
/m/the_mole_agent	85548512-f687-48b9-908c-dbe1fae96724	5	Not at all what I expected. heartwarming, heartbreaking, and wholly relatable if you have older family members. and we all do or will.
/m/the_mole_agent	85548512-f687-48b9-908c-dbe1fae96724	3	When the daughter of a nursing home patient suspects that her mother is being subjected to elder abuse and theft of her possessions, she hires an investigator to verify the claims through surveillance conducted by an elderly "spy" he recruits to check in as a temporary resident. What the mole finds, however, doesn't exactly jibe with the accusations but, instead, reveals a very different truth about what it's like to be a resident of one of these facilities. Despite this, though, director Maite Alberdi's latest documentary offering struggles with telling its story, leading viewers to believe it's headed in one direction while actually moving in another less-than-apparent manner, one that's not well delineated until the film's closing moments. What's more, it's not always clear just how much of a "documentary" this release really is, given a premise that seems to be more than a little "planned" in nature. Also, its attempts at humor, though cute at first, fade as the picture progresses and reveals a more substantive, serious narrative, one that makes its comedic material look cheeky as a consequence. There indeed is an important message here, but its presentation deserved better treatment in the finished product.
/m/the_mole_agent	85548512-f687-48b9-908c-dbe1fae96724	5	Fantastic Movie, so touching!
/m/critical_thinking	85203a76-c4e1-44fb-a007-fb491a038ba2	4.5	Picture yourself in 1998: Inner-city Miami youth's only hope of escaping crime, violence and gangs is a chess club taught by Mr. J.L. Martinez  (John Leguizamo). This is based on real life events. John Leguizamo  directed this gem and it has scores of producers which says a lot for the integrity of the film. The story is gritty and real and the cast is excellently balanced. This is a real winner to all involved -- including the audience!
/m/critical_thinking	85203a76-c4e1-44fb-a007-fb491a038ba2	2.5	The tropes of this kind of film are fully employed here keeping this from being as intense or emotional as it should be. Which is a shame because John Leguizamo is so natural in his role.
/m/critical_thinking	85203a76-c4e1-44fb-a007-fb491a038ba2	5	This is a fantastic movie about a group of minority high school students who compete at chess, not football or soccer. It is a fantastic view into life in the poverty ridden inner city and their drive to succeed. A fantastic movie. You must see this
/m/critical_thinking	85203a76-c4e1-44fb-a007-fb491a038ba2	2.5	Chess movies always go way over my head . And it was a tad cheesy if I’m being honest . And predictable . I can see why some people would like tho 2.3
/m/critical_thinking	85203a76-c4e1-44fb-a007-fb491a038ba2	4.5	Really well made movie. Enjoyed it a lot.
/m/critical_thinking	85203a76-c4e1-44fb-a007-fb491a038ba2	0.5	Virtue signaling at it's best. Such a bad movie.  This guy is crying opression yet makes millions, such a joke.
/m/critical_thinking	85203a76-c4e1-44fb-a007-fb491a038ba2	5	LOVED this movie. Such a feel good movie!
/m/critical_thinking	85203a76-c4e1-44fb-a007-fb491a038ba2	1	Dull. Lacked leadership.
/m/critical_thinking	85203a76-c4e1-44fb-a007-fb491a038ba2	4	Is a good movie... Lack of resources from school a teacher manage to sent a talented school boy fight for the national champion... 1 of them is a kids who doesn't go to school but his brain is geniuses an won individual national tournament against 3 time former chess champion
/m/critical_thinking	85203a76-c4e1-44fb-a007-fb491a038ba2	5	This is the best movie about chess I have seen and I love the diversity of the characters and the actors.  My husband and son love chess so they were glued.  I know absolutely nothing about chess and I was glued as well. Kudos to everyone bringing this true story to life and To John Leguizamo for his love and passion for this film.  It truly shows in every scene.  MIAMI!
/m/followed	d40eeffe-bfe8-4b6e-a37f-1d586b8c2ac2	3.5	Really solid scary movie . Had to turn the lights on
/m/followed	d40eeffe-bfe8-4b6e-a37f-1d586b8c2ac2	3	was better than I thought would be, ending was garbage though
/m/followed	d40eeffe-bfe8-4b6e-a37f-1d586b8c2ac2	1	Acting was terrible the plot was even worse
/m/followed	d40eeffe-bfe8-4b6e-a37f-1d586b8c2ac2	2.5	Just a cleaner looking cliche found-footage horror film. 5.2/10, C
/m/followed	d40eeffe-bfe8-4b6e-a37f-1d586b8c2ac2	2.5	i actually don't think it's THAT bad... it's just SO cheesy. both the dialog & the acting. i wouldn't recommend, but if you like mediocre B-movies you might enjoy it.
/m/followed	d40eeffe-bfe8-4b6e-a37f-1d586b8c2ac2	4	Starts out seeming a bit cheesy and corny, but finishes so strong. Maybe some would say the plot twist was expected, but I didn't see it coming. I'm an avid horror movie watcher and fan. Horror isn't the same as it used to be. This was a refreshing piece of hope for found footage type of horror film. I also greatly appreciate seeing new faces in the cast. I personally say it's worth the watch. There's so much to unpack tied into real events and mysteries. It's so hard to find a good horror movie in the recent years, this was definitely one of the better ones.
/m/followed	d40eeffe-bfe8-4b6e-a37f-1d586b8c2ac2	0.5	The lead is possibly the worst actor I've seen in a long time, made worse by the fact that the character is instantly dislikable (I want him to suffer from the word go). The supporting cast are poor, plot is thin, movie is full of cliches and there is absolutely nothing original about it at all... oh and it's not scary so it completely defeats the object 0.1/10
/m/followed	d40eeffe-bfe8-4b6e-a37f-1d586b8c2ac2	3.5	Great premise and a creepy set up, but mediocre acting and rudderless direction took away from the scares. If you like this genre it's overall worth a watch.
/m/followed	d40eeffe-bfe8-4b6e-a37f-1d586b8c2ac2	2	Okay as far as the low bar set by found footage movies goes, but nothing particularly special. The ending is rubbish too.
/m/followed	d40eeffe-bfe8-4b6e-a37f-1d586b8c2ac2	5	Followed is a terrifying, thought provoking journey through a real-life inspired hotel from hell and influencer culture!
/m/the_surrogate_2020	10c13edd-c188-4351-b3a5-db50481311cb	4	Give me more Jasmine Batchelor please and in a hurry.  In her feature film debut she knocks it out of the park in a very nuanced character study.  Batchelor plays the best friend of Josh (Chris Perfetti) who along with his husband ask her to be a surrogate and from there we have a film that should leave you thinking or even better talking.  Jeremy Hersh, who wrote and directed just his second feature film has been able to capture moments that are real.  While there isn't a lot on the page, and there certainly is a lot a time with zero dialogue, it's necessary as we digest the complications that arise.  This is why we watch movies! Final Score: 8/10
/m/the_surrogate_2020	10c13edd-c188-4351-b3a5-db50481311cb	5	Outstanding performances.   A thoughtful exploration of a very modern problem -- thankfully not a "downer", not preachy --- just a thoughtful examination of a dilemma.
/m/the_surrogate_2020	10c13edd-c188-4351-b3a5-db50481311cb	2.5	I thought it was as an ok movie. The ending was disappointing... all that fight For the baby to be born only to still get an abortion... makes me think what was the point of fighting all that time.... I understand people are allowed to change their mind... just was disappointing... I was rooting for her and little baby...
/m/the_surrogate_2020	10c13edd-c188-4351-b3a5-db50481311cb	4	SPOILER ALERT for those who have not watched yet— Very well acted for a most common circumstance. I found myself rooting for the main character throughout the movie as she searched all avenues for a humane solution to her predicament. I respected that she also embraced searching her soul, her morals and even a bit of faith in what would be the best decision. I know ‘happy endings’ are not always reality, but up until the very end I really hoped she had stayed on her original path...., and then, POOF, she changes her mind for the selfish reason of not wanting to be connected to the father of the baby. Suck it up, woman!! For THAT crap reason you end a life..... NOT because you’d be a single mom? Or it would be a financial burden on you? Or your career would be possibly jeopardized? Or what was the biggest issue throughout the whole movie, being the fetus tested positive for Down syndrome? She painstakingly got past ALL of this and more, yet when she realized she could in no way be connected to her two gay male ex- friends through her child, she just throws in the towel. So quick was this very sad and disappointing decision ( hence why only 4 stars) that I actually felt sick to my stomach. Shameful the disregard for human life, in any form.....and why was adoption all of a sudden taken off the table? Made no sense, after trying to prove this child had as much right as any to have a life. I guess bitterness and selfishness overrule all.
/m/the_surrogate_2020	10c13edd-c188-4351-b3a5-db50481311cb	0.5	This film failed the Down Syndrome community.  At first they did a very good job representing the community and giving information and facts that really seem to validate their lives.  I was very proud at the representation and the fight that Sarah had and the drive and passion that she pursued information and exposure with.  As a mother who went through this exact same journey not as a surrogate but as a mother learning that her baby was going to have Down syndrome you did all the right things in advocating that these lives absolutely matter.  But since she killed the baby in the end it was all for nothing and you might as well have left the Down Syndrome plotline out of this whole movie.  Basically everything that everyone else was saying negatively one out and anything you tried to do to bring positive attention to individuals born with Down Syndrome was no and void and I am passing this around the Down Syndrome community because we work very hard to make sure people understand that their lives are worthy and to have just some movie squash it like that is highly disappointing. The movie had a real chance and Sarah was my hero until the end. Shame on you for playing into the narrative that individuals with Down Syndrome are too much trouble.
/m/the_surrogate_2020	10c13edd-c188-4351-b3a5-db50481311cb	4	Smartly written and well acted, this is one of the better LGBTQ indie films out there, but focusing, rightly so, on the Surrogate. Find it somewhere.
/m/the_surrogate_2020	10c13edd-c188-4351-b3a5-db50481311cb	0.5	Literally one of the top 10 worst movies I have seen ! Can't believe I lasted until that ending (which was terrible).
/m/rent_a_pal	e5323d87-6824-3606-aa72-4a532e088562	5	Best 2020 movie ! Ce film est un chef d'œuvre. Réalisation et photo magistrales, interprétations brillantes, scénario génial, musique parfaite. Ce film évite toute facilité avec brio et joue constamment avec l'émotion du spectateur. C'est tellement touchant, terrifiant, intelligent. Mais tellement bravo pour ce 1er film !
/m/rent_a_pal	e5323d87-6824-3606-aa72-4a532e088562	5	Disturbing, fun, and amazing!
/m/rent_a_pal	e5323d87-6824-3606-aa72-4a532e088562	4.5	A very unique horror movie that starts off very slow but gradually gains traction and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll. I gave this 4.5 stars instead of 5 because the ending *should* have gone in a different direction based upon some subtle foreshadowing in dialogue and "hidden" messages/objects in a few shots. Still, a good ending. This will likely become one of those cult classics that people talk about for decades
/m/rent_a_pal	e5323d87-6824-3606-aa72-4a532e088562	2.5	This movie is very sad. You should know what you're getting yourself into
/m/rent_a_pal	e5323d87-6824-3606-aa72-4a532e088562	0.5	Quite boring and a little creepy in a weird way, not scary way. Definitely didn't need to see a nude old lady for randomness. The main character had a sad life in a rather pathetic way that was easily solvable. In the end, it was sort of unexplained craziness, and that was about the only excitement of the film.
/m/rent_a_pal	e5323d87-6824-3606-aa72-4a532e088562	4	you really didn't know where it was going. great characters. the dvd has lots of worthwhile extras.
/m/rent_a_pal	e5323d87-6824-3606-aa72-4a532e088562	3.5	Creepy with a good story.
/m/rent_a_pal	e5323d87-6824-3606-aa72-4a532e088562	0.5	It literally sucked. probably the worst movie ever created. No plot, no thrill, just the dumbest movie. you couldn't pay me too watch it again
/m/rent_a_pal	e5323d87-6824-3606-aa72-4a532e088562	0.5	Worlds worse movie ,no plot , was a waste of my time , and the most pointless scenes and unnecessary. -100/10
/m/rent_a_pal	e5323d87-6824-3606-aa72-4a532e088562	3	Esta cinta es jodidamente depresiva, y aunque su realizacion no es nada sorprendente, Brian Landis Folkins hace un excelente trabajo cargando toda la trama a sus espadas.
/m/the_argument	a6eb0d8e-fcd6-3b3f-ab98-825de69962c2	2.5	A cheap redo of the Movie "Carnage" produced in 2011.  This has been re-hashed into a new film titled "The Argument".  But having watch Carnage starring Jodie Foster (The Silence of the Lambs fame) I found this movie mediocre at best!
/m/the_argument	a6eb0d8e-fcd6-3b3f-ab98-825de69962c2	4.5	Robert expertly steered the wit of Stanford's script throughout the first act set up, and truly let his style shine with the upbeat montage that captured Jack and Lisa's bizarre descent into madness with such delight as well as the should-stop-but-can't participation of their peers with brilliance. Pairing that with Robert's comical and informed takes on people from all walks of the entertainment industry makes for an absolute joy of a film!
/m/the_argument	a6eb0d8e-fcd6-3b3f-ab98-825de69962c2	3.5	A fun film to check out with some friends at your next socially distanced dinner party!
/m/the_argument	a6eb0d8e-fcd6-3b3f-ab98-825de69962c2	5	Such a smart funny and contemporary re-interpretation of Roshoman. Particularly relevant today. Schwartzman has assembled a talented funny cast, and he's directed them with a light and confident hand. LOVED IT!!!!
/m/the_argument	a6eb0d8e-fcd6-3b3f-ab98-825de69962c2	5	LAUGHED OUR ASSES OFF!! Q IS INCREDIBLE IN THIS MOVIE
/m/the_argument	a6eb0d8e-fcd6-3b3f-ab98-825de69962c2	5	Love it! Must see, great concept, acting, and all around classic feeling
/m/the_argument	a6eb0d8e-fcd6-3b3f-ab98-825de69962c2	5	Tyler James Williams was a stud in this film. I enjoyed the part when he took his shirt off, though.
/m/the_argument	a6eb0d8e-fcd6-3b3f-ab98-825de69962c2	5	Tyler James Williams is a stud in this film!!! When he took his shirt off, my heart melted.
/m/the_argument	a6eb0d8e-fcd6-3b3f-ab98-825de69962c2	3	Original with solid acting . That will always get at least a 3 star from me even if it wasn’t that funny . 3.1. Coulda used the same premise and been much better if the argument itself wasn’t so trivial
/m/the_argument	a6eb0d8e-fcd6-3b3f-ab98-825de69962c2	1.5	Its very hard to find a reason to sit though 80 minutes of nonsenses happening on screening that isn´t either funny, compelling or even really written well. The Argument might try to disguise itself as a satire of relationships, Hollywood or auditions (?), i just know having a bad timing getting though it all.
/m/up_on_the_glass	4e7b7df4-f2b1-3a08-bd3c-f38795b6c985	5	This movie was intriguing from the beginning! I found Jack, the main character, very relatable as he, as an "outsider", struggled with the conflict that ensued as his fantasy life faced off with reality.
/m/up_on_the_glass	4e7b7df4-f2b1-3a08-bd3c-f38795b6c985	5	Ignore the other reviews, this film is original, thought-provoking, and touching. If you want to see something truly moving, watch this film.
/m/up_on_the_glass	4e7b7df4-f2b1-3a08-bd3c-f38795b6c985	5	In his bold feature directorial debut, Del Principe skillfully crafts an understated thriller that combines vivid characters with a rich, dynamic setting. You'll undoubtedly appreciate the attention to detail and the intentionality that he's put into the project. Well done!
/m/up_on_the_glass	4e7b7df4-f2b1-3a08-bd3c-f38795b6c985	5	I really enjoyed this film! The tension is thick and simmering throughout, but moments of humor and beautiful shots of Michigan's scenery keep it in balance so that I was on the edge of my seat the whole time without feeling drained by the end. I also appreciate the ways in which this movie made me think. The story frame is dramatic and larger-than-life, but dealing with isolation and balancing idealization with reality are issues I believe we all struggle with. The commentary on class dynamics and privilege was another aspect that resonated; especially in the current times when the income gap in America continues to grow. I found this film entertaining, thought-provoking, and timely, and I would highly recommend it!
/m/up_on_the_glass	4e7b7df4-f2b1-3a08-bd3c-f38795b6c985	4.5	An intricately crafted thriller that captivates audiences with the terrifying question: do we really know our friends?
/m/up_on_the_glass	4e7b7df4-f2b1-3a08-bd3c-f38795b6c985	5	The script is well written, the acting and directing are great, and the setting adds a unique dimension because much of the film was filmed outdoors.  All of that combined results in an engrossing film.
/m/up_on_the_glass	4e7b7df4-f2b1-3a08-bd3c-f38795b6c985	5	I loved the movie! So well acted and shot and the plot was extremely suspenseful. Lovely moody original film.
/m/up_on_the_glass	4e7b7df4-f2b1-3a08-bd3c-f38795b6c985	5	Superbly written with dynamic characters.  The backdrop of Lake Michigan adds a unique dimension to a story that evades cliches.
/m/tom_of_your_life	c425b0c2-6391-3f31-b1de-ba0693a754b9	3.5	"A loving twisted fable"  The film was warm especially for Tom. I love the concept of the story and the lesson it brought throughout the film. For me the lesson was, 'You may aged so fast but the memories you treasure with someone close to your heart will never ever gets old.'
/m/tom_of_your_life	c425b0c2-6391-3f31-b1de-ba0693a754b9	5	A funny, moving, thought provoking movie, with a great original soundtrack perfectly tailored to the scenes. Plus skillfull and entertaining performances by Buzan, Sklar, all the Toms, and the other characters they encounter. There's a reason that noted critic Richard Roeper calls it one of his favorite movies of 2020.
/m/tom_of_your_life	c425b0c2-6391-3f31-b1de-ba0693a754b9	4	Tom of Your Life is gorgeous to watch with rich color and scenes, locations, and camera work. The story unfolds in a sweet telling that echoes in every detail, bends in the road, connection, uncertainty, endearing transaction of human purpose. Great film to take a little road trip into.
/m/guest_house	ff156a3d-2259-47ad-a9da-5472e4599ce5	5	I'm 33 years old and I've been a fan of Pauly Shore for a long time. He kind of fell off maybe for his own good but came back with an instant classic with this one. Heard about this movie through a few podcasts. Was it total fan of this one hilarious!! He's also a good stand-up comedian podcast host.  We need more movies from you Pauly.
/m/guest_house	ff156a3d-2259-47ad-a9da-5472e4599ce5	4	The Weez is back!! Best movie he's done since Biodome.   I feel sorry for people who can't just kick back and enjoy a good laugh, this was surprisingly good!
/m/guest_house	ff156a3d-2259-47ad-a9da-5472e4599ce5	2	Seemed like they forgot to put scenes in that would explain anything happening in the movie or background.
/m/guest_house	ff156a3d-2259-47ad-a9da-5472e4599ce5	0.5	Freaking awful! Worst film of the year!
/m/guest_house	ff156a3d-2259-47ad-a9da-5472e4599ce5	0.5	Painful to watch.  Not funny, childish humour, I felt bad for everyone involved in this movie. They must have needed the money to agree to be a part of it.  No redeeming features at all.
/m/guest_house	ff156a3d-2259-47ad-a9da-5472e4599ce5	0.5	Wow, what a piece of garbage.  I had to skip through a lot of the show it was so bad. Not funny and some very very bad acting by the 2 main actors.  Sad to see Bobby Lee, Pauley Shore, Billy Zane and more in this trash movie.
/m/guest_house	ff156a3d-2259-47ad-a9da-5472e4599ce5	0.5	no warmth and vulgarity for vulgarity's sake
/m/guest_house	ff156a3d-2259-47ad-a9da-5472e4599ce5	2	The movie was pretty funny. However, that's all the movie was. The rest of the movie was all of the place and very lazily executed
/m/guest_house	ff156a3d-2259-47ad-a9da-5472e4599ce5	2	Terrible but watchable . You get an occasional laugh 2.1
/m/guest_house	ff156a3d-2259-47ad-a9da-5472e4599ce5	1	This isn't a movie, just an excuse to show titties. Don't waste your time.
/m/the_2nd	c1ddabdb-a6a0-3161-99a4-5134db6bf1e2	0.5	really a sad waste of money, electricity, gas and time.
/m/the_2nd	c1ddabdb-a6a0-3161-99a4-5134db6bf1e2	0.5	Inicialmente, quando você busca entender o contexto do filme, ele te apresenta algo plausível e até que empolgante, visto que teremos um militar Boina Verde contra um grupos de assassinos extremamente preparados. Mas vamos lá, roteiro previsível, sem desenvolvimento dos personagens, dinâmica muito simples e porca, atores que infelizmente foram pessimamente escolhidos (o pai parece ser filho e o filho o pai). Avançando os minutos, percebo que a história é mal trabalhada e nem um pouco cativante, o roteiro usa coisas nada inteligentes. E eu to até agora pensando: COMO A DESGRAÇA DAQUELE HOMEM DESCABELADO NÃO MORREU EM NENHUM EMBATE, sendo que ele teve no mínimo dois embates corpo a corpo, para que apenas no final ele morresse, que o inspetor da faculdade nunca foi embora, ele estava na faculdade e com acordo com os assassinos, enfim, se eu fosse listar acontecimentos que transformam esse filme em um "meia estrela" não teria espaço neste comentário. Em uma palavra: FRACO!
/m/the_2nd	c1ddabdb-a6a0-3161-99a4-5134db6bf1e2	1	If your choice is this waste of movie time or a Steven Segal straight to video movie, always go with the Segal movie because you'll be far more entertained. I don't know how I could have survived this horrible script if it was not for the fast forward.
/m/the_2nd	c1ddabdb-a6a0-3161-99a4-5134db6bf1e2	0.5	Bad acting, bad direction, bad cinematography, horrible script.  Nothing redeemable about it.
/m/the_2nd	c1ddabdb-a6a0-3161-99a4-5134db6bf1e2	2.5	The whole story line was good, acting a little sub-par outside of the leads. Biggest issue was the random sword fight at the end, and really the end in general. Theres absolutely no justice, all that build up for basically no one to know what happened. Not to mention the very end where some random squad of guys waltz into the hospital with the leads wife ending in an unexplained battle... in public? Okay movie with no closure at all. I wouldn't recommend it.
/m/the_2nd	c1ddabdb-a6a0-3161-99a4-5134db6bf1e2	0.5	I'm using my veto on the sequel
/m/the_2nd	c1ddabdb-a6a0-3161-99a4-5134db6bf1e2	0.5	I wouldn't waste your time watching this terrible movie.  Horrible acting goes with a terrible script.  No stars for you.
/m/the_2nd	c1ddabdb-a6a0-3161-99a4-5134db6bf1e2	5	This movie was an absolute tour-de-force of action and a roller coaster of dramatic talent and acting excellence. Ryan Phillipe shines like the Oscar this movie deserved as a Top Secret, G-13 classified, double-secret probation Green Beret Delta Force Major with  an axe to grind against terrorism and the oppressions faced by rich college students at the hands of the CIA. Despite being a dead beat dad, Major Vick Davis kicks butt and takes no prisoners. Armed with only his wits, one-liners, and guns with unlimited ammo, he takes on the forces of evil as a supreme court justice's sword-swinging daughter is taken hostage. Only Vick and his dysfunctional, child-faced 20-something son can save her! Explosions! Gun fire! Amazing fight scene choreography! It's like John Woo and Jerry Bruckheimer had a baby, and then had...a 2nd.
/m/the_2nd	c1ddabdb-a6a0-3161-99a4-5134db6bf1e2	1	What a let down. Bad acting, poor visual effects and zero character development. I’ve seen this movie 10,000 times before.
/m/the_2nd	c1ddabdb-a6a0-3161-99a4-5134db6bf1e2	0.5	Awful and my expectations are low. Save your money and skip it. Cheesy and poorly done.
/m/range_runners	3cbe8e60-fd71-418c-954d-260e895ba3f5	5	Another rotten tomatoes fail. Such low ratings on such a good film. This is a great survival flick. The lead is such an awesome badass and is played with passion.
/m/range_runners	3cbe8e60-fd71-418c-954d-260e895ba3f5	4	I don't know why people are giving this movie such a low rating it was fresh, something I haven't seen before, and it seems to be a personal story for the writer, so bravo, this was a good movie, even though it was a small cast it was still impactful from beginning to end
/m/range_runners	3cbe8e60-fd71-418c-954d-260e895ba3f5	5	Great movie, and I'd still like to see it in movies.
/m/range_runners	3cbe8e60-fd71-418c-954d-260e895ba3f5	2	bad writing, unrealistic bad guys
/m/range_runners	3cbe8e60-fd71-418c-954d-260e895ba3f5	5	The movie is about survival and perseverance. Definitely enjoyed it!
/m/range_runners	3cbe8e60-fd71-418c-954d-260e895ba3f5	3	Good acting by main character but could have had a better plot and more action.
/m/range_runners	3cbe8e60-fd71-418c-954d-260e895ba3f5	4	A family friend worked on this film so we checked it out and WOW! Totally impressed and entertained and thrilled! The characters were great, the plot kept it interesting, I cringed, I yelled, "NO!!" And it was an overall good time. Definitely recommend 👍
/m/range_runners	3cbe8e60-fd71-418c-954d-260e895ba3f5	5	I was so inspired by this movie. Not only the story line, but the real life actors. Making a name for themselves by pouring their talents into this little film. With such a small cast, the characters filled the screen with grit and substance. I hope to see Celeste M. Cooper in more intense roles like this again. This film gave me something worthy to talk about with friends and family.
/m/range_runners	3cbe8e60-fd71-418c-954d-260e895ba3f5	5	Sequel Please! What more could this heroine do? She has it all: grit, dedication, perseverance, guts, resolve-gosh-just loved the character and the director must have eked all of these qualities out of this talented and energetic actress. The creepy quiet guy, the benevolent yet demanding dad, the beautiful scenery, and unstoppable action-I loved it! Make more, please!
/m/range_runners	3cbe8e60-fd71-418c-954d-260e895ba3f5	5	This is a thriller but it is far deeper than just a scary movie. The heroine, "Mel" is no ordinary woman – she is on a mission. She is strong - she is tough – she is driven by her gut to get it right. She learned to dig deep down from her father…get it right…push beyond your limits…run…faster…harder…never ever give up.  Mel never ever gives up. We watch her: she screams, she sweats, she runs, she bleeds, she fights…and woe be it to those who stand in her way. A magnificent character acted beautifully by Celeste Cooper. "Wayland" (Sean Patrick Leonard) is a truly evil, selfish, mean spirited and dangerous bully. Jared " Michael B. Woods is the frightened sidekick of Wayland. You would like to think that he had a conscience but he really is just terribly weak. Both actors do a wonderful job. The interplay between the characters is remarkably smooth thanks to the fine directing of Philip Plowden who clearly has a natural talent for directing. Devon Colwell' s screenplay is first rate. The cinematography, costumes, set design and score are well done.  The stunts were remarkably real and seamless. The movie is a resounding success due to the hard work and effort of all the cast and crew. Congratulations to all of you and thank you for bringing such thrilling entertainment to us. This is the first full length feature film from Fatal Funnel Films. I definitely look forward to the next one!
/m/the_owners_2020	7bccad94-9f16-301f-81c0-2cf2d28ab176	0.5	Dreadful from start to finish.
/m/the_owners_2020	7bccad94-9f16-301f-81c0-2cf2d28ab176	1	There was no real motivation for what was going on most of the time but the film's real crime was that it was a bore
/m/the_owners_2020	7bccad94-9f16-301f-81c0-2cf2d28ab176	0.5	Literally the worst movie I've ever seen
/m/the_owners_2020	7bccad94-9f16-301f-81c0-2cf2d28ab176	0.5	esse filme muito potencial,porém ele decai e fica horrível. Recheado de personagens burros
/m/the_owners_2020	7bccad94-9f16-301f-81c0-2cf2d28ab176	5	I love this movie! It kept me on my toes wondering what was going to happen next! It definitely did not disappoint!
/m/the_owners_2020	7bccad94-9f16-301f-81c0-2cf2d28ab176	1	Yet another somewhat foreign movie with excessive swearing and a boring beginning plus overused plotline. The ending didn't really make much sense and some of it was fairly predictable.
/m/the_owners_2020	7bccad94-9f16-301f-81c0-2cf2d28ab176	0.5	Too slow and waste of time.  Won't recommend to anyone to watch
/m/the_owners_2020	7bccad94-9f16-301f-81c0-2cf2d28ab176	3	It was okay. The first 3/4 were very good. Then it got a little too silly for me. The performances of the elderly couple steal the movie. They are amazing! The aspect ratio shifts to 4:3 for about 20 minutes at one point for no reason. It made it very distracting, I thought something was wrong with our Hulu. With a better third act, this would've been a great movie. Still, could do worse for a night in.
/m/the_owners_2020	7bccad94-9f16-301f-81c0-2cf2d28ab176	4	Very well-made, and although it's pretty obvious where things are headed from early on, the ride's good.
/m/the_owners_2020	7bccad94-9f16-301f-81c0-2cf2d28ab176	1	Started of mediocre and then went downhill
/m/still_here	b9da1715-d5d9-45ac-8153-62357fc30da0	5	A challenging, sad and true story about an issue we often see on the news, but still we are unfamiliar with. The movie is advertised and reviewed mostly as a story about racism and injustice, but all I could see was the story about the love a father has for his daughter, the story about a family going through a dark moment of their existence with good and bad. The decisions taken by the family will be questioned all along the film but I guess that is what makes this piece so honest and raw, the fact that we are different and everybody will act and behave different from each other.     The acting was great by McRae specially who plays the father but the rest of the cast builds a strong assembly. As well loved the beautiful cinematography and music. I read in other reviews that the ending feels rushed and I agree with that but as well I question if that was not a deliberate choice in order to keep our focus on the family.   Same like I did, I know that many of the viewers will identify themselves with characters from this film and maybe that is the strongest hook of the film.
/m/still_here	b9da1715-d5d9-45ac-8153-62357fc30da0	5	Beautiful, emotional movie.
/m/still_here	b9da1715-d5d9-45ac-8153-62357fc30da0	5	I was raised in Brooklyn close to where this story is set. I think it made the story a little too real for me. I loved the premise and the acting. It is an intense ride and deep experience. I feel very grateful this movies is out, watch it, it will only make you more human.
/m/still_here	b9da1715-d5d9-45ac-8153-62357fc30da0	3.5	It did keep me on the edge of my seat however it seemed to be a bit unbelievable now & then. Still, I enjoyed the film.
/m/still_here	b9da1715-d5d9-45ac-8153-62357fc30da0	5	This movie is filled with raw emotion and symbolism that will have your eyes watering throughout. The family relationship is very well tight all around. We need more stories around resilience and family like this one. I enjoyed the story and the beautiful acting. A timely film
/m/still_here	b9da1715-d5d9-45ac-8153-62357fc30da0	5	Thank you for telling this story
/m/still_here	b9da1715-d5d9-45ac-8153-62357fc30da0	5	A gripping crime drama. Excellent acting, specially from the father, who steals this film. A film that handles perfect multiple present social issues like systematic racism or human trafficking. If you are a parent this is a must see. Heartbreaking to understand that many of us are going though exactly same experience in real life like the Watson family.
/m/still_here	b9da1715-d5d9-45ac-8153-62357fc30da0	5	Great acting. Heartbreaking story. The father (McRae) is brilliant.
/m/still_here	b9da1715-d5d9-45ac-8153-62357fc30da0	0.5	look at all the fake audience reviews. this film was clearly garbage.
/m/still_here	b9da1715-d5d9-45ac-8153-62357fc30da0	4.5	IN A NUTSHELL: Inspired by a true story, this social drama offers a mystery, but also a serious look at the missing children epidemic in the world today. What's crazy is that another similar story was in the news only one week after the principal photography wrapped up and it happened just a few blocks from where the movie was filmed.  Written and directed by Vlad Feier. This is also his directorial debut! Great job!  According to the FBI's National Crime Information Center, there are a total of 465,676 active missing person records. As one of the characters in the movie says, "This is not just a police department's responsibility. It is the people's responsibility."  TIPS FOR PARENTS: This is a serious drama with no action or humor and with a very difficult topic. Profanity, including 1 F-bomb Most kids will be bored watching this. Parents will be heartbroken.  THEMES: Seeing through your soul, not just your eyes Truth Missing children Faith Hope Family, parenting  THINGS I LIKED: I thought Maurice McRae was excellent. I really felt his pain. I liked the honest and hopeful message of the film and that it brings to light an issue that is easily overlooked in society. No country is exempt. A lot of the cast was very good, except for a few overacting moments. It was really frustrating to see how corrupt and even apathetic the police department was. I know there are a lot of really great policemen who risk their lives every day to protect our communities, but I also believe that there are some bad cops like the ones portrayed in the film. The violent riots in the USA right now are not going to solve the problem. Cops are leaving their jobs and moving out of the cities in droves because of them. Then who is going to protect the people? Vigilantes? Defunding the police makes no sense. Retraining them or not hiring racists are two options. We all need to work together to solve problems. That may sound simplistic, but what's happening in the United States right now is definitely not helping. As a parent, I know it's impossible to be with your child every minute of the day. We need to teach our kids how to protect themselves and stay away from dangerous situations as much as possible. That doesn't guarantee our kids will be safe, but we can help increase their awareness and personal protection skills a little bit. I was happy to see faith introduced in the movie, even though this is not a Christian film. The portrayal of two Christian parents was honest and touching. Having faith definitely doesn't mean you won't ever have problems, but it can absolutely help you get through them.  THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: Some will reject and even be offended by the White Savior element in the story/movie. Some of the sound effects actually hurt my ears. The title of the movie is a giveaway. It's a bit of a slow burn. I like Zazie Beetz, so I was disappointed that she was only in one scene.  FUNNY LINES: None. This is a serious drama.  INTERESTING LINES:  "Everything has a price. What costs you is doubt." - cop "Kindness will affect the world and will help us find that common bond we are very much searching for." - Christian Baker (Johnny Whitworth) "God is good all the time." - Michael Watson (Maurice McRae) "We are not as separated as we think." - Christian Baker  You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel and website!
/m/black_boys	720e53df-21d9-3b41-b9e4-ce7668b92a09	5	Moving and powerful.
/m/black_boys	720e53df-21d9-3b41-b9e4-ce7668b92a09	5	I went through a roller coaster of emotions during this well thought out and touching film. I hope people watch it so it makes you look at the world through a different lens and that's enough for me. A beautiful and well done film broken into very thoughtful chapters and great sound mixing.
/m/black_boys	720e53df-21d9-3b41-b9e4-ce7668b92a09	5	This film is comprised of four sections that depict the experience of Blackness in the United States, and examines the fingerprints of history, violence, racism, and modern social life on Black communities. It's a restrained and poignant piece that lets viewers arrive at their own conclusions by seeing the world through the eyes of black men and boys. The Bodies section of the film particularly resonated with me, as a person who taught History and briefly studied "body" as an analytical lens in graduate school. The best part about the film, for me at least, is just hearing all of these men and kids sharing their experiences, because it's not something they'd normally share in casual conversation with white people (me, and the target audience).
/m/black_boys	720e53df-21d9-3b41-b9e4-ce7668b92a09	5	This important film dives into the root causes of the negative, and often dangerous, stereotypes that plague Black boys and men in American society. Director Sonia Lowman and the entire team created a beautiful, meaningful documentary that should be seen by all. Our society needs to listen and learn from the stories of these young men.
/m/black_boys	720e53df-21d9-3b41-b9e4-ce7668b92a09	5	Life changing!  Beautifully made.
/m/black_boys	720e53df-21d9-3b41-b9e4-ce7668b92a09	5	I cannot recommend this film enough. So so so important in our society and exceptional storytelling.
/m/black_boys	720e53df-21d9-3b41-b9e4-ce7668b92a09	5	This is a honest, candid, beautiful and hopeful film about black youth in America told mostly in their own words. I love this film. I love filmmaking. I love the editing. I have watched it three times already and learn something new every viewing. It's amazing and much needed storytelling in this time of transition.
/m/black_boys	720e53df-21d9-3b41-b9e4-ce7668b92a09	5	I was emotional the entire time and there was no looking away. This movie is "the work" we need to be doing as a country. I hope people that watch this engage with the hard conversations so we can move the needle forward.
/m/black_boys	720e53df-21d9-3b41-b9e4-ce7668b92a09	5	This poignant, honest, surprisingly beautiful and touching film is a must see for everyone interested in healing our country. I loved BLACK BOYS!
/m/black_boys	720e53df-21d9-3b41-b9e4-ce7668b92a09	5	It approaches a lot of important topics that are often overlooked in America. You get a full, unadulterated dose of cancerous white supremacy, social negligence and anti-blackness in the context of unchecked capitalism all from the viewpoint of one of society's most targeted demographics: the black man. It's a refreshing message: no we are not crazy and yes, we have been gaslit by the American historians of past In that America was great at one point. A country can never be great when it's foundation is set with the blood of our most vulnerable.
/m/robins_wish	da997ab6-b1dc-4e82-92d6-262aab15c809	5	Awesome! Robin's Wish covered every bit of Robin's end of life years... which have not been reflected in any of the earlier documentaries on Robin's life. Tylor Norwood is a brilliant cinematographer, director and Robin's Wish speaks to his brilliance in the details...the storyline, the doctors' views on the syndrome, the music which synced with the story said it all.
/m/robins_wish	da997ab6-b1dc-4e82-92d6-262aab15c809	4.5	Very powerful documentary about Robin Williams' suicide in August 2014, the diagnosis post-mortem of Lewy's Body Dementia and how it robbed him of everything he lived for. Especially moving is his widow Susan's eloquence and the love he engendered in so many of his friends, neighbours and complete strangers. Lots of clips of him on and off-screen, and of real interest to anyone with even a passing interest in the brain and its fragility.
/m/robins_wish	da997ab6-b1dc-4e82-92d6-262aab15c809	3.5	The widow of Robin Williams is hoping to set the record straight  about the death of her husband.  Williams suffered from diffuse Lewy body disease which impacted his acting career and contributed to his death by suicide.  I had never heard of it.  The film explains what Williams went through late in his life via the words of those closest to him.  There are some really cool behind the scenes stories and the ending broke me in half.  Final Score: 7/10
/m/robins_wish	da997ab6-b1dc-4e82-92d6-262aab15c809	3.5	Robin Williams fue un genio sin duda alguna, una persona admirable, explosiva y enferma, sufrió de demencia con cuerpos de Lewy,  el segundo tipo más común de demencia progresiva después de la demencia por enfermedad de Alzheimer. El documental va sobre los últimos días de Williams, los comentarios de sus amigos cercanos, sus vecinos y su viuda, así como de la explicación científica de la enfermedad y los dolorosos síntomas que tuvo que enfrentar al final de sus días. Interesante, pero un tanto plano y aburrido, las declaraciones de la viuda dan la sensación de ser falsas, actuadas.
/m/robins_wish	da997ab6-b1dc-4e82-92d6-262aab15c809	2	Yeah, a bunch of Williams friends and work mates doing the usual American over exaggeration of his alleged brilliance. Better to ask an international audience whether they think he was a great comedian. not a group of his mates trying to create a legacy. It comes across as all things American i.e.l fake.
/m/robins_wish	da997ab6-b1dc-4e82-92d6-262aab15c809	5	An excellent peek into the life of one of the most brilliant minds, that of Robin Williams.  Who would have thought that he was suffering for so long? The sound track is excellent as well, by Sean Price of Pricetone Studios.
/m/robins_wish	da997ab6-b1dc-4e82-92d6-262aab15c809	3.5	Verdict: As a fan of Robin Williams, this movie is nostalgic and also heartbreaking. Robins Wish (2020) Pays Tribute to the beloved actor Robin Williams, a full of life human being. Oh, captain my captain, you will forever be remembered.
/m/robins_wish	da997ab6-b1dc-4e82-92d6-262aab15c809	2	Too bad that the documentary talks more about his death than about his life. And it talks A LOT (too much) about Susan Schneider...
/m/robins_wish	da997ab6-b1dc-4e82-92d6-262aab15c809	3.5	While the documentary doesn´t cover much new ground in the world of the disease its covering and even Robin Williams, it should count as a proper goodbye that shows the work of a great one-of-a-kind comedy legend.
/m/robins_wish	da997ab6-b1dc-4e82-92d6-262aab15c809	4	So sad, but totally worth the watch. What an amazing person.
/m/first_one_in	27d60072-97a7-48e1-b12f-e4160482d163	4	This is my exact type of movie 3.8
/m/first_one_in	27d60072-97a7-48e1-b12f-e4160482d163	5	Very funny story of a woman who overcomes a disaster on a reality TV show to find self redemption in her career and on the tennis court.  I like that she doesn't need romance to fulfill her life.  Not very realistic but many laughs and overall very satisfing
/m/summerland_2020_2	80d21130-44f8-4775-8139-e918840c14f3	1.5	I am a big fan of LGBTQ cinema and was eager to give this a watch due to recent positive reviews. However, this movie is poorly acted and executed. I did finish it all although at times it was a struggle because it feels much longer than it's actual run time. Very disappointing.
/m/summerland_2020_2	80d21130-44f8-4775-8139-e918840c14f3	0.5	As a gay man myself I was interested in watching this movie because I heard it was supposed to challenge gay stereotypes often presented in movies. However, it turned out to be a movie super full of itself for thinking it was busting gay stereotypes while adhering to plenty and patting itself on the back for thinking it's not. It's a privileged-attractive cisgender white gay man's version of "breaking stereotypes". I even read an interview with one of the stars Chris Ball about how his boyfriend advised him not to get in-shape for the role because not all gays needed to have abs. Mister Ball is clearly in-shape compared to your average person and if he thinks not having a complete six pack but otherwise still being an in-shape conventionally attractive gay man is in someway breaking stereotypes, it truly shows how privileged his background is and homogeneous the nature of his social circle must be. There is nothing wrong with being in shape, but the fact he thinks he is making a statement by simply not having abs is somehow groundbreaking is really sad and tone deaf. This seems to be a movie you would really enjoy if you are part of one of those all white homogeneous gay social circles, but probably won't enjoy otherwise.
/m/gather	1cc4169d-a231-4a18-9ec5-8003bdd7f76a	4	This moving and inspiring film looks at four grassroots initiatives aiming to restore and regenerate food sovereignty by and for indigenous Native Americans. The initiatives range from a new food cafe on the White Mountain Reservation; restoring the skills and rights of fishing on the Klamath River of northern California; reviving the ancient knowledge and skills of foraging for wild plants and animals; and demonstrating the nutritional superiority of grass-fed buffalo and revitalising buffalo as a source of spiritual and physical nourishment.
/m/american_street_kid	51cbb930-5d4f-3b54-a578-867695c9cb90	5	American Street Kid is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. It is such a raw piece of art filled with so much emotion. This film goes above and beyond to break the stigmas and the silence around homeless youth. Not only did I cry multiple times throughout this film in happiness and sadness, I felt every wave of emotion: anger, joy, sympathy, empathy, courage, and inspiration. Michael Leoni does an impeccable job immersing himself into this lifestyle to make it as authentic as possible. It is a must watch.
/m/american_street_kid	51cbb930-5d4f-3b54-a578-867695c9cb90	5	The impact that this film could have on the US if every American would see this film just once would be amazing. American Street Kid truly shines a light on the terrible issues surrounding youth homelessness. These issues are ones that should be talked about more as there are so many misconceptions and false assumptions today that this film addresses. By showing real compassion, frustration, and fluctuating hope, the audience is forced to see these harsh realities of youth and prove so many of the previously mentioned misconceptions wrong. The film is extremely powerful and could be such a strong catalyst for change.
/m/american_street_kid	51cbb930-5d4f-3b54-a578-867695c9cb90	5	This film encouraged me to think more deeply about the homeless crisis in this nation and truly understand the humanity and what's at stake. The adversity these children face is relentless, often from birth, and what they have to do to simply survive on this planet is unspeakable. The movie presents an honest view of what life is really like for these kids, and shows some success stories--what these kids can accomplish with some help, someone to listen and act, someone seeing them as human beings and believing in them. It shows how bleak and harsh street life is, and how hopeless and unhelpful current programs are. We must do better and a good place to start is watching this film, developing an understanding, then ACTING for change.
/m/american_street_kid	51cbb930-5d4f-3b54-a578-867695c9cb90	5	American Street Kid sheds light on a very overlooked problem in our world. This documentary was extremely moving and brought me to tears. Everyone should go watch this!
/m/american_street_kid	51cbb930-5d4f-3b54-a578-867695c9cb90	5	This film is a wake up call and a powerful reminder that the human spirit conquers all. A must see documentary film!
/m/american_street_kid	51cbb930-5d4f-3b54-a578-867695c9cb90	5	American Street Kid is a documentary unlike anything I've seen before. It is raw, real, unflinching, and full of hope. The stories of the street kids on screen give a human face to the troubling issue of youth homelessness and will stick with you for a long time. The friendship between director Michael Leoni and his subjects is so inspiring. Hopeful as it is heartbreaking, American Street Kid will move you to tears and real change. It is a must-watch!
/m/american_street_kid	51cbb930-5d4f-3b54-a578-867695c9cb90	5	Loved this documentary.  You will go through a gamut of emotions. As a parent I can't imagine throwing away your child. Everyone should should see this!
/m/american_street_kid	51cbb930-5d4f-3b54-a578-867695c9cb90	5	This film calls to light a too often overlooked issue, and accomplishes it in a very powerful way. For those vastly unaware that teen homelessness is an issue in the United States, it will be eye opening. For those aware, but don't know where to begin, this film has the power to lead a movement. This film will touch your heart and mobilize the masses into working towards a solution.
/m/american_street_kid	51cbb930-5d4f-3b54-a578-867695c9cb90	5	This is a gut wrenching documentary offering a rare glimpse of street life for the kids just trying to make it through each day in the streets. Their distrust as the director tries to make a connection with them and the vulnerability as they allow him to become a part of their lives is tangible and emotionally powerful. It tears down preconceived notions of why kids are on the streets and what they are looking for. It gives  you hope and a desire to bring about change. A work of compassion, desperation and love. Well worth the cost of a latte to rent... even worth the cost of a happy meal to buy.
/m/american_street_kid	51cbb930-5d4f-3b54-a578-867695c9cb90	5	"American Street Kid" is not just a movie. It's the heart showing us that life goes beyond just being human.......it shows that no matter what....... we all need to know that there is still love out there for us no matter where we are in life. Michael Leoni Showed that love beats anything. He showed that any staircase of pain can be destroyed by just showing your heart. Some of the kids in the movie, Ish, greenz, nick, crystal, bubbles, and more are all apart of my heart forever and ever. Their power to shutdown their pain through love is the most amazing and beautiful thing I've ever seen. "American Street Kid", Your heart will thank you!
/m/ravage_2020	c56b3623-e2af-46f4-9674-c287448c63a2	1	1 star for the effort and some imagination - wicked ending - plus Bruce Dern's character and acting. But it feels unnecessary, too violent, depraved and, above all, depressing beyond redemption.
/m/ravage_2020	c56b3623-e2af-46f4-9674-c287448c63a2	0.5	Not enjoyable any minute. The directing is sloppy, the dialogues are dumb and many times it feels amateurish and too badly conventional. Brings nothing new, and nothing short, to the table of the rape and revenge genre. A waste of time.
/m/ravage_2020	c56b3623-e2af-46f4-9674-c287448c63a2	0.5	Scheiss Film! Zeit und Geld verschwendung!!!
/m/ravage_2020	c56b3623-e2af-46f4-9674-c287448c63a2	1	Surprised at the low ratings. I liked it. Edit: I just saw the ending. Nevermind. Don't waste your time. I hate those stupid endings. Grrrr.
/m/ravage_2020	c56b3623-e2af-46f4-9674-c287448c63a2	0.5	What could have been a good revenge movie turned into a piece of garbage. Save your time and dignity and don't bother with this pathetic and twisted travesty.
/m/ravage_2020	c56b3623-e2af-46f4-9674-c287448c63a2	0.5	Absolutely horrible! If I could give it zero 🌟 stars I would. Completely depraved, however, that would've been ok. But, the ending was the worst 😫 ever! Don't watch.

/m/ravage_2020	c56b3623-e2af-46f4-9674-c287448c63a2	0.5	Had to be the stupidest ending ever.
/m/ravage_2020	c56b3623-e2af-46f4-9674-c287448c63a2	3	It is a well done movie with plenty of tension. Unfortunately, This story has been done before. It is worth a watch and I wished that the Director had put more into it.
/m/ravage_2020	c56b3623-e2af-46f4-9674-c287448c63a2	5	Great... Ending a bit brief but loved this
/m/bill_and_ted_face_the_music	361a8bbe-f080-3a7a-a138-87ed07db9f97	1.5	It was completely ridiculous. The movie was a complete waste of resources to make and a complete waste of time watching.
/m/bill_and_ted_face_the_music	361a8bbe-f080-3a7a-a138-87ed07db9f97	4.5	A clever sequel, tying up loose ends and lots of laughs!
/m/bill_and_ted_face_the_music	361a8bbe-f080-3a7a-a138-87ed07db9f97	3.5	No where near as good as the first but had a few good laughs.
/m/bill_and_ted_face_the_music	361a8bbe-f080-3a7a-a138-87ed07db9f97	1.5	It is probably one of the most boring movies out there, and I've seen Plan 9 From Outer Space
/m/bill_and_ted_face_the_music	361a8bbe-f080-3a7a-a138-87ed07db9f97	0.5	So dissappointing. No character development for Bill & Ted being middle aged former rock stars. Undermining the ending of the last movie.
/m/bill_and_ted_face_the_music	361a8bbe-f080-3a7a-a138-87ed07db9f97	1.5	Exactly as expected, Bill & Ted Face the Music gives us…well, Bill & Ted. The film is pretty much on a par with the original (and it's first sequel): a best bud dope fest fueled by dumbass-erry. The plot is simple and implausible. The acting is, well, bad. But Bill & Ted are old. And there is no Rufus to save the day or the film. Skip it and hold on to the nostalgia of the originals.
/m/bill_and_ted_face_the_music	361a8bbe-f080-3a7a-a138-87ed07db9f97	5	SPOILERS  I found it to be most excellent but I'm exactly the age of the characters so that may have something to do with it.  Like Bill and Ted, I put crushing pressure on myself to do amazing things, and like Bill and Ted, I've failed. Seeing the two of them so abjectly fail, and seeing their daughters love them anyway was sweet for me. The grimace Keanu carried through the movie spoke to me.  When they dropped everything to try to fix their marriages, when their love for music and their families had helped their daughters grow into better, smarter versions of themselves; when they instantly handed over the reins to the next generation with respect and humility and love, when all their fumbled attempts to do great things turned out to have been wasted and THEY DIDN'T CARE because their love for their daughters and music was stronger than their love for themselves, I cried. I cried when they helped play the song with Kid Cudi on the freeway, so I watched the stupid formulaic ending that we all saw coming from the beginning of the movie with tears blurring my vision. They were failures, abject failures, at everything but love and optimism, and in the end that was enough. Better people came in to take their place, and those people would never have existed if not for Bill and Ted's unflagging love and optimism, and in the end, generosity.
/m/bill_and_ted_face_the_music	361a8bbe-f080-3a7a-a138-87ed07db9f97	3	If you saw the originals you will like this though the first 15 min are super cringe worthy.  Over all dumb and bad but still loveable.
/m/bill_and_ted_face_the_music	361a8bbe-f080-3a7a-a138-87ed07db9f97	1	Awful. Just awful. I find it hilarious that the "score" for this was in the upper 80's while the ORIGINAL film only scored in the mid 60's.  The insanity of score manipulation is an insult to the intelligence of rotten tomatoes readers and participants. It undermines the entire construct and premise of this site.
/m/bill_and_ted_face_the_music	361a8bbe-f080-3a7a-a138-87ed07db9f97	0.5	What garbage! Critics are out of their minds. Terrible acting, script, special effects. Cobbled together mess! Gross!
/m/open_24_hours_2018	093791fa-1270-490b-9182-5be380323f6d	3.5	Good acting with likeable characters that you hate to see anything bad happen too. Vanessa Grasse is great in this movie and Emily Tennant is good as well.
/m/open_24_hours_2018	093791fa-1270-490b-9182-5be380323f6d	4	Bloody, brutal and an excellent lead protagonist!
/m/open_24_hours_2018	093791fa-1270-490b-9182-5be380323f6d	0.5	I'm amazed that people would still make stupid movies like this in the 21st century. e.g. in the last gas station scene with the predator, the woman and a man. (1) After the woman freed herself, instead of freeing the man right away she was told to get a gun from a locked locker. (2) After the man was freed instead of him taking the gun he asked the meek girl to try to shoot the predator. (3) The truck driver saw the gas station drenched and called the police, instead of waiting safely in the locked truck he roamed slowly around the gas station until he got killed. (4) The cop arrived, knew there was a dangerous predator around, instead of taking the girl to a safe distance he stayed there and let himself be killed. (5) After the cop was killed there was no follow-up cops to come and investigate why the 1st cop had lost communication. The storyteller was absolutely detached from reality, just like the Korean movies.
/m/open_24_hours_2018	093791fa-1270-490b-9182-5be380323f6d	4	Definitely hits the mark of what it's meant to do. Executed and delivered.
/m/open_24_hours_2018	093791fa-1270-490b-9182-5be380323f6d	3	‘Open 24 Hours' Is Wide Open For Gore
/m/open_24_hours_2018	093791fa-1270-490b-9182-5be380323f6d	3	i didn't think this was that bad, actually; maybe a little confusing at first - it was hard to tell what was one of her delusions & what was actually happening. & you don't really find out why she's so paranoid until pretty late in the story too so everything seems kind of random up until that point. i didn't hate the story; but we never find out why SHE went to jail, right? or did we & i just missed that part? idk. there seemed to be some plot holes & not great story telling tactics in some places, but overall i didn't hate it.
/m/open_24_hours_2018	093791fa-1270-490b-9182-5be380323f6d	1	The story needs a little help. No effort with the ending.
/m/open_24_hours_2018	093791fa-1270-490b-9182-5be380323f6d	3.5	A slasher film about felony convicted now out-of-prison Mary who is starting a new life after a traumatic experience with her serial killer boyfriend by getting a new job at a 24-hour gas station on a graveyard shift. Mary's start of new life seems to have a good head start but her delusions and paranoia caused by her trauma starts to affect her including seeing her boyfriend. Her struggle and choices between reality and not in her mental state will ultimately decide her fate. The story is interesting. This is a slasher survival horror movie that happens in one-day period range. It is a horror slasher film but it also somewhat wants to be a psychological thriller film as well yet it fails make a solid connection or exploration of the psychological theme by the conclusion of the movie. The jump scare tropes and tense moments is a hit for me. And I'm sure fans of this movie genre will surely like this thrill ride. But I just wish Open 24 Hours sustain its psychological aspects until the end or take a different climax leaning to mental health issue because it ended just as like an ordinary slasher film which is not a cut above the rest of the same genre films.
/m/open_24_hours_2018	093791fa-1270-490b-9182-5be380323f6d	5	Good, spooky and keeps you on the edge of the seat. Wait for the next move from the ex boyfriend.
/m/open_24_hours_2018	093791fa-1270-490b-9182-5be380323f6d	2	It started off promising but by the last half-hour it was downright lazy...there's a good story in here somewhere, but the filmmakers lost the chance to do something special and decided to take a worn-out path instead.
/m/the_prey_2020	37e33d24-0f14-4fe0-908f-96ff895e6033	2.5	Passes the time. Low, low budget.
/m/benjamin	f7713c79-1a85-4da4-abb7-190b9255b3df	3	I like my quirky indie comedy-romances as much as the next person, but I just didn't find this very funny. A game cast and some touching love scenes, but it only raises the odd smile.
/m/benjamin	f7713c79-1a85-4da4-abb7-190b9255b3df	5	This replaced my my personal favorite Gay relationship rating.  "Parting Glances" has held that position for a very long time, but "Benjamin" just bumped it to #2.  Both have fringe elements that are funny but realistic -- there really are people like that, just not in the mainstream of Gay life.  But the core value in both movies is "how to make a bond that's solid, caring, and enduring in Gay life."  Slowly -- very slowly in many places -- it's becoming easier in patches across the world.  Both of these movies show it can be done by trodding the same bumpy road to success that men and women travel, and with the same 21st Century awareness of what the value is in bonding.  Neither movie is for people who are afraid of relationships.  Both are for people who want it and are willing to work on achieving it and making it last.  Bravo!
/m/benjamin	f7713c79-1a85-4da4-abb7-190b9255b3df	4.5	A BRILLIANT portrayal of a basket case!  Nothing predictable here.  Really enjoyed this quirky and unusual Rom-Com.  Nearly every major character is "weird" in their own special way.  Everything flows smoothly and lead actor does a BRILLIANT job.  I found the two pivotal scenes PURE GENIUS:  1.) Bathtub scene and 2.) closing scene  It shows that once you shut up and get out of your own head; you can break through and LIVE!!  LOVED THIS
/m/benjamin	f7713c79-1a85-4da4-abb7-190b9255b3df	4	Quirky and awkward artists' behaviour depicted in this funny, sensitive, romantic yet oddly truthful gay film featuring two pretty stars, ex-TV's "Merlin" actor Colin Morgan and French kid Phenix Brossard. Relatable, swift and uplifting. Watched twice back to back, thoroughly enjoyable.
/m/benjamin	f7713c79-1a85-4da4-abb7-190b9255b3df	3.5	A charming romantic comedy that shows love comes when we least expect it.  Simon Amstell, who wrote and directed his first feature length film, has the issues a first time filmmaker would expect.  When the movie focuses the romance it's wonderful, but when it doesn't it stalls.  The words here are important and they're brilliant, and the ending keeps this in the fresh category.  I could see this are a three-film set in the eyes of the Linklater trilogy.  There's no doubting Amstell is a talent to watch.  Final Score: 6.7/10
/m/benjamin	f7713c79-1a85-4da4-abb7-190b9255b3df	5	Quirky and delightful with lovely performances.
/m/benjamin	f7713c79-1a85-4da4-abb7-190b9255b3df	5	Colin Morgan is brilliant in this sparkling and original film. Very tender as well as funny.
/m/benjamin	f7713c79-1a85-4da4-abb7-190b9255b3df	5	My new favorite film that I've been recommending to everyone. A witty, relatable romcom about an awkward filmmaker. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. Amazing performances all around, and brilliant one-liners that I'll be quoting for years to come!
/m/benjamin	f7713c79-1a85-4da4-abb7-190b9255b3df	4.5	The film lacks in the character development for the supporting characters, however, the leading performance is absolutely mesmerizing. Great music, story, and not mellow-dramatic. It was very grounded and real in every way.
/m/benjamin	f7713c79-1a85-4da4-abb7-190b9255b3df	5	It's funny but also dark at the same time. It has a good balance of light-heartedness and seriousness that keeps you peeled to the screen.
/m/cane_river	48dd2f41-b993-371a-a7cb-cc0b4a194f7b	1	Boring. Don’t waste your money and time.

/m/pariah_dog	d17f9328-edd2-3a4e-8fc6-28b63806fa5b	4	Gritty, quirky, will pull at the heartstrings of anyone who loves animals and feels for their suffering.  It's overwhelming to think of the problem of street dogs in any country where they are out of control, and at the same time it's uplifting to see the kindness of human beings who do what they can to make a difference.  The movie did a good job of giving us a glimpse of street dog life and the humans who care about them. Please spread the word so that this movie can raise awareness about spay/neuter and rabies organizations who need funds to continue their good work, too.
/m/pariah_dog	d17f9328-edd2-3a4e-8fc6-28b63806fa5b	5	Excellent documentary film!! A must see for any animal lover who cannot see the suffering of innocent animals.  Everyone must see this and hope this leads to the END of the suffering!!
/m/pariah_dog	d17f9328-edd2-3a4e-8fc6-28b63806fa5b	5	Amazing film! Inspirational, artistic, heart wrenching and beautiful.

/m/desert_one	a592bdd6-d549-4d78-a761-489f9b7af31e	5	Well made with many details new to me.  Emotionally impactful as well.  I recommend watching with "Jimmy Carter Rock and Roll President" and "Argo".
/m/desert_one	a592bdd6-d549-4d78-a761-489f9b7af31e	5	Revealing and as poignant today as it was in 1980. Great film-making, it will be useful for many as perspective for how American politics and international relations took a sharp turn.
/m/matthias_and_maxime	1b3c25bf-412b-3728-be00-120621d7921b	4.5	Devastatingly beautiful and poignant, the film is stylistically diverse, well-paced, well-acted, and feels heart-achingly honest. Xavier impresses once more for the rawness of his acting and directing.

The chemistry between Matthias and maxime is phenomenal and some of the best I've seen but the ending and the very slow pacing and randomness in between them not being together and that separation throughout the film killed the films pacing. I wanted more of them but I know why the film makers decided not to because that's not how it works in real life. My thing to what I just said is real life at times is very boring and I don't care about the work of either characters or them doing random stuff that people normally do. For some people that'll work but for me they could've cut the randomness. 2 hours for a movie is long especially for this. I wanted for. This could've been amazing. They had the right ingredients and man the acting is phenomenal. Both of the main characters give Oscar worthy performances but man the script, the pacing, the realness of it  killed it for me. I truly like the characters of Matthias and maxime but gosh dang it I wanted a Hollywood ending but I know that's not how life works sometimes but gosh dang it.

/m/matthias_and_maxime	1b3c25bf-412b-3728-be00-120621d7921b	2.5	(Español / English)  Xavier Dolan aborda en este filme varias cuestiones: la posibilidad de una  salida del closet de dos hombres al cabo de una relación de años, el final de la juventud, los caminos divergentes que pueden separar a dos personas, la relación con las madres (propias y ajenas) y la responsabilidades filiales. Pero Llamentablemente todos esos planos narrativos no terminan de combinarse y potenciarse entre sí.   Xavier Dolan addresses several issues in this film: the possibility of two men coming out of the closet after a relationship of years, the end of youth, the divergent paths that can separate two people, the relationship with their mothers (own and others) and affiliate responsibilities. But unfortunately all those narrative planes do not finish combining and enhancing each other.   Matthias y Maxime son amigos desde la infancia. El primero (Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas) es un apuesto abogado con una carrera ascendente y en pareja con un mujer, mientras que el segundo (Xavier Dolan), convive con su madre adicta en recuperación (Anne Dorval) y está preparando una viaje para pasar al menos dos años en Australia. Como resultado de una apuesta, ambos deben participar de un cortometraje en el cual se besan, situación que desencadenará cuestionamientos en ambos.  Xavier Dolan aborda en este filme varias cuestiones: la posibilidad de una  salida del closet de dos hombres al cabo de una relación de años, el final de la juventud, los caminos divergentes que pueden separar a dos personas, la relación con las madres (propias y ajenas) y la responsabilidades filiales.  El proceso entre ambos protagonistas recuerda en parte a las películas del argentino Marco Berger, con argumentos consistentes en esperar a que ambos consumen un encuentro sexual luego de acumular tensión erótica durante toda la película, sólo que la acumulación de tensión (sexual y afectiva) está casi ausente en la película de Dolan, proceso al que contribuyen sus elipsis y el abordaje de los protagonistas.  El adiós a la juventud está dado por las ruidosas y festivas escenas con su grupo de amigos de diferentes extracciones sociales, en escenas demasiado prolongadas que en general no aportan al desarrollo dramático y brindan algún momento de humor algo desvaído.  La relación (siempre) conflictiva con la madre es todo un tópico en las películas de Dolan: aparece también en  Yo maté a mi madre y en Mommy y, en los tres casos con Anne Dorval en ese papel.  Lamentablemente, además,  todos esos planos no terminan de combinarse y potenciarse y algunos hasta se tornan de a ratos molestos por su dispersión. Por supuesto, la película está bien filmada, con algunas imágenes logradas, algunos detalles de edición  y una interesante banda sonora.  Matthias y Maxime es otro ejemplo que demuestra que Dolan funciona mejor y logra relatos más potentes y efectivos cuando opera lo lúdico, como lo han demostrado Los amores imaginarios y acaso la mejor de sus películas, Tom en la granja.   Matthias and Maxime have been friends since childhood. The first (Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas) is a handsome lawyer with an upward career and in a relationship with a woman, while the second (Xavier Dolan), lives with his recovering addicted mother (Anne Dorval) and is preparing a trip to spend at least two years in Australia. As a result of a bet, both must participate in a short film in which they kiss, a situation that will trigger questions in both.  Xavier Dolan addresses several issues in this film: the possibility of two men coming out of the closet after a relationship of years, the end of youth, the divergent paths that can separate two people, the relationship with their mothers (own and others) and affiliate responsibilities.  The process between the two protagonists is partly reminiscent of the films by Argentine Marco Berger, with arguments consisting of waiting for both to consume a sexual encounter after accumulating erotic tension throughout the film, only that the accumulation of tension (sexual and affective) is almost absent in Dolan's film, a process to which his ellipsis and the approach of the protagonists contribute.  The goodbye to youth is given by the noisy and festive scenes with his group of friends from different social backgrounds, in scenes that are too long that in general do not contribute to the dramatic development and provide some moment of somewhat faded humor.  The (always) conflictive relationship with the mother is a topic in Dolan's films: it also appears in I killed my mother and in Mommy and, in all three cases, with Anne Dorval in that role.  Unfortunately, in addition, all these planes do not finish combining and enhancing each other and some even become annoying from time to time due to their dispersion. Of course, the movie is well shot, with some slick images, some editing details, and an interesting soundtrack.  Matthias and Maxime is another example that shows that Dolan works better and achieves more powerful and effective stories when he operates the playful, as The Imaginary Loves and perhaps the best of his films, Tom at the Farm have shown.
/m/matthias_and_maxime	1b3c25bf-412b-3728-be00-120621d7921b	4.5	the kiss scene is one of the most moving scene I've ever seen
/m/matthias_and_maxime	1b3c25bf-412b-3728-be00-120621d7921b	3	Harris Dickinson is the joy in this wrought melodrama.
/m/matthias_and_maxime	1b3c25bf-412b-3728-be00-120621d7921b	3.5	I'd thought 2013's Tom At The Farm had put me off Xavier Dolan's films for good, until I caught his latest, now available on MUBI, and I'm thankful for second chances. Dolan directs, writes and co-stars as Maxine, a 20-something about to leave for Australia and leaving behind his irascible mother who's recovering from addiction and a circle of friends from various economic and social strata that he grew up with, including his best friend, Matthias. Hints that their relationship is complicated surface when they end up shooting a kissing scene in their friend's sister's film project. This is queer indie drama that marinates in what was unspoken but merely referenced to in passing or via expressions of anguish, anxiety and repressed passion on the main leads' faces, and a deliberate birthmark on Maxine's that will lead to an emotional outburst with catalytic consequences. Dolan's reserved but resolute Maxine contrasts with newcomer Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas's confident on the outside yet vulnerable on the inside portrayal of Matthias. Whilst we're unsure if Matthias's girlfriend is being too liberal-minded/Canadian or just blissfully unaware and his mother is a warm and poignant contrast to Maxine's mother, at least they serve a narrative purpose; unlike the introduction of Harris Dickinson's visiting lawyer whose jarring storyline seems to go nowhere. Instead of frustration and irritation, I was engaged and almost enamoured with the film's slow build towards an increasingly revealing and tender depiction of a forbidden/unrequited love and the very effective evocation of the camaraderie between the close-knit group of friends. Andre Turpin's cinematography further provides nicely composed visual shots and pans that adds artistry and nuances to Dolan's slick and good-looking film which, abrupt and ambiguous indie-movie ending notwithstanding, demonstrates, at least for this film, a welcoming maturity and accessibility, in his work.
/m/matthias_and_maxime	1b3c25bf-412b-3728-be00-120621d7921b	5	Absolutely brilliant. I've seen some of Dolan's earlier films, and this feels in a lot of ways like what he was building towards. A lot of the angst and erratic feelings that filled those works mature here into something truly beautiful. I liked his earlier works, but I connected to this movie. Maybe we're all a bit like Max and Matthias, one feeling so alone and lost and the other feeling so pressured and trapped. Whatever the reason, I fell in love with these characters and their relationship. I look forward to whatever Dolan does next.
/m/matthias_and_maxime	1b3c25bf-412b-3728-be00-120621d7921b	5	Em atuação o Dolan só está abaixo em Tom À La Ferme. Esse filme me parece uma transição pra uma nova fase do Dolan e eu quero dar todo o apoio possível neste momento.
/m/matthias_and_maxime	1b3c25bf-412b-3728-be00-120621d7921b	3	Matthias & Maxime pales in comparison with Xavier Dolan's early successes, with its restrained atmosphere somewhat being below his own standards.
/m/tesla	0ab98413-a322-4293-b748-a5899e5507a9	3	I found it to be a little boring and not sure which direction the movie was headed!
/m/tesla	0ab98413-a322-4293-b748-a5899e5507a9	2	Tesla was evidently a brilliant man, but this biopic isn't. The history of his contribution is overshadowed by trying to tell the pieces of his story in ways that don't work well together.
/m/tesla	0ab98413-a322-4293-b748-a5899e5507a9	1.5	Total and utter garbage. Some moron decided to take what could have been an interesting story and turn it into an idiotic art piece that is filled with just terrible direction and production decisions. I didn't even think "The Current War" was all that great, but at least it was watchable. Whoever greenlit this idea is an idiot, and anybody who knew what this would be and didn't immediately quit the project deserves to have their judgement questioned in the future.
/m/tesla	0ab98413-a322-4293-b748-a5899e5507a9	1.5	I really cant believe that N. Tesla was so wooden and never changed his expression. Continual frown,bland, flat dialogue by Hawke. Couldnt wait for it to end.
/m/tesla	0ab98413-a322-4293-b748-a5899e5507a9	3	I liked its bold approach to the typically stuffy biopic genre, but it misses as often as it hits and a strong first half loses its spark in the second. Maybe that's the point, Tesla promised more than he could deliver, but that doesn't make for a satisfying narrative for a film.
/m/tesla	0ab98413-a322-4293-b748-a5899e5507a9	3	Interesting biopic. Shame that it didn't focus on all of his inventions 6/10
/m/tesla	0ab98413-a322-4293-b748-a5899e5507a9	1.5	I really wanted to like this movie, because I think Tesla was a great man. But this was terrible. It was completely disjointed, so much that it was hard to follow. There was no character development, no relationship between the characters, no narrative thread. Ethan Hawks did no acting: he maintained the same scowl throughout the whole movie. The way it was filmed was weird and unpleasant. Completely wasted 2 hours.
/m/tesla	0ab98413-a322-4293-b748-a5899e5507a9	3	Interesting to watch, but didn't work for me overall.
/m/tesla	0ab98413-a322-4293-b748-a5899e5507a9	2.5	Very surreal, not a documentary or a joker like follow someone into madness. Very little on his inventions.  There are much better Tesla documentaries available.
/m/tesla	0ab98413-a322-4293-b748-a5899e5507a9	1.5	Disjointed, confusing and weak. Inaccurately portrays one of the greatest inventors and minds the world has ever see. For some reason J.P Morgan's daughter is main character and switches between lead role and looking at camera talking to audience using modern day technology. When Tesla sings Tear For Fears - Everyone Wants To Rule The World I had to make an account here and rate it. It was so bad I believe it was funded by The Edison Estate
/m/fatima_2020	01d5f6ec-5177-37bf-a3ea-a701b918afec	5	I've seen it twice and loved it more the second time
/m/fatima_2020	01d5f6ec-5177-37bf-a3ea-a701b918afec	5	The actors and actresses were exceptional, especially, the children.  It kept to the main theme, in my opinion, pray, pray, pray. Miracles do happen.
/m/fatima_2020	01d5f6ec-5177-37bf-a3ea-a701b918afec	5	Great excellent movieeeeeeeeeeee
/m/fatima_2020	01d5f6ec-5177-37bf-a3ea-a701b918afec	5	An amazing story of bravery and courage of 3 young children fending of a new socialist government trying to shut down the Catholic church.
/m/fatima_2020	01d5f6ec-5177-37bf-a3ea-a701b918afec	5	I loved it, I would watch it again !!
/m/fatima_2020	01d5f6ec-5177-37bf-a3ea-a701b918afec	5	Everyone should see this movie. The movie was great.
/m/fatima_2020	01d5f6ec-5177-37bf-a3ea-a701b918afec	5	Best done 'religious/supernatural' movie I in many years.  Very impressive, very moving. And I'm not Catholic, tho this movie is.  I knew nothing about Fatima (NOT a comedy about a 'curvy' gal named Ima.). Takes on the event with just the right amount of questioning and skepticism. SONIA BRAGA.  & I didn't even recognize HARVEY KEITEL.   Saw 5.9.21 verifiable Orange AMC A-List.
/m/fatima_2020	01d5f6ec-5177-37bf-a3ea-a701b918afec	5	I never imagined that when COVID closed the theaters over a year ago that I would get to see this movie on the Big Screen. It was a truly different experience than watching it on a TV screen in my family room. I loved it!!!
/m/fatima_2020	01d5f6ec-5177-37bf-a3ea-a701b918afec	5	Directors brought an actual occurence 100+ years ago- alive on the screen- Loved the Einstein quote at the end- "There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.  Hope Hollywood seeks to produce modern miracle films-
/m/fatima_2020	01d5f6ec-5177-37bf-a3ea-a701b918afec	5	.Compelling and beautiful. i support more films of this kind.
/m/the_24th	1a076aa5-7aa1-330a-9426-5210fabf8d64	4	decent movie, good performances
/m/the_24th	1a076aa5-7aa1-330a-9426-5210fabf8d64	5	Know your history. Great film. Intense and will have you on the edge of your seat. Doesn’t whitewash American history.
/m/the_24th	1a076aa5-7aa1-330a-9426-5210fabf8d64	3	Where is our main character's backstory? Why should we root for him (besides the fact he is racially discriminated against)? Where did he come from? What was his life like before the Army? While The 24th is a much-needed cinematic tale, these questions are left unanswered, and the film suffers greatly because of it.
/m/the_24th	1a076aa5-7aa1-330a-9426-5210fabf8d64	5	Very authentic and very upsetting.  Acting was great.
/m/the_24th	1a076aa5-7aa1-330a-9426-5210fabf8d64	5	Truth hurts. This is a story based on true events.  Well acted. Well written. A compelling story well worth your time to see it.
/m/the_24th	1a076aa5-7aa1-330a-9426-5210fabf8d64	5	Exceptionally well-made film. Beautiful writing and imagery, and the story is certainly one worth telling. Between the placement of the American flag during a scene showing abuse of the soldiers, and the flashback to Marie on the swing set right before a painful ending, the subtle pairings of hope, misplaced faith, and raw abuse at the hands of this country, were incredibly powerful. Exceptional performances by Aja Naomi King, Trai Byers, and Cuyle Carvin left me respectively moved, heart-broken, and disturbed.
/m/the_24th	1a076aa5-7aa1-330a-9426-5210fabf8d64	3.5	Fantastic movie about a horrific event.
/m/the_24th	1a076aa5-7aa1-330a-9426-5210fabf8d64	5	What a powerful and moving story. Curious I've never heard about this tragic episode from our history. I highly recommend this powerful drama!
/m/the_24th	1a076aa5-7aa1-330a-9426-5210fabf8d64	5	I thought the acting was very real and unaffected. Scenes of cruelty and disregard by white people toward black soldiers and civilians were chilling, and cut right into my heart. I hurt inside for them, wanting to help "make the world safe for democracy" and yet without guarantee of any kind because of their color, and their parents or grandparents' former state of slavery."But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security." I quote from the Declaration of Independence. In short: no justice, no peace. Be all that as it nay: I think this film should be shown to all 7th grade U.S. History classes.
/m/the_24th	1a076aa5-7aa1-330a-9426-5210fabf8d64	5	It's a great movie showing the racism in the past and what happened and could happen today if people are of colour are oppressed. It's definitely eye opening.
/m/you_cannot_kill_david_arquette	67da1b11-e51e-39a6-bd58-3061e9f2943a	1.5	I want to dropkick whoever "sound mixed" this movie. My ears are BLEEDING
/m/you_cannot_kill_david_arquette	67da1b11-e51e-39a6-bd58-3061e9f2943a	3	Good documentary but the only annoying part is when he moping around while living in his nice big house.
/m/you_cannot_kill_david_arquette	67da1b11-e51e-39a6-bd58-3061e9f2943a	0.5	You witness David being mutilated and nearly killed in the ring, which was the most shocking, disgusting, depressing thing I have ever seen. It's not wrestling, it's just desperate and inhumane...
/m/you_cannot_kill_david_arquette	67da1b11-e51e-39a6-bd58-3061e9f2943a	5	Amazingly oddball and wonderful.
/m/you_cannot_kill_david_arquette	67da1b11-e51e-39a6-bd58-3061e9f2943a	5	David Arquette is my hero.
/m/you_cannot_kill_david_arquette	67da1b11-e51e-39a6-bd58-3061e9f2943a	2.5	A pathetic attempt at a redemption story that falls flat. Comparing Arquette to DiCaprio, del Toro, and McConaughey was disgraceful.
/m/you_cannot_kill_david_arquette	67da1b11-e51e-39a6-bd58-3061e9f2943a	4	It’s ‘about’ wrestling, but it’s also about a (very) damaged man looking for acceptance at any cost, searching for his place in the world. He just happens to be doing it through wrestling!
/m/you_cannot_kill_david_arquette	67da1b11-e51e-39a6-bd58-3061e9f2943a	3.5	This is what I like to call a fictionalized documentary or for wrestling fans a work shoot.  David Arquette says early in the doc that he been auditioning and being rejected for 10 years.  Check out his IMDB page.  He's actually quite busy.  I have mixed feelings because it's pretty clear Arquette has demons and obsessions.  He'a a very likable guy who is looking for redemption, but there's no way average Americans wouldn't want to talk to Arquette.  There's a scene that goes a little over trying to portray him as a complete loser.  It's overkill.  The second half of the film is heartwarming.   There are wrestling fans who won't watch this because the common theory is 'David Arquette killed the business' (of wrestling).  It's really uplifting even if it's filmed more like an action film.  Arquette served as an executive producer so understand going in this is a vehicle for the protagonist.  Stay through the credits, that's real!  Final Score: 7/10
/m/you_cannot_kill_david_arquette	67da1b11-e51e-39a6-bd58-3061e9f2943a	5	Like the Grizzly Man or the Tiger King, delivering next is.. the Magic Man.
/m/you_cannot_kill_david_arquette	67da1b11-e51e-39a6-bd58-3061e9f2943a	4	You Cannot Kill David Arquette is one of the maddest documentaries I have ever seen.  I know his career from a few films but like most will probably remember him best as the goofy cop from the Scream franchise.  Now I was completely unaware of this but back in 2000 David Arquette was promoting a movie he made called Ready to Rumble.  Part of this promotional tour included a set up match at WCW Wrestling.  Due to the popularity of this appearance, the writers behind WCW wrote Arquette into their wrestling shows and even had him win the WCW Championship belt.  This resulted in two things, firstly Arquette was hated by WCW fans the world over for coming in and stealing this belt from world class athletes and secondly it stalled his acting career as Hollywood no longer saw him as a viable option for casting.  This film chronicles his return to wrestling all these years later, only this time he goes for the proper training to enter as a wrestler rather than an actor in the hope of gaining the respect of the fans. I thought this was a brilliant documentary, it lifts the curtain behind the theatrics of the sport and also chronicles one man's quest to gain respect from a profession he has loved for so long and now feels he disrespected.  It's funny, it's absolutely brutal in places and surprisingly it is a truly heartfelt quest, you really do feel for the guy on his journey.  There maybe elements of this that were set up, it's difficult to know, whether they were or not, it is still one the most entertaining documentaries I have ever seen.
/m/centigrade_2020	301ded99-6f33-3206-a153-8d05b2d8faf2	3.5	Centigrade taps into the claustrophobia we've all experienced recently. A well made survival thriller with strong performances from the two leads. Knowing it is based on a true story, this'll drive you to despair.
/m/centigrade_2020	301ded99-6f33-3206-a153-8d05b2d8faf2	1	If i was trapped in a  frozen car with my pregnant wife this is how I  expect it would go.
/m/centigrade_2020	301ded99-6f33-3206-a153-8d05b2d8faf2	1.5	Who in the world would accept their predicament and simply light a candle and go to sleep? Oh right. The meek.   One more reason the meek shall never inherit the earth. The fact that this was based on a true story is all the more frustrating. I fast forwarded through the entire movie.   Listless and dull as (frozen) dishwater.
/m/centigrade_2020	301ded99-6f33-3206-a153-8d05b2d8faf2	2	First half caught my interest and had some promise however all of that disappeared with the second half and the hideous amount of screaming baby we are made to endure. On top of being boring, unimaginative and predictable, the lack of character development made me not care what happened to any of them. Waste of time.
/m/centigrade_2020	301ded99-6f33-3206-a153-8d05b2d8faf2	2.5	1 hour too long. It was a yawner.

/m/centigrade_2020	301ded99-6f33-3206-a153-8d05b2d8faf2	1.5	If they stopped arguing maybe they would actually  try to survive
/m/centigrade_2020	301ded99-6f33-3206-a153-8d05b2d8faf2	2	If Naomi didn't know where she was in the woods, she should've given the phone to Matt when she was able to get through to her dad. I know she's pregnant but she is the most selfish; wouldn't want to be stuck with her.
/m/centigrade_2020	301ded99-6f33-3206-a153-8d05b2d8faf2	0.5	Some really poor decisions on production's part.  Why focus on the dullest part of the story?!? Started slow, uninteresting, and with no depth whatsoever.  Really tawdry and mundane in how it went about, kind of 'experimental theater' feel to it...which is probably not at all how it really happened.  Another "inspired" by "real" events movie.  Horrific dialogue.  Bad acting.  The woman was an ABSOLUTE B from the very start, hard to believe anyone would stay married to someone like that, not even very believable. Horrific spoiled brat...should have been a horror, stuck in that car with her.  Also...worst survival skills EVER.
/m/one_night_in_bangkok	9da704ed-0a31-3110-b48b-8eefc746b2f1	3.5	Sounds so familiarly - Tom Cruise's Collateral, just in a different city in a different kind of cab & different kind of circumstances. It is still an enjoyable nonetheless fun ride while getting some Tom Yam Goong noodles.
/m/one_night_in_bangkok	9da704ed-0a31-3110-b48b-8eefc746b2f1	1.5	He drops into Bangkok and has 5 deadly stops to make to avenge the death of his family.
/m/one_night_in_bangkok	9da704ed-0a31-3110-b48b-8eefc746b2f1	4	I'll start by saying that these RT Critics need to stop generalizing. It makes their writing sound weak. "It leaves the audience feeling..." Speak for yourself.  What I liked about the film was the story. The twists were timed well. The story itself was original to me and made me connect with Kai. I especially liked the moral dilemma the driver was put in.  The audio in some scenes sounded unprofessional, like some self-directed cheap film on Tubi.  The acting was okay as far as the cops. The two main characters were great.    I think the backstory on the coverup should have had a little more to make me hate the family and wish they were dead. They weren't painted as over the top villains enough.
/m/one_night_in_bangkok	9da704ed-0a31-3110-b48b-8eefc746b2f1	0.5	Unbearably Life wasting bad.
/m/one_night_in_bangkok	9da704ed-0a31-3110-b48b-8eefc746b2f1	2	A not particularly well written, acted, or shot film that fails to be interesting in any meaningful way outside of some of its set-dressing. The dialogue is downright cringey. "If you're old enough to kill, you're old enough to die" is my favorite shitty action movie one-liner of 2020 though.
/m/one_night_in_bangkok	9da704ed-0a31-3110-b48b-8eefc746b2f1	4.5	Not an entirely original script but I found it engrossing.  Mark Dacascos is a great actor.
/m/one_night_in_bangkok	9da704ed-0a31-3110-b48b-8eefc746b2f1	3.5	The script is a variant of "Collateral" but the acting, production, and story-telling satisfy.  Mark Dacascos is an underrated actor.
/m/one_night_in_bangkok	9da704ed-0a31-3110-b48b-8eefc746b2f1	2.5	Mark Dacasos would be an excellent actor to play in the next hitman movie. This movie proves that. He gives a good performance in this film as well but everything around him not so much. Most of the supporting performances are pretty bad and the movie has way too much talking I was hoping for more hitman action. There’s also a few ridiculous scenes of the right character appearing at the right time. Think of it as a good performance surrounded in a rather mediocre revenge film.
/m/one_night_in_bangkok	9da704ed-0a31-3110-b48b-8eefc746b2f1	1	Punishingly terrible movie. I had to watch through to the end as some sort of self-imposed penance for deciding to watch it at all.
/m/one_night_in_bangkok	9da704ed-0a31-3110-b48b-8eefc746b2f1	0.5	This film is truly terrible. Lead actor washes his hands three times in the first 10 minutes and there's never any paper towel. He reacts. This is the pinnacle of character development. The acting? It seems like everyone remember the lines... The special effects blood and gunshots or without any technical or artistic effort. Why did I use this film as a backdrop to making potato cell salad on a Saturday afternoon? COVID-19. I love the city of Bangkok and I cannot travel. I had hoped the street scene to provide vicarious pleasure. They did not.
/m/the_pale_door	27b1471f-ef92-3903-bc62-ba027b694993	2	Dull, cheap looking and uninvolving horror Western that never settles properly into either camp.
/m/the_pale_door	27b1471f-ef92-3903-bc62-ba027b694993	2.5	A very watchable 2.6
/m/the_pale_door	27b1471f-ef92-3903-bc62-ba027b694993	1	A western/horror? Interesting premise that turns into "From Dusk Till Dawn" then just stops.  I've seen worse recently ("Goat", pointless, half a star), so "Pale Door" gets a whole star, mainly for utilizing one tree to make a forest. Nice budgeting!
/m/the_pale_door	27b1471f-ef92-3903-bc62-ba027b694993	2	😅😅the acting is really bad,production as s well, elements from dusk till dawn, but very amateurish, the idea is indeed good, and no SGI effects, kudos for that
/m/the_pale_door	27b1471f-ef92-3903-bc62-ba027b694993	2	The premise of this sounded like a great idea, western where a train robbery doesn't go as planned, and the brothers responsible along with their gang must hold up in an abandoned town occupied by witches.  Unfortunately the execution lacked any kind of compelling story.  Mind you for a horror movie, there is some impressive gore in the third act, and the witches in their true form are interestingly horrific, just wish this was better as a whole.
/m/the_pale_door	27b1471f-ef92-3903-bc62-ba027b694993	0.5	One of the worst movies I’ve ever seen.
/m/the_pale_door	27b1471f-ef92-3903-bc62-ba027b694993	1	I got through maybe 10 minutes and could no longer take the terrible acting. The gunfight scene in the street was laughable. I wish there were negative stars. DO NOT WATCH.
/m/the_pale_door	27b1471f-ef92-3903-bc62-ba027b694993	2	Su historia es simploncilla, pero podria funcionar, sobretodo porque tiene un reparto que está bastante bien para el nivel de la película. Lástima que el diseño de producción sea un completo desastre. Entiendo que hacer una película realista en el oeste americano no debe de ser muy barato, pero si los spaguetti western conseguían casi hacerlo en los 60s y 70s...   Al final lo que queda es un subproducto que podria haber estado muchísimo mejor, sobretodo a nivel visual...
/m/the_pale_door	27b1471f-ef92-3903-bc62-ba027b694993	2	Straight off the bat I found that this film lacked something. Although I was pleasantly surprised about it being a Western, a Western style horror, that's definitely a new concept to me; or perhaps I am just uncultured. So I will definitely give it that on terms of uniqueness.  I think this film had a lot of potential but it's only got there by the tip of a finger.   My first though was what the hell is happening right now? Who are they? Why are they there? The beginning of the film you see a small boy in his bed, scared of the thunder and lightening which is normal, so not far fetched, not a trope. His big brother comforts him and promises 'big brother magic' with a small bandana wrapped around the boys neck for protection given to him by his sibling. We then hear horses hooves and suddenly the dad bursts through the door and says 'they're here'. The sad thing is, we never find out who 'they' are and why 'they' are there other than the parents who were one shot killed at the end of this scene. No explanation, just.. here today gone tonight. C'est la vie.  I won't ruin the rest of the story for you but what I will say is that the film was just far too predictable bordering on cringe to be fair. There was no sense of unique design to the burned witches, it reminded me an awful lot of the witches in the adaptation of Roald Dahls book, 'The Witches' that burned, crusty, pointy nose cliché. Perhaps it was to be slapstick, pehaps it's a film that has the intention of being so bad that its somehow unexplainably good? But its a no from me.   I just find that the storyline was just too simple. Up until they found the girl in the box it was seriously interesting but after that it just fell apart like a ice cream you were too busy gawping to notice it melting away and falling splat on the floor.   However there was some good points, for example Devin Druid from '13 Reason's Why' played the main part of Jake, now that was sort of a hook for me as he has this sort of original dweeb look that's really rather compelling and it works for him. He plays the innocent, socially awkward teen really well, but we all age over time so it will definitely be interesting to see where his career takes him. He, as far as i'm concerned alongside Stan Shaw and Zachary Knighton was this films only saving grace.   There is so much left unexplained in this film that it's almost like ordering a pizza, waiting on it arriving and finding that it has the toppings you asked for but not the cheese. or the stuffed crust. (this has actually happened to me before, no lie) you spend your time disappointed and angry that you waited all that time for the whole package and all you got was a slimy pepperoni and you sit there confused as to why some of the most important ingredients are missing.   Overall I can say this film was 96 minutes of my life i'm not getting back and that's a waste.
/m/the_pale_door	27b1471f-ef92-3903-bc62-ba027b694993	1	idk; i couldn't finish it. didn't hold my attention at all - i couldn't even tell you what happened during the part that i did watch. but the audience reviews aren't bad... may or may not try to watch this again at a later date.
/m/the_honeymoon_phase	e568843c-28c7-3527-ab70-5a14351cee21	1.5	Very slow paced not much of a thriller version of living with you or multiplicity.
/m/the_honeymoon_phase	e568843c-28c7-3527-ab70-5a14351cee21	3	Really good. Really really falls apart. Hated the ending.
/m/the_honeymoon_phase	e568843c-28c7-3527-ab70-5a14351cee21	4	This one was good. Interesting and entertaining with a good storyline. The only critique I would give is the ending but def worth the watch.
/m/the_honeymoon_phase	e568843c-28c7-3527-ab70-5a14351cee21	0.5	Antifeminist, frustratingly slow, badly written, predictable.
/m/the_honeymoon_phase	e568843c-28c7-3527-ab70-5a14351cee21	3	3 out of 5 stars. The Honeymoon Phase is a fair science fiction thriller film. About a newly wed couple going into an experiment trial. As the company observes how the couple are reacting towards each other for a month. They are given a house. Food. Furniture and supplies. Until the wife starts questioning if her husband is lying to her. Interesting concept and plot. Could have been so much more. The script does fall apart by the time it reaches its third act. The writer feels like they ran out of ideas on where to go. When the twist is revealed which is surprising. But it falls so quick that it ruined the whole movie. Especially the ending. The cast did decent with there performances. The direction was okay. The script and ending kind of wasted a good idea to having an uninspired shocking ending.
/m/the_honeymoon_phase	e568843c-28c7-3527-ab70-5a14351cee21	5	The director of this movie really knows how to keep you on your toes. The actors are extremely well versed in their roles. The subject matter is not the same old horror movie genre glorified. This movie is a must see The originality of this movie and the pace makes the movie quite a pleasure to watch
/m/the_honeymoon_phase	e568843c-28c7-3527-ab70-5a14351cee21	5	Really good film from a skilled cast and crew!
/m/the_honeymoon_phase	e568843c-28c7-3527-ab70-5a14351cee21	5	What a terrific discovery. I think this is the one of the better films I've seen this year; it's thoughtful, tense, spooky and I'm glad I bought it instead of just renting it. My gut was telling me something and thankfully my gut was right!
/m/the_honeymoon_phase	e568843c-28c7-3527-ab70-5a14351cee21	4	A great psychological thriller that dives into the gritty problems of trust in a relationship. Clean, easy-to-follow cinematography and editing along with a memorable film score makes this a fast paced enjoyable viewing. This film differentiate itself with others with a sci-fi element that leads to a few surprises at the end and some shocking scenes.
/m/the_honeymoon_phase	e568843c-28c7-3527-ab70-5a14351cee21	5	If you like Black Mirror you'll love The Honeymoon Phase. Kept me guessing the entire time. Performances were really good, especially Jim Schubin and Chloe Carroll. Also really loved the musical score. Overall, if you're into indie thrillers, I'd recommend checking this one out. Ending will probably be divisive, but I thought the twist payoff was really good.
/m/rogue_2020	d01d32f3-d187-377b-bc4f-57a010b756d6	2	Good action and, despite hoaky writing, well crafted tension. All this is destroyed by terrible cgi and a ridiculous ending. Plus some moments of intense stupidity but those I could forgive.
/m/rogue_2020	d01d32f3-d187-377b-bc4f-57a010b756d6	1.5	Don't bother. Megan Fox didn't come across as appropriate for the character/role. Production quality was lacking.  The pathetic CGI lioness epitomized that.
/m/rogue_2020	d01d32f3-d187-377b-bc4f-57a010b756d6	2.5	This action movie was alright. Megan Fox, Philip Winchester, Cassi Colvin, Jessica Sutton, and the rest of the cast did a decent job in this movie. The plot of the movie was a little intense, action-packed, and kind of thrilling. It wasn't as great as I'd thought it would be. If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't waste your time. You won't like it very much.
/m/rogue_2020	d01d32f3-d187-377b-bc4f-57a010b756d6	2	The characters, acting, and dialogue were perfectly (and surprisingly) acceptable. The plot was very contrived and didn't flow well, a lot of things happened purely to push the story forward. Sadly, this is another film where they played counter-strike instead of hiring a technical advisor. If 80% of your film is going to be military style battle and tactics, know what those look like before you film them.  The average viewer knows you don't drive a car from the back seat, that is why you don't generally see that in movies. I know that 18 guage corrugated sheet metal doesn't stop 7.62. I shouldn't see that in this movie.  The special effects are right out of 1992, and it seems like they rewrote the ending last minute after test audiences didn't like the first one.
/m/rogue_2020	d01d32f3-d187-377b-bc4f-57a010b756d6	2	Megan Fox goes against one of the ultimate predators Mother Nature has to offer  She plays mercenary Samantha O' Hara leading a team of soldiers in the African Serengeti desert  Their latest mission is to save sex trafficking hostages in a remote area  They succeed but unbeknownst to them poachers have been attacked by a rogue lioness on a farm  Now the giant beast is on the loose killing everything in sight  Samantha and her team now have to face a blood-hungry killing machine while awaiting for the rescue team  Some animals go rogue and only kill  This was just alright; not too many scenes of the animal maulings and sinks into some uninteresting melodrama  There's good blood and gun fights but none of the chills or suspense of animal-bottle flicks like 'Crawl' or 'Jaws' Some of the lion effects leave a lot to be desired too
/m/rogue_2020	d01d32f3-d187-377b-bc4f-57a010b756d6	5	Very fun movie. Sometimes making an entertaining movie is enough. It doesn't always have to be some huge plot or "make you think" good old fashioned entertainment that I enjoyed! :)
/m/rogue_2020	d01d32f3-d187-377b-bc4f-57a010b756d6	0.5	This movie is full bull crap not lions people getting chewed up and just walking around like nothing and Magen F can’t act at all 👎👎
/m/rogue_2020	d01d32f3-d187-377b-bc4f-57a010b756d6	1	bad plot and acting.
/m/rogue_2020	d01d32f3-d187-377b-bc4f-57a010b756d6	1	Didn't enjoy at all...Good idea just too cheaply executed for me
/m/rogue_2020	d01d32f3-d187-377b-bc4f-57a010b756d6	1	Megan fox doesn t know how to act... and playing a soldier is even worse.
/m/the_vanished_2020	df400edd-6964-4fb2-ac37-933e78efe772	3.5	There's a facetious feel to "The Vanished," like the filmmaker has a trick up his sleeve and he's chuckling about it. But there's nothing funny about the subject matter. A married couple, Paul and Wendy (Thomas Jane and Anne Heche) are vacationing with their young daughter Taylor at a remote RV lakeside campground in Alabama. They're in one of those enormous RV's that send environmentalists into conniptions. After they get unpacked, Wendy goes to the camp store to pay the rent, and Paul gets gear ready to take Taylor fishing. He is distracted by a gorgeous woman in a bikini (Aleksei Archer), who is camping in an adjacent RV with her husband. When Wendy returns minutes later, Taylor has disappeared.  Paul and Wendy call the cops, and a helpful sheriff shows up (Jason Patric). Shortly thereafter, there are teams of deputies and volunteers scouring the woods. Just to complicate things, there is an escaped convict on the run in the area, but to elaborate on that would involve spoilers. Suspects include Miranda and her husband, the grumpy owner of the campground, and a weird, young, meth head employee who rides around in an ATV frowning at everybody. Suffice it to say, red herrings are abundant. Jane and Heche are competent, but Patric's performance is the most impressive. He's avuncular and reassuring, telling the couple that in 32 years, he has never failed to find a missing kid. But due to the film's atmosphere of paranoia, we're not entirely sure if he's trustworthy.  Just to add to the angst, the sheriff has a drinking problem and a tragedy in his past, and Wendy reveals that Paul has had some sexual fidelity problems. She blames him for ogling Miranda when Taylor disappeared.  Plus, there are eventually four dead bodies (one of which is not human---sorry, dog lovers) and another missing person.  The story is so packed with distractions that I suspected I was being set up for a twist. Boy, did I get that right. You may be gobsmacked because you didn't see it coming. Or, like myself, you may guess it in the final act. If you're especially savvy, you may suspect it all along—in which case, good for you. The movie doesn't cheat, and there's an expository sequence after the reveal that answers your questions. Too bad about the dog. But I never liked pugs anyway.
/m/the_vanished_2020	df400edd-6964-4fb2-ac37-933e78efe772	3.5	Enjoyable story. The twist ending was disappointing, but pretty good overall.
/m/the_vanished_2020	df400edd-6964-4fb2-ac37-933e78efe772	4	An extremely intelligent and well directed movie with Anne Heche at her very best. The tension rises continuously and takes you to a finale which is beyond anything you could have imagined. I bet the story gonna stay in your head for days to come. One of the best suspense movies of the last 5 years. 8/10 points.
/m/the_vanished_2020	df400edd-6964-4fb2-ac37-933e78efe772	1	Awful acting, really bad. Waste of time
/m/the_vanished_2020	df400edd-6964-4fb2-ac37-933e78efe772	0.5	oh boy, this was bad
/m/the_vanished_2020	df400edd-6964-4fb2-ac37-933e78efe772	5	This movie was great had me at the edge of my seat the whole time and then the ending ur like what the I did not see that coming it's a must see !!!!
/m/the_vanished_2020	df400edd-6964-4fb2-ac37-933e78efe772	5	Absolute every perants worst nightmare..  Brilliant film 🤘💯
/m/the_vanished_2020	df400edd-6964-4fb2-ac37-933e78efe772	1	One absurdity piled on top of another.
/m/the_vanished_2020	df400edd-6964-4fb2-ac37-933e78efe772	3.5	I don't know why this film isn't talked about more...it has a great twist ending and is very interesting and suspenseful throughout! I liked it.
/m/the_vanished_2020	df400edd-6964-4fb2-ac37-933e78efe772	3	The Vanished is a decent film, with problems in it. A decent thriller with a decent twist at the end.
/m/hard_kill	4ef1ccab-a5f6-4ce2-ad13-5678b86a8ec5	0.5	My son told me that Rotten Tomatoes rigs the ratings.  I didn't think that it was possible.  It is.  This movie is listed as 61% audience reviews.  If you go through all the ratings, they are more than 80% 1/2 or 1 star.  How exactly does that equal 61%?  To say this movie was awful, just really doesn't give it justice.  Somebody said in one of the other reviews, it looked like the actors read their lines from a teleprompter.  That is about right.  Bruce, I know you need a paycheck every now and then, but please don't stoop this low.  I found there were no redeeming qualities to the movie.  Is there any way to give a negative score to this movie?  That was 40 minutes of my life I will never get back.
/m/hard_kill	4ef1ccab-a5f6-4ce2-ad13-5678b86a8ec5	0.5	Just sooooo bad.  The acting is so bad that sometimes it looks like the actors are actually reading their lines from teleprompters.  Maybe they were???  Plot holes...not much of a plot to begin with.  Bruce Willis just looks really old and annoyed.  I couldn't take it anymore and turned it off half way through.  It was obvious what was going to happen anyway.
/m/hard_kill	4ef1ccab-a5f6-4ce2-ad13-5678b86a8ec5	0.5	- some of the lines are just cliche and not relevant to the situation in any way - they could afford Bruse Willis but apparently, they couldn't afford a tripod, based on how much the camera shakes - the direction is meh - the acting is terrible - zero connection to the characters - the whole movie is just action and not good action like in john wick  - most of the movie is just apes shooting each other for like an hour straight without any real plot points - the enemies have cat-like reaction times... that is if the cat was run over by a truck  - the writer seriously need to rethink his career   overall the action in this movie is very unimpressive for an action movie witch ain't good considering that's all the movie has (literally nothing else happens). the name of the movie is a good indicator of the intelligence of the people who made it. this might just be one of the worst movies I have ever seen second only to The Hulk 2003 *gagging noises*.
/m/hard_kill	4ef1ccab-a5f6-4ce2-ad13-5678b86a8ec5	1.5	Pretty pathetic. Wooden acting, weak plot.
/m/hard_kill	4ef1ccab-a5f6-4ce2-ad13-5678b86a8ec5	2	From the moment I saw that ridiculously long Cadillac limousine that shouldn't be see anywhere but in Vegas on a hens night or taking dumb kids to their prom, I knew this was gonna be a bad movie. Bruce Willis needs to stop doing these movies before he completely becomes Steven Seagal. And this movie's villain's goal is exactly the same as Die Hard 4.0: Live Free or Die Hard's Timothy Olyphant. You did this movie already, Bruce!
/m/hard_kill	4ef1ccab-a5f6-4ce2-ad13-5678b86a8ec5	0.5	Bruce Willis must have a cheap day rate because he is in a lot of movies for 10-15 min with only one outfit change. Anyway this POS is one running action cliche with no real characters or plot or guns that have been in use for 30 years. Straight to video is too generous a characterization for this flick.
/m/hard_kill	4ef1ccab-a5f6-4ce2-ad13-5678b86a8ec5	0.5	If you want to waste your time watch this, and how tf does this movie has 62% audience???
/m/hard_kill	4ef1ccab-a5f6-4ce2-ad13-5678b86a8ec5	0.5	The plot is very mediocre and it's all down hill from there. The screenplay is from a really bad high school play. The acting in a few cases makes it even worse. If you have absolutely nothing else to do or you can't sleep then you still shouldn't watch this. Seriously find another film to watch. The chances of it being worse than this are slim to none.
/m/hard_kill	4ef1ccab-a5f6-4ce2-ad13-5678b86a8ec5	0.5	I hope Bruce made a decent paycheck. I mean, he didn't really deserve it, but at least this would all make some sense.
/m/hard_kill	4ef1ccab-a5f6-4ce2-ad13-5678b86a8ec5	0.5	Horrible. Terrible Villain. Poor script. Soldiers resisting lot of fire behind cardboard boxes. no one takes cover under heavy fire, and when they do, they chose wood tables as shield. OMG, 1,5 hours lost
/m/driven_to_abstraction	5be1e92f-87ba-3f0a-ab65-99c2fd179850	5	Fascinating story presented in an illuminating way. Definitely worth watching.
/m/driven_to_abstraction	5be1e92f-87ba-3f0a-ab65-99c2fd179850	5	Fascinating look into one of the great art scandals of our times!  "Driven To Abstraction" presents an intriguing story with interesting characters which moves quickly to reveal the events that brought about the downfall of one of New York's most prestigious art galleries.  Highly recommended!
/m/driven_to_abstraction	5be1e92f-87ba-3f0a-ab65-99c2fd179850	5	An entertaining and informative ride through the twists and turns of the art world and how forgeries get sold.
/m/driven_to_abstraction	5be1e92f-87ba-3f0a-ab65-99c2fd179850	4	A fascinating and thorough telling of an amazing story of fraud and deception in the art world that spanned decades and fooled experts and buyers alike.  Well told with a wealth of interviews from art world insiders.  Highly recommend.
/m/random_acts_of_violence_2020	728afc01-d9a7-3593-a2f2-4f08670779dc	3	i actually quite liked this one - the premise was clever & very well done. but the ending leaves a lot to be desired; i like what they were trying to achieve with it, but something felt off... idk. it was pretty un-satisfactory. but I'm not mad i watched it. i'd watch it again even.
/m/random_acts_of_violence_2020	728afc01-d9a7-3593-a2f2-4f08670779dc	3	With a few dazzling visual ideas and a sense of enjoyable gory fun the movie offers something to appreciate if not that original. There is a sense of rhythm and editing and the cast is all in the possible crazyness of the enterprise but it lacks something really new to make a statement.
/m/random_acts_of_violence_2020	728afc01-d9a7-3593-a2f2-4f08670779dc	1.5	This actually looked fun and started out fun, but it needs to start explaining its whole story about an hour into this hour and 20 minute movie that it sucks all fun and nonsense that it should have out. The third act just sucks and ruins the whole movie.
/m/random_acts_of_violence_2020	728afc01-d9a7-3593-a2f2-4f08670779dc	2.5	Jay Baruchel se estrena de forma muy interesante como director y guionista (al mismo tiempo) con este curioso Slasher que maneja ideas MUY interesantes pero que por desgracia hacia el final de este se siente algo pretencioso e insustancial.  Aun asi es bastante brutal como su nombre indica, lo cual también mola.
/m/random_acts_of_violence_2020	728afc01-d9a7-3593-a2f2-4f08670779dc	4	Solid little stylistic slasher flick about the fetishization of serial killers. The twist is highly implausible, but it doesn't matter because it's interesting and well done.
/m/random_acts_of_violence_2020	728afc01-d9a7-3593-a2f2-4f08670779dc	3	BOO  Oh what coulda been. But then again, final acts in the serial killer horror genre rarely deliver on any promises made. Most just get messy.  And yes, "Random Acts of Violence" gets messy. Not for the weak of heart, this slasher builds on the premise of a copy cat killer aping the debauchery of a gruesome comic book. The author (and friends) gets caught up in the mayhem, which poses the age old question of life imitating art, except there is another art thrown in to suggest a loop.  Best known for his comedic Hollywood turns, Jay Baruchel writes, directs and co-stars in what is obviously a labour of love pet project. From the flippant opening that creates an illusion of comfort, to the harsh transition to the horrific - don't go in there - gore sequences, the set up and execution is classic shock.  Instead of challenged teenagers doing stupid things, our group of victims (sorry) not only react accordingly, but also try and dissect the situation, and the consequences of their actions. But then, well, things go off the rails.  Baruchel is clearly a studious fan of the genre, but like many before him, gets carried away, and cannot properly wrap his story in a satisfying manner. Maybe next time.  - hipCRANK
/m/random_acts_of_violence_2020	728afc01-d9a7-3593-a2f2-4f08670779dc	2	It is far too self important for this kind of film. It isn't clever, insitful or interesting, just disgusting for disgusting sake.
/m/random_acts_of_violence_2020	728afc01-d9a7-3593-a2f2-4f08670779dc	0.5	Awful movie, awful script, awful direction, photography and editing. The performances are HIDEOUS. They scream the entire movie, even the extras scream. It's absolutely irritating. I had to stop it in the middle 'cause couldn't hold out another minute. Don't waste your time on this garbage.
/m/random_acts_of_violence_2020	728afc01-d9a7-3593-a2f2-4f08670779dc	4	Really enjoyed this one. I've been craving a slasher and this definitely hit the mark. Its brutal and bloody which is something most horror these days tends to shy away from unfortunately. Thank God for Shudder.
/m/random_acts_of_violence_2020	728afc01-d9a7-3593-a2f2-4f08670779dc	3.5	While not as good as his previous effort as a director 'Goon Last of the Enforcers', nonetheless I enjoyed Jay Baruchel's gory adaption of 'Random Acts of Violence'. My review: https://youtu.be/HqxbNYaCb5A
/m/unfit_the_psychology_of_donald_trump	08c38d6c-dba6-4b34-95f1-637b83dfa023	0.5	umm.... what? I felt like this movie was less about him and his life and decisions to influence our world, and more about telling everyone he's a psycho. I want to see what MADE him like this, not just that he is.
/m/unfit_the_psychology_of_donald_trump	08c38d6c-dba6-4b34-95f1-637b83dfa023	0.5	Exactly how I expected it to be. An exercise in fear-mongering, gaslighting, mis-information, and hypocrisy.
/m/unfit_the_psychology_of_donald_trump	08c38d6c-dba6-4b34-95f1-637b83dfa023	2	the move is so so.. they have a few good points and expose problems in the trump administration.. What is Sad is you will never see any one do this to the corrupted Biden administration when it comes to movies like this you will never see them criticizing the democratic party.
/m/unfit_the_psychology_of_donald_trump	08c38d6c-dba6-4b34-95f1-637b83dfa023	4	As I suspected. I tend to agree. But no hate here. He can't help it if he's unfit, and possibly getting a little senile as well.  I wish him a happy, healthy, and relaxing retirement. Keep on golfing!
/m/unfit_the_psychology_of_donald_trump	08c38d6c-dba6-4b34-95f1-637b83dfa023	4	Obvious must watch right before the election. Yes, everything presented here is further proof that the current occupant of the White House is a dangerous vile, horrible piece of human filth and should have never been in power in the first place. What I take from this is the reasons why we got to this point and what the outcome could be if we don't stand up to this evil regime and vote. Vote him out, we must. Excellent documentary.
/m/unfit_the_psychology_of_donald_trump	08c38d6c-dba6-4b34-95f1-637b83dfa023	5	Anything that goes against this Nazi in the Whitehouse is something I love
/m/unfit_the_psychology_of_donald_trump	08c38d6c-dba6-4b34-95f1-637b83dfa023	2.5	While I can't stand Trump and would never vote for him, I watched this movie as a pro Trumper would. I think they could have done a better job at showing multiple instances of Trump in his own words, reaping praise of new hires he brought into the administration then later disparaging them because they disagreed with him. The number of people he fired says a lot about his dictator tendencies. They should have shown how he mocks people- not for what they did or didn't do, but merely on just how they look. They should have shown him stating some lie over and over again- then later, caling it fake news; even after he advises his followers to disbelieve anything they read or hear. He is a cult leader who preys on the disadvantaged from those clinging on to the hope that someone other than a ‘suit' who sounds good, fails to deliver on promises. A clearer demonstration of how he lies and tries to pull the wool over so many eyes was lacking to fulfill the ideal objective of persuading loyal Trump cult members to mentally disengage from their fearless leader.
/m/unfit_the_psychology_of_donald_trump	08c38d6c-dba6-4b34-95f1-637b83dfa023	0.5	Oh how partisan this movie is. I was hoping for an informative documentary. Just another hit job. Which explains who is elevating the rating. Poorky made, edited, executed with a tired sountrack. Dont waste your time or $$ on it.
/m/unfit_the_psychology_of_donald_trump	08c38d6c-dba6-4b34-95f1-637b83dfa023	0.5	This movie was just stupid. Lacked facts and was more like click bait. We all hate the man but please can you do better?
/m/unfit_the_psychology_of_donald_trump	08c38d6c-dba6-4b34-95f1-637b83dfa023	5	How did 60 Minutes miss this?
/m/immortal_2020	b62eb6db-389a-45a7-904f-7d65cfeb2605	5	Not your traditional horror movie, but I highly recommend watching this! Most anthology horror/thriller movies are loaded with quick thrills and jump scares and although Immortal doesn't subscribe to these attention grabbers, it will still pull you in to each and every story and subject you to the emotional toils of the characters.
/m/immortal_2020	b62eb6db-389a-45a7-904f-7d65cfeb2605	0.5	It was awful. After one character learns they are immortal, it ends their chapter and starts a new one. I thought there would be follow up on their life after they learn they are immortal, but it does not.   DO NOT WATCH.
/m/immortal_2020	b62eb6db-389a-45a7-904f-7d65cfeb2605	0.5	Waste of time. No ending. Bunch of short stories of people that won’t die. None of the stories connect. Don’t even bother.
