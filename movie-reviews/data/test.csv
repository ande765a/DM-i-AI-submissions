Great movie you should make a 3rd one!!!ð'?
Beautiful movie and the performance by Andrew Garfield was excellent 
The greatest lie ever told that vaccines are safe and effective!!
Welcome to Good Burger home of The Good Burger, can I take your order?   I'm a 90's Nickelodeon Kid! Parents if you grew up in the '90s and haven't shown your kids this.... Then what are you waiting for? Fun for all ages.
This was not an Oscar type film.  It was not my usual fare.  Claudia Harrison made it for me.  A movie about oyster farmers was truly offbeat.  I did not understand most of the dialog due to the accents.  Nevertheless, I stayed entranced because of Claudia.  She should definitely be in more movies.
Got to see this early on October 1st, and I couldn't say no to the offer, being a fan of the book series. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I feel like this movie mad Diary Of A Wimpy Kid feel a bit more wimpier.
I think this film is TERRIFYING and BRILLIANT. So scary I don't want to watch it again. Scares and upsets me that much. Maybe watch it again with a friend...as long as they stay the night!
What a WAKE UP call!!
Very entertaining. Great story. Good acting.
Affecting and powerful. All about relationships, identity and persistence.
Excellently produced documentary about a whistleblower.. MUST WATCH!!
Incredible film!  Skylan Brooks and Ethan Dizon are great actors, watch their stars rise in the coming years.
An electrifying performance from Denzel Washington.  The film is deep, searching the humanities qualities of good, realising that sometimes we all lean with the rest of sheep rather standing up for what we believe in.  This film isn't for those who want bubble gum or some one with an S on there chest and cape.  This is film with really deep scope, showing we can go to the bottom in life not by own choices but by those around us, the lost individuals.  If you make a choice , can you actually redeem yourself.  There is only one answer yes and this film shows that.   There many in the world that really need to look at this film for golden worth it is and listen to the words spoken , what the writer is trying to tell you.  Life is good, life is unfair at times.  But the goodness one individual can affect us even were bad may get the upper hand
A wonderful and very enjoyable movie, great acting, funny and moving. A diverse group of characters in a modern dysfunctional world.
Good classic horror movie. A fun contribution to the genre.
Nice && inspirational  Farhan Akthar is awesome !!
I really liked it :)
heee thats cool movie :P
favourite comfort romantic film
This is one of my guilty pleasure movies. It is so dumb but it never fails to make me laugh.
I love how they did such a great and fun movie with a cliché and queer romance. This is my favorite movie of all times.
great movie showing the spirit of a woman that could not be defeated no matter what what was thrown at her.  Great acting by those portraying her at various stages of her life.
Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg do a good job and daddy”s home it’s such a funny movie when I saw it I was laughing a lot! My favorite part was a motorcycle incident
Amazing tear jerker!
Everything about this movie is out of left field in the best possible way. It shows the essential elements of what it means to be alive and experience emotions by breaking them down into manageable ideas that a dead dude with a lot of farts could understand.
It was so cute! There's no flawed storyline, like uncreative critics would have you believe. There's no unbelievable "bad guy," like every other movie. Just logical actions and interesting consequences. I loved it.
I found watching this movie akin to meditating for 90 mins: calming and also invigorating. Possibly my favourite movie ever.
Saddest film I’ve ever seen. You’ll feel the deepest emotions you never knew watching a film could give you. You’ll see captive animals in a whole new light. No film or documentary will ever touch you as much as this one. I never felt that way watching anything and there’s no way another one will ever compare to how this film made me feel. 
This was amazing movie
Refreshing and thrilling. Strongly recommend!
Absolutely gut-wrenching. Took a day for me to recover.
My 8 year old and I loved it!
If you want to awaken to some real truths and the holocaust that is being perpetrated on our babies and our children I highly recommend watching this film. The MMR vaccines and many other vaccines are filled with neurotoxins and very few that know this truth have the courage to speak out. I commend the bravery to anybody that speaks out explains one of the reasons why our generation of kids are brain injured and labeled as autistic
Scared the Bu-gee-bus outta me , great film 
Is that a Jojo refference?
Excellent!   What a masterpiece of truth about vaccines - everyone in the world should see this very well done film!  Vaxxed explains so much in such an easy to understand manner!  Kudos to the Vaxxed team!
bout to watch this for the 10 millionth time...never gets old! thanks family video
A great Christmas movie!
One if the most well written and acted film of this genre to be made this year. Incredible film. 
Badass spaghetti flick, really underrated!
I really enjoyed this film. A story about a young black guy who is caught up in some shady dealings while trying to support himself and his minor sister (after the death of mom) yet it depicts all of these things in a tasteful manner. Loved the fact that the story line was not overshadowed by derogatory language, sex or the misconception that drugs are somehow cool. 5 stars from this Christian mama.
Super fun movie for kids. I really enjoyed it too.
Having read the reviews I must be the only person who thoroughly enjoyed this film.  It was incredibly moving and the final twist got me at the end. Just as life was working out for them it was cruelly snatched away from them.  Absolutely loved this film
simple in appearance, but deeply layered.. Highly provocative.
Oh, what a marvellous re-make! So subtle and full of fresh insight.
brilliant. just when you think things cant get worse, they do.
The best film of 2016.
Me encantó, te mantiene entretenido todo el tiempo, la historia es muy buena, la premisa, el final, los efectos, las actuaciones, todo.  Te hace pensar que harías tú en su lugar y cómo sería vivir una situación así. Muy buena, muy recomendable.
Wasn't playing in my town so I had to drove to another town to see it. Was worth it! Rock n' Roll music and dealings with the devil.....great movie!!
A great movie based on computer graphics that are sophisticated and detailed. I was spotting characters from other movies, video games and demo scene throughout the film. Do not and bad reviews prevent you from watching this movie. It is a great film for #movienight
i love this movie.....
This movie deserves more credit than it got. The entire point of the movie was to be a generic rom-com, and it provided something substantial for many across the country and world-wide. To say that this movie was 'lacking' something is essentially indicating you would rather have had it be a story between a man and a woman, as if that would make the story any more important. DISGUSTAN.
Awesome movie! A lot of fun!!
This is one of a handful of feel good movies, along with Zoolander and Happy Gilmore, that I never get tired of. It still makes me laugh out loud. A heartwarming storyline, great cast and characters, solid acting, this movie is the full package. If you are unable to appreciate a variety of pleasures in life, like the critics who panned this, then don't waste your time but if you like to decompress occasionally from your high-stress job or family, restore your faith in humanity and laugh for a couple of hours, check this out. That's who this movie's targeted audience is. Sure, I think Alfred Hitchcock and Martin Scorcese are brilliant but a sweet juicy watermelon and salmon carpaccio are equally delicious.
amazing film, about the brutal lives and lifestyles of the Polynesian warriors
The only thing more disturbing than The Eyes of My Mother is the fact that no one's talking about it.
Excellent movie!!!! I would recommend it to my friends and family.
Excellent movie exposing the fraud within the CDC and pharmaceutical industry.
Hands of Stone is writer and director Jonathan Jakubowicz's quixotic project of bringing the life of Roberto Durán to the big screen. Unless you are over fifty years old, a scholar of boxing history, or a Panamanian like me, chances are you won't know who Roberto Durán is, and you may assume that this movie is not for you. Actually, if you do know who Durán is, unless you are a Panamanian, chances are that what you know about the man will be mostly about an infamous decision he took 36 years ago, one that haunts him to this day and has come to define his career as seen by foreign eyes. But it would be a mistake to assume that you know the real story of Roberto Durán, or to dismiss this movie as something that would not interest you. Because Durán's life is a deeply human story of grit in the face of adversity, of courage and betrayal, and - above all - it is a story of redemption.  So, who is the guy? Roberto Durán, a national hero in my native Panama, is widely regarded as one of the greatest boxers ever. When he and American boxing legend Sugar Ray Leonard fought for the first time on June 20, 1980, in Montreal, Durán had an astounding record: a single loss in seventy fights, most of them won by knock-out. Leonard, an Olympic gold medalist, was undefeated and considered the favorite to win the fight. Their clash was a brutal affair, which Leonard described (using Ali's phrase) as coming closer to death than he ever had before. Leonard fought valiantly to the bitter end, but Durán proved superior and won fairly by decision of the judges. A rematch was scheduled for November 25, 1980, in New Orleans. Near the end of the eighth round of this second fight, Roberto Durán - the most macho of all fighters, the man with the hands of stone - quit, cold turkey, out of the blue. The boxing world was in shock. Quitting during a fight is a cardinal sin against the spirit of boxing. That this sin was committed by Roberto Durán, one of the fiercest, most brutal boxers ever, during one of the most important fights of his career, made it even harder to believe.  And it is precisely on this account that Jakubowicz's Hands of Stone should be seen as a great success: it manages to explain the inexplicable and to restore the luster to a temporarily tarnished icon. Through an accurate depiction of Durán and his personal history in Panama, the film renders the man transparent to foreign eyes, and dissipates the seeming mystery behind Durán's fatidic decision.  Even though it features a couple of big names in the cast, the film has the feeling of an indie production, albeit a very good one. Many of the scenes were shot in real locations where Roberto Durán grew up, including the poor neighborhood of El Chorrillo. Dramatic historical scenes were recreated, in a largely factual manner, against the backdrop of real places. For example, the Administration Building of the Panama Canal Administration was used in a recreation of the tragic events of January 9, 1964, when Panamanian students and American citizens stationed in the Canal Zone clashed over the right to fly the Panamanian flag in designated places. Some inaccurate details will catch the eye of more knowledgeable viewers. For example, during some scenes shot in the Panama Canal locks of Miraflores, the recent expansion work can be seen in the background, decades before it started. In a panoramic view in another scene, the foundations of the Bridge of the Americas are shown as they look today, not as they did decades ago (even though the bridge itself is CGI'd to look as it did during Durán's childhood).  Robert De Niro, the biggest name in the cast, plays the legendary trainer Ray Arcel, who led Durán to the world championship, and serves as a backbone to the narrative of the movie. Rising star Edgar Ramírez (Carlos, The Liberator) plays the man himself, Roberto Durán. The role required from Ramírez intense training in boxing and language. His rendering of Panamanian speech patterns is right on the money, as is his channeling of Duran's inner animal, curse words and all. The breathtaking Ana de Armas, a relatively unknown actress of Cuban origin who is currently filming Blade Runner 2, plays Durán's wife, Felicidad Iglesias, and also comes across as a very convincing Panamanian girl. Salsa music legend Ruben Blades (who also contributed to the film's soundtrack) plays Carlos Eleta, Durán's manager, enabler and - later - his unwilling Judas. A very buffed Usher Raymond brings to life the suave yet ferocious Sugar Ray Leonard. Usher was trained by Leonard himself for the role. And Óscar Jaenada, who was magnificent in Cantinflas, plays here another eccentric character to perfection: Chaflan, Durán's childhood mentor.  I was pleased with the respectful treatment that Hands of Stone gives to historical fact concerning not only Durán's life but also the history of his country, my country. It shows Durán as he was: not a thinker, not a gentleman, but a merciless fighter. Very sensitive topics are dealt with in an accurate manner. However, what pleased me even more was to see a film that finally has the courage to show the complex reason behind Durán's sudden decision to quit: it is a very deep and personal reason, not easily brought to the surface. Hands of Stone explores the astonishing outcome of Durán vs. Leonard II, without relying (like ESPN's documentary No Más did, shamelessly) on the mumbling words - overflowing with excuses - of an older, ashamed Durán trying to explain himself. Instead, it looks at the facts. It dissects the life of a young Durán in the streets of El Chorrillo, at a time when his country felt oppressed (with good reason) by the unfair treatment it had received from the United States regarding the Canal. It shows how Durán rose to prominence as a ferocious fighter, his personal shame and pride, and his sense of self. It unveils the private interests of those surrounding him and managing his career, and the chain of events that led to his rushed and ill-conceived rematch against Leonard. It reveals the man's inner struggles against the background of his circumstances. By the end of the film, the true reason for the infamous No Más episode has become perfectly intelligible in the larger narrative of Durán's brilliant career.
One of the best love stories I have ever came across. The ending will have you crying like a baby!
Special Effects: 1,0/Sound Effects: 1,0/Acting: 1,0/Story: 2,0
Lots of fun... a must see
Freaking classic don't @ me
such a good love story! piper and lena rock!!! Pretty much my favorite movie ever!
Excellent. "Manny"'s grin at the end summed it up beautifully.
One of my all time faves!!!!
Good movie. Why so many dislike it is beyond me.
Fun, smart, and so hilarious. The cast is amazing and the message is clear. These women made this movie a blast.
I don't know why this movies receives so many low ratings.  It's a decent film.
The real winner of this film is the subject himself, Carrol Spinney. The film making itself is pretty straight-ahead, and the sound track is lousy (No percussion at all? Who's idea was that? This is a movie of men and muppets, for the love of puppetry give us an occasional rhythm or beat!). That said, Carrol Spinney, the man behind the bird and the grouch, really carries the film just by being himself. Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch are iconic world-renowned characters that continue to enjoy a long legacy. And Mr. Spinney demonstrates himself to be a person full of creativity, love, joy, pain, and a genuine passion for his work and for his wife. I would recommend this film as a solidly entertaining watch with lasting pathos.
I just watched the Equalizer 2 and loved it!  As always, Denzel Washington is outstanding, deep, compassionate, and unpredictable.  I love the way he mentors the young actors as he continues to make events less of himself and more about integrity, doing what is right, and how an "eye for an "eye" plays into life situations.  Always has been and will be in my top percentage of favorite actors.
FREAKING HILARIOUS!  Oliver Platt is always funny and the fact that Paul Ben-Victor is in it only gives it more bonus points.
one of the best movies ever made. i cried so much no one could ever imagine, amazing and shockingly superb performances by each actors. The most popular film in Indian history -- it's said to have been playing somewhere in the country every day since its release. A gem made in the 'Golden Age' of Indian cinema. loved it alot. outstanding.
I wasn't going to bother watching this film, I was going to go through the rest of my life not even giving it a chance. Well, I came across it on Youtube...I was bored..so I watched it. You're probably thinking I'm going to bash on this film, call it a disaster, tell you that Paris' acting was horrendous....I'm not going to be doing that.  The only time I've ever seen Paris 'acting' was on this show she had with Nicole Richie. Well, her acting in this movie was....great. Of course she played the everyday 'hot' chick that guys lust after, I mean you'd expect that from a Paris Hilton film. Her character Cristabel was very likable..very kind.  This was really funny, I laughed at mostly everything. Many people will say that this film was giving off a message that you should be 'perfect' but I just think those people are way too sensitive.  This movie was...amazing. It's worth 5 stars and worth seeing again. People should check it out. :)
I don’t understand the low ratings on this movie, it’s the funniest movie I’ve seen in a long time! There were some corny scenes but my Husband and I both laughed out loud so many times. The cast was perfect and it was a great light comedy that’s not meant to be taken too seriously, our kind of comedy. 
Hillarious!!!  Ryan Pinkston is so FUNNY!!!
great movie ,really loved it, very well written with a great cast
Super original and cinematic
this movie ruined my life
Great watch and a must see! Very informative!
Simply I loved it! It presents the Maori culture from an interesting aspect. The fight scenes are very good. Authentic work.
I recommend this movie.  Ignore the jaded critics.  Totally enjoyable and makes you think.
Loved it. Adam Driver's character sent this one to the moon for me.
One of the most important and informative films of our generation. It'll forever change how you look at the medical community, the government and 'science'. Whenever a movie has been banned or elicits this kind of controversy, and causes such intense outrage amongst the powers at be, you have to realize it's going to cut into someone's profit margin. That "someone"?  All those who profit off of poisoning our children via vaccines.
Wonderful, heartfelt, feel good movie about Roberto Duran and his amazing trainer. The cast is spot on and the performances are memorable. The boxing is realistic and done with such style it makes you understand what it feels to be on top of the ring. These boxers did it all for honor, country and family, and when Duran strays its his honor, his love for his country and his family what brings him back to become a champion again. Sugar Ray Leonard and Ray Arcel are both described as the gentlemen that made Boxing a true sport. Great movie, glad I saw it on the big screen.
This movie was amazing. My husband and I have never laughed so hard. I guess because we have a 3 year old and 1 year old I can TOTALLY relate. Everything they mentioned was true! Things definitely change and we knew that so we laughed the entire time! I'll probably watch again. Great movie!
streamed it, loved it,  ordered 10 copies at wholesale price of $12.48 each to donate to local libraries, etc.
This movie is the best faith based film I have ever seen! Also a generally good movie altogether!
The Beat Beneath My Feet is a sublimely inspiring musical film with good tunes, fantastic performances, and a heart like a lion. Talented newcomer Nicholas Galitzine exceeds expectations, both with his acting as well as with his singing.  90210 heartthrob Luke Perry proves that he still has the chops with his committed performance as a faded rock star tortured by the past. The film also features strikingly surreal music transitions that brilliantly serve as metaphors for what is happening in the film's plot. All in all, The Beat Beneath My Feat soars as a toe-tapping, feel-good flick!
Glen Jacobs is back in need see no evil 2 with great hardcore vengeance what he does better in a wrestling ring he doesn't better on movies get ready for the upcoming film see no evil 2.  This movie is so good better than the first installment
Love this movie. A must watch for every parent!
I totally loved this movie ! It so reminded me of the old days of Spike Lee. But it's a great film of this boys life struggles and friendship
great boxing movie depiction of Robert Durant life and American imperialism
Probably one of the best films ever made with likely the best soundtrack for a movie I have ever heard. You'll never guess what's going to happen next. An excellent film in a genre all it's own with a story that is fiction, but somehow believeable. The film's relentless pace ensures the excitement rarely flags. Pun intended :) :)
Incredible!!  A must watch!
Love the new actors especially Rodrick, he was quite sexy. The comedy was top notch especially diaper hands it was so funny i came in my popcorn. The beardos were a great addition to the movie the actor reminded of my sexy uncle, T.Hoetzl.
Incredibly eye opening and terribly disturbing. A must see!
So hilarious I loved it 
This is an emotional and gripping tale. I was very pleased with the writting and direction of the film. The cinematography was outstanding. This is one of the most exciting art films ever produced. I'd say this film is on par with anything Danny Boyle or Paul Thomas Anderson has directed.
Through the eyes of the victim, in so many ways, we experience the chilling reality of a woman in a difficult situation after the death of her departed lover. She does her best to incorporate fantasy in her life, despite the hardships. A 'fantastic' work for cinematography and acting by Daniela Vega.
The book was phenomenal! The cast was poorly picked, it's cheesy and nothin like the book. Don't waste your time.
This movie is ridiculous. The younger Dawson looks 10 years older than the present Dawson, it is full of clichÃ (C)s and recycled scenes, and the story unnecessarily twists and winds way out of proportion to the point that it is laughable. The movie is enjoyable enough until the last 15 minutes where it gets absolutely ridiculous, at which point you feel duped for not realising a lot sooner that you are wasting your time.
Probably one of the worst boxing movies I ever saw. Usher a was a horrible person to cast for this movie, and it was a poorly written script. A huge let down.
I watched this for the first time, and let's just say that it is 1.5 hrs of my life I will never get back, and it makes me sad. I am shocked and saddened that Bullock and Cooper would stupe so low! Did someone blackmail them into this horrible film? Indeed neither of them willingly chose it, right? If you haven't watched it, keep going... Hallmark and its predictable storylines are more entertaining!
This movie sucks !!!! The synopsis should said: a guy who fall in love in Siberia and has some drunk Russians friends and finally he ends as a kind of "martyr" cause he miss his flight
The most glorious element of this film was it's ridiculously camp decorand costuming redolent of the 1970's, which I got guilty about enjoying, bout these touches were a thin veneer for a story which didn't fly with any integrity of real gay lives.  The script re-itetated all the steretypes of a heterosexual purview where heterosexuality is the template and lens through which the otherness of same sex male relationships ate viewed as fake aberrations doomed for failure or caricature.  I find it depressing that every screen writer feels compelled to make all gay relationships non functional and doomed to failure.  I enjoyed the music, and there were some mildly comic moments, but the characters lacked any emotional depth thus leaving the audience disinterested in their destinies. I still would love to rob the dressing room of the lead protagonist.
Horrible dialogue, badly acted and car sceens poorly staged.
un film très ennuyeux d'un vieille fille fiancée qui harcèle son  domestique et le traite presque comme un esclave. a évité!  vide d'actions. Nous avons réussis à tenir 20 minutes avant d'arrêter.
Not my favorite som what funny 
Really boring film: very slow, unimaginative, no real excitement.
the length of the movie is too short. I feel like there was a lot that they could have left out in the movie to leave room for expanding on the main plot. Like the relationship between the father and their neighbor. In the book it's good, because it's not rushed and there's a lot more scenes with them. Or starting the movie with Chinese New Year. Again, in the book it's sweet and fun to read, but in the movie, there's really no reason to show it, since the dad is barely a character in the movies and since kitty was barely in the second movie either. Also, because of how little time there was we didn't get to see much of John Ambrose OR the good parts of LJ and Peters relationship, so it's hard to feel connected to either couple. If the movie only shows LJ and peters relationship at its worse, there's no reason for us to want them to end up together. The movie was a sad addition to the series. I recommend reading the books for a lot more clarity on the plot.
Terrible. Dude she ended up with last movie is a controlling jerk the whole movie. But in the end she gets back with him anyway. Remember kids: if he's hot and popular that's all that matters.
Insufrible, interminable, aburrida, tediosa y me quedo corto. Es casi una tortura verla completa
Really just a dreadful film.  The shot set-ups are nice and everything is professionally done, but this anthology lacks a story to back of its basic theme, which is never really explored in an interesting way.  Beyond that, lapses in logical character behavior leave a lot of frustrating moments.
Could only get through half of it. It was poorly written, had no pacing, and I have to think that the writer was going through a divorce at the time, given the way women were portrayed. It was a great cast, but Marisa Tomei deserves better, so does Allison Janney and really, every woman that appeared on that screen. Seriously, when one of the two boys (and yes, I use that term derogatively) in the screenwriting class pens a script that is a Star Wars knock-off and gets recommended for production, well...was all of this meant to be irony? Because if we know you're making a comedy and we're laughing going in, maybe that would have explained so much...
I'll give it credit for being atmospheric and creepy in certain moments, but other than that it's a major letdown. The film was so focused on making Olivia Wilde's character such a sinister villain, that they forgot the dog was also brought back and had problems too.
This is one of the worst horror movies I've seen in 2015.
Ugh. Boring AND stupid. Dont bother. I enjoy bad movies as long as theyre fun. This isnt.
No one ruins a really great love story like . . .  drum roll . . . Nicholas Sparks . . . and . . . he does so for absolutely no good, bad or ugly reason . . . and . . . he does so far, far too often.
Garbage music and L.A. Cliches. Not even Malcolm McDonald could save this movie. Avoid at all cost.
Comedia sessao da tarde.
Predictable plotline, not funny, disappointing. Expected more from this movie.
I was WAY less impressed than I wanted to be. Bits of story that went nowhere, too many things left unexplained, an overall lack of action and a complete falloff at the end that left me ready to turn it off 30 minutes before the movie was over.
Something tells me that H.G. Wells was rolling over in his grave when this movie came out...
Brendan Frasier turns in a soulful performance as a Harvard student.  Joe Pesci whom I really don't like, turned in an as expected performance of a bum holding Frasiers thesis hostage.  The film tries to make social commentary but ultimately fails in this endeavor.  It's perhaps worth viewing once on cable, but viewers be thankful you didn't waste your money in the theater or buying the film ( unless you fished it out of the dollar bin)
First movie with Keanu Reeves that I shut off. And within 30 minutes. 
I kind of enjoyed it.
Never has a movie character unfuriated me more than the father depicted in this film.
Despite the title, this has nothing to do with the HG Wells story it was supposedly based on. The mutant creatures look of normal size and it really isn't very scary. This is bad, even for a B-movie.
Stupid film, futuristic smart building and she can't turn on camera at phone to record what she see. Whole  film  this bass sound, i am regret what i was buy nice speakers, also too much flickering pictures. Terrible movie, actor  and story in good though
Shit film. Nothing happens. Not even fun cringe. Character arcs were completely unsatisfactory.
The story line sucked. The acting was good and the first half of the movie I loved. I had no idea what it was going into it. But left very disappointed
what a stinker. keaunu,,get some standards!
Pretty sad movie. Very one-sided. One only has to go online to see that these animal activists don't really help animals. See what happened to "free Willy" movie follow-up.
Pitch Perfect 3 is one of the most unnecessary films in recent memory, especially since they ditched everything that made the first two so enjoyable. The third act of the atrocity is mind boggling bad and makes zero sense.
Hulk Hogan goes all soft and makes a complete arse of himself in the process. This sort of thing might have been exciting to me as an 8 year old but itâ(TM)s really just a tragic, tragic thing. I know WWF was a pantomime soap opera but there really is no excuse for this.
While there is much to be commended in the fact that director Guillaume Canet and his production team have here in Blood Ties created a very decent recreation of the 1970's (with an overuse of record players, we get it OK, there weren't IPod's/CD's back then!) there is also much to be made of the fact that Blood Ties is a lifeless, seen a thousand times before, dull and dreary tale that fails to announce to us just why it exists.  On paper, things within Blood Ties would seem to add up to a pretty decent family/crime drama, even moments within seem to suggest Sidney Lumet was a huge inspiration. We have a name cast in the form of Clive Owen, Mila Kunis, Zoe Saldana and the ever disappointing Billy Crudup, then behind the scenes you have a film not only produced but co-written by crime genre specialist James Grey and director Guillaume Canet who has a decent track record in his native homeland of France with films such as the excellent Tell No One and the decent Little White Lies, but nothing within Blood Ties ads up to any anything decent, nothing we see here feels emotionally engaging and no one truly seems to care enough to change it.  Blood Ties needed someone too step up their game exceptionally within the piece, yet all participants seemingly rested on their laurels with the material and expected fireworks to happen. Canet's direction clearly did not help this dull overbearing feeling however with his stale, beyond workmanlike gig behind the camera transferring to one of the most bereft of life movies you'd care to see. Where is the tension to be found between warring brothers? The heart pounding experience of a crime in progress or the sparks between lovers? There is none of that to be found here despite the potential for it.  Bloods Ties best moments are all taken/borrowed from other much better films of the same genre, whether it be a climatic train station scene (Carlito's Way), a bank heist gone wrong (Heat) or brothers torn between loyalty to their family/friends or loyalty to their job (We Own the Night or State of Grace) and they go to show you just what can be done with this type of film if it's done right. Blood Ties doesn't do many things right and that makes this a film worthy of being crossed off your to watch list, even if the cast list looks like a sure fire success.  1 record player out of 5   For more movie reviews and opinions check into -   www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com
Horrible; no plot.  Any they said Seinfeld was a show about nothing.  What wade of time and talent!
Probably one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen...
The outtakes were funnier than the movie......
I genuinely have no idea why this movie was made. It just wasn't necessary. Let's be honest, we all know the plot and know "Whodunnit" because we've all seen the eclipsing version starring Albert Finney from the 1970s. Where Sidney Lumet directed  that version with the grace and agility of Nureyev, here, Kenneth Branagh stomps all over the proceedings like a navvy in hob-nail boots.  It is an utterly cringe-worthy affair and the stellar cast, including Branagh himself, play their roles as though this is some cheap, TV movie from the 1970s. Like a second rate episode of Hart To Hart or Cannon.  Branagh plays a version of Poirot that is so far removed from the character as written by Agatha Christie as to be almost comical. A complete travesty and I can't say I am looking forward to the potential for a follow-up version of Death on the Nile that is trumpeted at the close of this film. One to be avoided at all costs!
This would have been better off as an animated video, rather than a live action. The CGI was poorly executed and the plot was overly used and very lazy.  I fell asleep trying to watch this.
So angsty and missing a lot of the quirkiness and charm of the first movie.  Plus Lara Jean's eyelashes look way too fake.
Ugh, what a pointless, practically note-for-note remake of the fantastic original that is horribly mis-cast and feels like everyone phoned it in for a paycheck. I checked out of this thing after 25 minutes when I realized that I was just waiting for all the classic scenes (and kills) to rear their heads and see if they're as effective as the original: the answer is no. John Moore is a terrible director and tries to add stuttery images, jump scares, and a freakin dream sequence to scare you in the most cliche of ways. The only delight I had watching this version was seeing Mia Farrow play the nanny, but alas, she's not given much to do and she's hardly on screen. Just watch the original.
Rarely is a movie so scientifically flawed - the central plot device of this film is so ridiculous that it might as well be an Iron Man movie with repulsors.  Additionally - aluminum (baseball bat), copper and lead (bullet) are not even magnetic.
Bad, boring "nature's revenge" movie that p
The only interesting thing is the wife's eccentricity. I like Adam Driver but, this movie went nowhere.
stupid!!! nick cannon cannot act!! only funny in wild n out!
Joe Dirt is a terrible movie. It tries to be funny, and it doesn't work. AT ALL.
An absolutely insufferable "comedy" which I ALMOST decided I couldn't make it through, but I decided to soldier through only to find it got worse and worse!
Terrible! The ending is the worst you can imagine. I love Keanu but this film is an all time low. 
The teenage son of Andy Sandberg and Joseph Gordon Levitt falls madly in love with a pretty young girl. He then grows up to become Cyclops from the X-Men. The girl marries Old Michael Cera and nobody ends up happy. My wife cried. Possibly sadder than What Dreams May Come.
This is just stupid in so many ways!
I was waiting and waiting for this movie to get better. For all or those just starting this movie, save yourself! Turn it off. One of the worst movies I have ever watched...and I have watched a lot.
As an avid reader of the books this was a TERRIBLE try at turning great novels into a movie....  Michael Keaton was maybe the only smoldering ash of a bright spot.  The lack of silencers, the jumbled storylines, everything.  If I had paid for a ticket and not watched it on Netflix I might ask for my money back.
This movie was a total waste of time.  I excepted way more out of both Christina Ricci (who I love but, under played this role entirely) and the writer..... give me a break.
can't get into it...need a better plot, storyline and overall acting. Keanu alone can never carry a movie; point break...he had swayze. matrix he had fishbourne. and so on.
Not good on so many levels.
ill be nice and give it 1 lol
This movie was painfully boring to finish. I kept expecting something big to happen just to be disappointed. It's a love story that's retarded. But damn, I had a good laugh throughout the movie because of how CHEESY it truly is.
Detective John Shaft attempts to arrest a renegade elevator, and he makes some new friends along the way!
Very Forgettable movie with over the top action, bad dialog, bad special effects and a very odd storyline.
why?????just why????????????
Uneven story, sloppy effects, questionable ending with many loose ends.
Huh? Worst scoring ever in a movie. Relax buddy. Not every fart has to be scored. Ugh. 
This piece of junk may go close to worst movie ever made. Have such a bunch of miscast hacks ever trotted out such ridiculous dialogue or been so unbelievable as "bikers"? I can't recall ever seeing such embarrassing garbage. Bishop comes off about as intimidating as a gay bar social director. Utter horseplop - do not waste your time. Not even to stream for free.
It's Incredible that Danny de Vito, Michael Keaton and Collin Farrel would produce this terrible boring movie.  I think their talents have gone  down the drain.  how sad....
Movie was terrible, with over-the-top props and effects, coupled with blatantly unnecessary scariness.   Absolutely no plotline, and a failure of a movie overall.
It's just kinda ridiculous.
Bert I. Gordon. Look closely at the director's initials. It's B.I.G. and this director lives up to those initials as he loves things in his films to be BIG. He had previously made giant science fiction films such as The Amazing Colossal Man and War of the Colossal Beast in the 50's and he still lived by the mentality that "bigger is better" when the 70's rolled around. When American International Pictures offered him the chance to direct a film version of H.G. Wells' classic story The Food of the Gods he jumped all over the idea. Sadly the final product is a cinematic diarrhea that no doubt makes H.G. Wells turn over in his grave.  When a couple of pro football players decide to take a small vacation to do some hunting on a small island, they discover huge wasps that kill one of their party. Two of the players later return to kill the wasps but find out that insects aren't the only animals on the island to grow to gigantic size due to a strange white substance bubbling out of the Earth (perhaps "The Stuff'?), most notably rats. Now our football players, two scientists and some locals take refuge in a house and frantically try to come up with a plan to escape before becoming rat snacks.  H.G. Wells' original story was a monumental horror idea that was ahead of its time warning the dangerous repercussions of messing with mother nature. Our filmmakers take this concept, throw all credibility out the window to make an unintentionally cheesy (sorry for the pun) monster movie that takes itself stupidly serious. Thanks to this however it does make The Food of the Gods a "so bad it's good" laugh fest for B-movie connoisseurs.  So what makes it so bad? The first part is the awful special effects which were even dated at the time of this film's release in 1976. Bert I. Gordon was also handy in special effects so he loads the film up with unconvincing miniatures, giant fake chicken and rat heads, and forced perspective shots. All these effect techniques could have worked to make the animals believable but AIP and Bert Gordon decide to go the cheap route and the effects come out fake and silly. Second is the truncated plot concept of H.G. Wells' story and our filmmakers just focuses on people being killed by giant fake rats. Our stock players of recognizable character actors also take the silly material seriously adding to the unintentional hilarity.  The Food of the Gods was laughed at for its awfulness when it was originally released and it has gained a small cult following over the years due to this fact. For a silly B-movie it can be fun, even if it does take a shit on a classic H.G. Wells story. Surprisingly a sequel would follow 13 years later with Gnaw: Food of the Gods II.
This one was awful, too.  Such a good cast but a painful movie.
The Giant Gila Monster features poor production values, monster movie cliches, and one too many "rock-&-roll" numbers.
Not good. In fact, The Soy Next Door is very bad on so many levels. Kids should have fun but for most this is just something to add to the bad Jackie Chan collection rather than the good Jackie Chan collection.
Bad as bad can be. Ridiculous screen play/book.
This film had an original idea, but the tension, suspense, and horror just falls flat.
Cringe-y, terrible movie. It couldn't be less sexy, funny, or romantic if it tried. Waste of time.
I was bored from the beginning and couldn't make it to halfway.
Just one big convoluted nonsensical mess of a movie. To make matters worse, my DVD copy had only Spanish and French subtitles, and with the sound quality being awful, this all added up to one bad viewing experience. Save yourself the grief.
Had high expectations, was ruined by back and forth lies. The trailer was more thrilling. This movie felt more like a Spanish novella.
The story was not edited in the right order to make it more impactful and suspenseful. 
(19%) One of the laziest scripts ever written? I think it may be. The opening shows random action clips from other Jackie movies, I'm guessing because the makers couldn't be bothered to make a proper opening sequence themselves and almost everything in the entire movie has been done so many times before. Chan is still hugely likeable and he at least gives something positive to the movie, but this is still a weak attempt to expand his career.
the first 2 movies were in ovation and brought back the anthology movie. the second one being the best but this third and final is about as meaningless as sunglasses at night. the story has no connection with the first 2 and some of the stories feel like they were thrown together just to fit into a movie they wanted to push out fast. the only good one I thought was the skateboarding section. definitely skippable.
If I could go below one star, I would. The movie made me laugh about twice but multiple time I contemplated turning it off. I guarantee if I paid to watch it, I'd demand for a refund!
Terrible horrible Disney reboot movie. I normally am a fan of whatever Tim burton does but as of late he's been making terrible movies. Like his last good movie was in my opinion the first Alice and wonderland movie reboot. I was never a fan of the animated dumbo movie, I like the ride at Disneyland but not a fan of this movie at all. Very forgettable.
Not funny and boring throughout. Just terrible.
This is a dud as in Ashley Judd.
So mind-numbingly plain and obvious you wonder what compelled the stars to sign on in the first place. You can immediately tell it's written by a woman and it is very anti-male throughout. Basically a who-dunit that becomes a try-caring.
A film that we all knew would be terrible and it sure was just that, The story is old and has been done so many times, The action was poor and pretty lifeless, The effects were terrible, Poor acting and the script felt like it was written by teenagers, It's silly and corny it feels like a cheap PS2 game, The only reason it has a full star is because I have a soft spot for Milla Jovovich and I think she was only in it for the easy pay check.
I watched this as part of a so-bad-it's-good season at the Melbourne Comedy Festival - and it certainly fits the bill! Awful special effects, ludicrous dialogue and far too many shots of ferries. B.I.Gordon (check the initials!) is a genius!
Way too stupid to be funny
Some nice moments, but a very, very strange film.
Uninteresting and boring film, with a cast that I expected more from. Mark Duplass still doesn't seem comfortable in serious roles, hamfisting his way through this film, while Olivia Wilde differs little from her usual characterizations.
It started with potential, the acting was awful and the film got so stupid and predictable
Review: What a depressing movie! For a whole 2 hours, Brad Pitt (Roland), and Angelina Jolie (Vanessa), are in a hotel room getting on each others nerves, whilst looking through a hole in the room, at the couple next door. The storyline was awful and the acting wasn't that great from these to A-list stars. Whilst staying in France, Roland and Vanessa try to fix there troubled relationship but Roland can't seem to get through to Vanessa, who is suffering with depression. Roland spends most of his time drinking in a bar, and becomes friends with the owner, Michel (Niels Arestrup), who is also suffering after losing his wife. Whilst Roland is away, Vanessa peeps through a hole in there room, to spy on the young couple next door, Lea (Melanie Laurent) and François (Melvil Poupaud), and when Roland finds out what Vanessa has been doing while he's away, he also spies on the couple with her, hoping that it will bring them closer together. I personally couldn't see the point of this movie but when the plot unfolds towards the end, there was actually a meaning to what they were doing. With that aside, I still found the film extremely boring, and Jolie looked quite scary and really thin from the beginning to the end. Pitt did show some true emotion and I could totally understand his frustration towards Vanessa but there just wasn't enough material to make the movie interesting. I was impressed with Brad Pitt's French and the scenery wasn't bad but apart from that, I just couldn't get into it. Disappointing!  Round-Up: Like Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise, who also starred in a movie together before there break-up, I find it weird that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are in a movie about a troubled relationship while they are questioning there marriage! I know that this movie came out last year, so they might have been OK then but as the movie got released this year, questions must arise about the truth in this project. The movie was written and directed by Angelina Jolie, 41, who also directed A Place In Time, In The Land Of Blood & Honey and Broken. She really did give this project her all, and with her husband in the lead, she must have had faith in the script. The whole "Peeping Tom" element of the movie was a bit creepy, in my opinion, and it started to drag after a while. It could have easily been half as long, and the ending didn't put an end to there problems. Anyway, I really couldn't see were the budget went and I didn't get the moral of the story, if there was one.   Budget: $10million Worldwide Gross: $3.3million  I recommend this movie to people who are into their romance/dramas, starring Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Melanie Laurent, Melvil Poupaud, Niels Bohringer and Sarah Naudi. 2/10
I probably should have gave this half a star. But I'm in a generous mood today.
What the Fu** is wrong with this movie. started so good, and become this cheap zomby in space movie
not funny, not original, too predictable; actors were ok though
Totally forgettable the minute the end credits role.  Completely weightless action venture manufactured by the modern day flop king Kevin Costner.
Well-meaning but fundamentally flawed, the Burnin' Medallion Of Badness-worthy "Collateral Beauty" aims for uplift but it collapses in unintentional hilarity. Characters: 1/5 Story: 0.5/5 Acting: 0.5/5 Special Effects: 1/5 Direction: 1/5 Cinematography: 0.5/5 Soundtrack: 0/5 Overall: 1/5
How many times does it take before a brilliant detective realises she is being constantly roofied and passing out? Answer: 4
This is a "coming of old age" movie. Anyone in their late 50's and older who is in the process of writing the next chapter of their life can relate to this. To move or not to move? Do the memories made in this house justify staying and making more? Have we seen everything from this view? Can I still do a 4 or 5 or 6 flight walk-up? Do I succumb to External forces, (children, realtors, millenials).  This movie may be formulaic, but, guess what, so is most of life.
blood ties is an OK crime drama about two brothers in 1974 ones a cop and the other one is involved with a criminal mob as a clash over different things that happen. Very good cast Clive Owen Mila Kunis and Billy Crudup and James Caan. B- (2014)
Chadwick Bosman really carried this movie.
An interesting look at the man beneath the Big Bird costume. Not surprisingly, he's a good and gentle person. Lots of nostalgia, we also get a look at Spinney and his interesting friendship with Jim Henson.
My son liked it and he is 13.
Engaging and suspenseful. It was a fun ride, all the way through.
The movie intended to deliver a fine message.  Based on the true story of Christina Noble, a charity worker from Ireland who went to Vietnam to help the street kids. This movie follows the stories from two different timelines. It opened with Noble's childhood days, from her struggling family to how she lost everything. Wanted to be a singer, but her terrible childhood turned her dream upside down and finally ended up in Vietnam finding her way to give children who needed love and care. Beside her intention was that no one should go through like she did.  It is a beautiful and inspiring story, but the movie was not great. Because the stars and crews were not well known, but their contribution must be appreciated to spotlight this great lady, Chritina Noble. It also won some prestigious international awards as to recognising its valuable message. This British movie was written and directed by the husband of actress who portrayed in the title role. It is not an entertaining movie, but just like documentary films it was filled with strong contents that makes it must not be missed.  7/10
This film uses every single visual trick known to man in order to bring giant animals to life on the big screen to terrorize a oddball group of people on an island. While some thing don't add up storywise and some of the visual FX aren't very good, this film is still a favourite of mine.  The creativity used in order to bring everything to life is just amazing and the concept behind the film is truly something to think about. If you like your horror movies to be schlocky hysterical pieces of amusement, Food of the Gods is likely right up your alley.  It's not a well done film, but it's still a good one :)
It's quite entertaining to watch I would recommend it's almost like the movie gravity but gravity is much better I loved the dynamics of this movie so overall recommend
Good movie by itself, solid and good use of foreshadowing etc; but as a death note successor it didnt live up to par.
Hilarious and well done
Damn Good Movie.   Qctio0n, Intrigue, multiple twists.  I don't know why so many people disliked it.  I does require a tense patience all the way too the end
In a suburban town, four teenage girls find themselves fighting for their lives when some very private information about the townspeople gets posted online. I wanted to love this movie. I mean, it did enough to earn my respect. Unfortunately, it falls well short of being a movie I can recommend.  Acting; 10  Beginning: 10  Characters: 10  Cinematography/Visuals: 8 Director Sam Levinson begins the film by capturing the essence of the daily lives of the four girls the story revolves around. You see them joking around, getting ready for a night out on the town, texting and doing all the social media stuff. It's not long before the movie takes an extremely jarring turn. It's a sharp curve and I appreciate the contrast. The movie maintains its bright vitality even as people are dying all over the place. Like it or not, it's hard to look away.  Conflict: 7 Assassination Nation is slow in a number of spots. It's like a sputtering car: hard to get going and once it does, it's only a matter of time before it begins to stop again. There are a number of intense moments, but they are either few and far between or too little too late. From the title, I expected more.  Genre: 2  Memorability: 1 I am racking my brain trying to remember moments from this movie. It comes to me in pieces, but not spectacular pieces. The movie overall is missing a serious punch. It's trying to succeed at being something it's not and it shows. I mean, REALLY shows.  Pace: 8  Plot: 4  Resolution: 7 As messy as the movie can be at times, you are always hoping that the girls get a decent payoff. I won't ruin what happens but I will say that, although it's not perfect, it definitely beats the movie's saggy middle.  Overall: 67 Assassination Nation is the kind of movie you watch once to say you did then move on forever. At best, it's meh. Just when you get a glimpse of things improving, they fall below expectations. Again and again.
A slow moving but engaging film about the friendship between James Dean & Life Photographer just before James Dean became a household name.  Both Actors especially Dane was sensational as Dean & captured a less glamorous & realistic episode of his life in NYC.  I found it so interesting that despite James Dean & cameraman didn't get along & where quite stressed out but still produced some of the best photos one could imagine.
It's intense and has a different twist. Lots of action. Good cast. Plot gets a bit murky and complicated.
was a good movie except for the animation scenes and it has a bad and unrealistic ending
I wasn't expecting to like "Down to Earth" that much, with most of the reviews saying this is an average film. Is it really average? How often in Technicolor musicals does a Greek muse come down to earth to fix up a stage production? Certainly this isn't the same type of four star film that most people rate, but I merely give it that many for it's entertainment. Rita Hayworth was one of the top box-office draws in the '40's, and this was the follow-up to the massive success of 1946's "Gilda", which was virtually something most film lovers like today. OK, I knew it wouldn't be as good as the latter, but still, this is still worth the see. Technicolor musicals were the most popular type of movie during the WWII period, and entertainers like Betty Grable, Esther Williams, and Rita Hayworth always were the ones that were making money for the studios, pretty much making a feel-good, color after the other. Most of Rita's aren't available on this website, so I saw this primarily for that. I wasn't disappointed. Sure, the songs aren't that great, and neither is the acting, but this is great entertainment! Every dance number isn't really a waste, and Hayworth's background in the art really makes her a standout. Maybe she couldn't sing (she was dubbed), but she could do something! The color is certainly its nicest here and has really aged well over time, and luckily the print is in ship-shape. Though this movie is over half a century old, I still felt that short lasting euphoria that most of these movies give. Need I say more? "Down to Earth" isn't a classic, but hey, it doesn't waste time!
"Did you see the size of that chicken!"-Dirty Steve Stephens (Dermot Mulroney) YOUNG GUNS  Attack of the gaint Gordon animals, again.
(66%) A very convincing 1970's set crime drama featuring a solid cast and a decent character based story. Clive Owen is a truly fine screen presence and he's great in this, and because he and everyone else are so good, along with the few bits of gripping and intense action, meaning that the flaws in the script and a couple of minor issues here and there don't really matter that much. This will likely get seen by about half as many people than it deserves, but despite that, and for Mr Clive Owen especially, this is worth a very nostalgic trip to the cinema.
Fresh retelling of a joyful story, well acted and visually stunning sets.
The Possession of Michael King doesn't break any new ground in the found footage horror genre, but what makes it above average and therefore the frightening scenes much scarier is that we are invested in the story. It's got disturbing deaths, frightening images, and truly horrifying moments that made would make anyone shriek like a little girl. Shane Johnson did a solid job as the titular character, but hands down to the director by using effective graphic images and effects, this low budget film delivers classic, old-school, emotional suspense that typically doesn't make it into the Hollywood big budget films. Horror fans, gore hounds, thrill seekers & chill seekers are going to love this. Yea it did make me shriek like a little girl - Embarrassing! :P
Should be shown to every fundamentalist!
Keanu Reeves takes off his shirt, what more is their to say.
Though this movie didnt have the budget like some other horror movies. It still kept my attention and was a nice spin. I think if a bigger budget was used with some A listers and just slight tweaks to the story, this could be a great movie.
Kinda good, kinda funny, got some really funny stuff but it is not awesome
Was kinda good, but not as slash and gash as the first!!
Cheesy Werewolf Movie- but it appears to be intended more funny than serious- I hope at least
It's Gitai through and through. Love the tangible tensions and emotions.
AKA: "My Big Fat Gay Italian Wedding". Takes too much aim at ethnic stereotype,s but has truth and compassion for every character.
This movie should have been made by John Hughes in the early eighties.
A stunning film. One of the best of the year so far
Funny and all what you want ...good movieweek again  ! Interesting
Slow and sweet- a uniquely Australian story- without the forced quirkiness. It's funny, romantic and intelligent.
A few loose ends I felt were left unanswered.
A GREAT and memorable western with a (as always) magnificent Lee Van Cleef... It may not be Sergio Leone but you can't always have the cream of the crop. If you're a fan of the western genre I strongly recommend this one.
Its nice to see a movie with a plot that hasn't been rehashed a thousand times.  The ending is over-the-top, but then so is the rest of the movie. . . The age-old question "Does a bear shit in the woods?" is answered.  
The first one was way better but I watched this one with joy as well mostly because of the cuteness of the cast and I can't believe I cried a little in the end. And I'm at the age when teenage romance shouldn't effect me.
Tough and responsible.
Slightly better than the first. It has a great cast going for it with some fairly likable characters. While the deaths aren't as inventive as the original, they're passable, and all contained in a great setting.
a whole lot better than the first ..These twins should keep directing this and make it one hell of a franchise! !!
I enjoyed this arthouse cinema movie, set in France during the 1970's, written and directed by Angelina Jolie  7/10 Rev 304
Hiam Abbass gives fantastic performance, Natalie Portman, too.  I love the beginning, which Natalie cried all the length of the song, and the end, argument of Israeli and Palestinian.
Playtime seems the type of film one has to watch more than once to appreciate. I have seen it one time and my impression is similar to the one I had of Mon Oncle. At first the comedy is amusing and the shots are amazing. As the film progresses the scenes become longer, more tedious, things drag, and Playtime is not fun any more. Still, I would recommend a view to those always on the lookout for something different and extraordinary.
suspense keeps the intrigue alive up to a point where director shows the viewers the guilty party whitout any build-up, so the ending did't meet expectations
An indulgent Denzel-fest. Portraying a man of unflinching morals, at the cost of all else. The story the character inhabits dithers about, not committing to a single driven narrative that takes a lot of detours and tangents and yet remains by-the-numbers at its core. As oscar-baity as it was, doesn't quite manage to hold the attention and keep you emotionally invested for the pay-offs. Watch it if you love Denzel and see his (Arguably) best performance and other actors too. Too long and drawn-out otherwise.
Laughable, goofy but gleefully entertaining cautionary tale. Plays out like Night of the Living Dead only with giant rats.
Although many films have similar plots and courtroom drama this one added a nice twist at the end.  Not perfect but at least it was made with actors and not computer imaging so talent was used over electronics.
In lesser hands this could have been a SciFi channel filler movie, but the director and all involved really elevate the material.
It is hard for me to dislike this movie. All of the pieces were there, but unfortunately the last half of the movie left out the initial mystery of the first half.  Stay Alive it's a guilty pleasure.
Straight forward B horror.
Sobrenatural segue a fórmula dos incontáveis filmes de terror da atualidade, o que inclui cenas de jump scare e o espírito maligno clássico. Seus "pontos fortes" são alguns momentos engraçados que ajudam a quebrar um pouco o ambiente pesado do filme e os personagens carismáticos e divertidos.
This is a weir movie that I like for some reason I cannot put my finger on. The story is not incomprehensible. It is simple. Vampire is a disease. There is a cure. Add a big-brother element and some gun and sword play, place the plot in the future where helicopters still exist but motorcycles can defy gravity, and you have a flashy quirky comic book movie. Not deep, just fun, for the most part.
Between 3 and 3.5 stars. This story of the evolution of the soul of a man is interesting by its character, but it has a problem with the narrative. Anyway, the final result shows you something about how we believe we are.
6.6/10 The three performances were the main force of the movie, that was actually dragging for the most part, but it had it's good dramatic moments. However, I do have to say that it was a bit boring in some scenes because there wasn't much going on even though there should have. But still, Jessica Chastain was great as always and even if this wasn't her best character or performance, she still carried the titular role on her shoulders extremely well, while also Colin Farrell was really good and on par with Chastain in all of their scenes together, and lastly Samantha Morton also was very good giving some contrast to the story. Overall, the story was a bit strange to me because it's characters were very complicated and so it was sometimes for hard to follow them and also the story only takes place in basically the same places, so that made it also go more slow. But the performances were really good and probably the best thing about the movie.  ~February 7, 2015~
Although it has it's flaws, Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence make this movie extremely watchable and a lot of fun, by no means a boring movie but without the two leads it would definitely have been a generic sci-fi romp.
I enjoyed this film more than most. I enjoyed the premise and the character building was an important part of the film. Most of the jokes I found funny and even found my self laughing at some. However some jokes don't stick.
Classic! Halle picked the right movie to uplift her life in a really dark moment. It's more silly than it is funny but it's a fun movie to watch. Job well done
Great first half, very exciting and tense, but then a sudden weird tonal shift into being a film about a manic hoarding hermit, with Nicole Kidman whispering barely intelligible nonsense and all the main characters ignoring each other for 45 mins.     The last 5 minute were good though.    Seems the director Garth Davis still a bit of a newbie, will see if his next film has better pacing.
It is indeed a romantic comedy. All the leads are lovable. Watching Piper Perabo, talk in an English accent is a plus. There is no tension in the film which I liked. It's just smooth, no complications and cute. There are lots of funny parts that are very witty. Rachel's little sister is so clever!  Rachel followed her heart and hurt people along the way but that's just for the best of everybody 'cause at the end, all of 'em really found their own happiness. What I love about this film is that they became true rather than stay in what they think is right but does not feel right. What happened at the end benefits everybody's best interests!  This film is truly a love at first sight between a girl meets girl. 7/10.
I enjoyed this one plus lots of 70's eye candy
I was looking forward to seeing this for some time now! Great seeing Danielle Harris and Katharine Isabelle together in a slasher movie! I liked how the Soska sisters filmed the movie, but I will say I expected it to be insanely gory or have more creative kills like the first one, they were very tame in comparison. The ending was decent but I don't know why they chose the "person" they chose as the final one. That was silly. Aside from that the movie is a solid slasher. If you like the genre you will enjoy it.
a descent western revenge flick with some twist and turns to make it worth while
Exceptionally poorly written but the best acting I've ever seen from Jude Law. He is exceptional in this film, which is very funny but gives up half way through.
Latimore brings about a clear, easy-to-relate-to character that leaves the audience falling for him. His soft voice is perfect for the character, as it allows the audience to understand his vulnerability, and makes it clear that despite the adult duties he has took upon himself, he is still very young. I also love the mystery to the character, allowing for future installments of this franchise to shed some light on his background.
I would have liked a better use of cinematography in this film, the Hawkesbury River looks like a beautiful place and I wanted to see more.  The film moved nicely and I felt had the right touch of comedy and drama so that it didn't come off too light or too heavy.  I really enjoyed it.
Not as fun as most Jackie Chan movies, this is still pretty entertaining and, on Amazon Prime, the price is right.
The critics have unjustifiably maligned this movie.  It is a tour-de-force on the part of Denzel Washington in a long line of other magnificent portrayals.  It is not without flaws but Denzel's performance compels you to continue watching despite whatever they may be.  It's no blockbuster in its appeal to mass audiences but it is a much better movie that the ratings suggest.
I loved the photography. I also thought the cast was good in the movie.
Pretty good flick. Beautifully shot in Shenandoah Valley actual locations. Well written & acted.
Better than the original, but still too long for what it is 
A family bonding tale after WWII between two children and their uncle/father (Colin Firth) after the deaths of their respective mothers in an enchanted garden in the uncle's estate. Beautifully filmed and heartwarming, very British.
This adaptation of The Secret Garden showed a bit darker look, but I truly enjoyed it. I feel that if it wasn't a book, it would still stand alone as a great film. Visually there were a lot of fantastic scenes that I wasn't expecting, so there was a lot for the eyes to enjoy.
it was not to bad love story ...
I enjoyed this light hearted, action and at time melancholy film. Nice to see that Jude Law can carry a film beyond being an elite style pretty boy. Richard E. Grant is, as always sublime. Been done before, but better than most  similarly themed films.
Presenting James Rolleston with a transition into a more adult-oriented role, The Dead Lands sounded like an entertaining New Zealand spectacle with acting to boot.  With The Dead Lands, nothing is in disguise. There is really no script in the film, and although the film makes some attempts to touch upon the violent history of New Zealand's native culture in an uncivilized era it is really an empty gesture which plays second fiddle to the spectacle ambitions of the film. Playing out like a pale imitation of Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (2006), The Dead Lands is essentially one big shot of the New Zealand wilderness with characters running and fighting across it all. There is a lot of visual glory to enjoy in it all the the actors remain dedicated to the project, but there is no doubt that it is simply a shallow piece and any attempts to divert audience awareness of this fact is little more than pretentious. The simple fact is that The Dead Lands is an exercise in style, and as its title suggests it is a depiction of death and land. If scenery and and violence is enough to maintain your attention for 108 minutes then The Dead Lands is definetely the film for you. But if you're hoping for more narrative ambition and character development over a fairly long stretch, then it's best to look elsewhere. There is a feeling that The Dead Lands relies on the shock value of its savage violence to capture the interest of audiences, but given the contemporary standard for cinematic violence it is all too clear that The Dead Lands is far too tame. It comes at a time where viewers are all too accustomed to this standard of violence and are likely to be more capable of spotting the lack of narrative. Audiences can rejoice at the fact that The Dead Lands is distant from the Hollywood sphere enough to depict its violence remorselessly without the demand for a PG-13 rating, but it can only carry the film so far. The Dead Lands carries a lot of magnificent action as the characters dedicate themselves to the fight choreography with extensive passion for swift movements and a fearless taste for violence. As an action junkie I cite much admiration for the realism of this all and the fact that the cinematography makes an effort to emphasize the violence and capabilities of the actors rather than disguising their limitations underneath shaky movements and quick-cuts to give the film a PG rating. However, as a thinking person I find that there are far too few thoughts actually being provoked by The Dead Lands. The film could have made commentary on the ancient Maori civilization by depicting the social constructs in which their society functioned as well as a greater emphasis on what it was to become a man and get thrust into battle. Alas, the film spends so much time focusing strictly on the battle itself that it might as well have not bothered with any kind of actual story at all. It almost doesn't, but the fact that there are a few moments that hint at more thought provocation than is ultimately realized proves to display unrealized potential. There is much to enjoy about the production values of the film and its action, but even as a big fan of cinematic battles I find that I was worn down by the excess of reliance on this and not on any kind of actual narrative. The film succeeds in depicting Maoris as being great warriors of battle, but anyone with half a brain knows that they are far more than just combat arms as they had a very distinctive culture to them. The Dead Lands only manages to capture half of this concept. And though it offers some entertaining fight sequences in the process, it just isn't enough. All in all, The Dead Lands doesn't offer anything particularly new to the table. Still, there is no denying that the efforts of the actors in The Dead Lands are impressive due to the way that they embrace the savage violence of the film with swift movements an energy which keeps up with the choreography at a brilliant pace. They also manage to all capture the appropriate headspace for the context of the story, collectively giving a realistic depiction of the brutal human savagery that epitomizes the time period of the narrative. But of course the standout is James Rolleston. Given that James Rolleston has consistently proved over the years that he has been capable of developing his dramatic charisma with age, The Dead Lands forwards him the opportunity to move up into a far more adult-oriented part. He isn't required to add much character development, but nevertheless he ensures that his character's forced adjustment to embrace his violent nature is taken on with reluctance. It's easy to recognize that he is maturing with age and so are his many talents, and seeing his new age manifest itself in this form gives a greater sense of value to at least one of the characters in The Dead Lands. James Rolleston's solid performance is another reminder of his talents, and his physical effort is one which delivers a powerful punch against his foes. Lawrence Makoare also brings in an intense supporting effort, maintaining an intimidating stature doing the many battles of the story. He has a fierce nature to him which echoes plenty of intensity simply through the stare in his eyes and the strong grip he has over his weaponry. The man is merciless and powerfully antagonistic, adding his own sense of edge to the story any time he is on screen thanks to his natural ability to command the attention of everyone around him and in front of the screen. Lawrence Makoare puts up a hell of a fight for The Dead Lands, and his dedication to the role is hard to ignore.  The Dead Lands offers a visual splendour of New Zealand scenery, brilliant action choreography and realistic violence, but audiences expecting any kind of actual story or characters need not apply.
I like the movie. But i hate that everyone in the movie is divorced and bear is unbearable! (No pun intended) The kids are adorable and the main character is decent. The Main plot is good but the bear and mother plot is meh.😐 Id reccomend this movie for boredom or if you need to entertain kids. Otherwise i like it.
A great and uplifting sports flick.
A charming romantic comedy, Imagine Me & You is quirky and lighthearted.  The story follows a newlywed named Rachel who, after having a chance encounter at her wedding, begins to question what love is and whether she has married for the right reasons.  The performances by Piper Perabo, Lena Headey, and Matthew Goode are exceptional, and the cast has impressive chemistry.  Additionally, the humor is quite clever and the storytelling is well-done.  Still, there are some underdeveloped plot elements and the directing is a bit weak.  Yet even with its flaws, Imagine Me & You delivers a fun and entertaining tale that takes a sincere and heartfelt look at love.
This is a good movie whilst not being too conventional in any way. A mixture of Close Encounters, Alien, X Files, Fire in the Sky and Blair Witch. Very good story, well acted.
At first I wasn't all that amazed by the movie until the ending. Wow..good movie!
An aspiring writer from a rough neighbourhood pens his emotion for his first love that got him a prestigious scholarship. Has a sad ending that makes it less predictable and more original.
Quite a dark psycological thriller.
Terriblement vibrant, Lion décrit avec sincérité un formidable parcours identitaire. Le genre de parcours dont on ne ressort pas indemne. 
I always enjoy films scored by Ennio Morricone
After a bit of an embarrassment with ‘The Great Wall', Yimou Zhang is back with another Wuxia epic that has some inventive fight scenes, as well as his signature flair added to the visuals, this time doing something very different from what we usually see from him (colourful, vibrant imagery) by going with a charcoal colour scheme that makes it an absolute feast for the eyes.   It falls a bit short on the story side with overly confusing elements that aren't very well explained and character arcs that don't affect you the way they have in his previous works.  Nevertheless, when it looks and sounds this good, it's difficult not to marvel.
Very underrated film, which is certainly a failed adaptation of a cult manga, but a good film with a clever final turnaround. Some inconsistencies, however!
Roman J. Israel, Esq. is a step down from director Dan Gilroy's debut film, Nightcrawler. However, it has an excellent character study and a just as good, if not better, script. Washington delivers one of his best performances of the decade, and the movie deals with a great theme of adapting to society in a fast, changing world.
Culture crossway.  So this is about a son (Viveik Kalra) in a Pakistani family living in England in the 1980s.  He is starting a new school, and he's about to find some life guidance in an unexpected place: from the music of American singer/songwriter Bruce Springsteen.  Now I missed this one in theaters, but I was in the majority there.  Blinded by the Light was a hit with critics, but for whatever reason, audiences just didn't come out for it.  I believe that the marketing is the most to blame because this followed a little too closely on the heels of Yesterday; while the two movies are doing drastically different things, the center of the Venn diagram is a little too large to get people to come back to the theater.  That's not to discount what they do here, as this is a very solid movie.  Now if I am being completely honest, I am not all that familiar with the library of Bruce Springsteen.  I know his more famous songs, but that's about it.  A testament to the quality of this film is that this movie made me want to become a fan.  You see how taken these young adults are with his music, and it makes you want to familiarize and see what the big deal is.  Even if you're like me and you don't have the background in the albums, it's not a prerequisite to watching this movie.  I'm sure it would do nothing but enhance the experience, but what makes this movie succeed is the story itself.  It's very grounded and easy to connect with.  There is conflict, but it is never overblown, and there is racism that this family has to deal with on a daily basis, but it's not always a life or death situation.  There are a lot of nice small moments within this family, and that is where this movie is at its strongest.  Viveik Kalra is very likable, and even though he clashes with his family, you understand where everybody is coming from.  You get to see the difference in cultures, especially immigrants reacting to their new country, and that is another angle where this movie finds success.  I know everything I've said speaks very highly of this, and Blinded by the Light is a charming movie that makes the two-hour runtime just fly by.  That said, it is a big ol' love letter to Bruce Springsteen, so there were a lot of extended stretches that aren't bad, but they really feel like they are there just for the fans.  It is still enjoyable, and I think the more you like Springsteen, the more you're going to like this film.  Regardless, I recommend that pretty much everybody out there give this at least one watch.
Melodramatic but that's what wars are about.
So strange, you love it for that fact. Very metaphorical in its message and amazingly acted by its cast.
The Foreigner (2017) is a terrific movie starring Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan.  I do not know how I missed this one when it was released in theaters, or  in the aftermarket, but SHAME ON ME!  This riveting action drama involves Chan's attempt to uncover the splinter IRA operatives that killed his daughter and seek his revenge.  The film is Jackie Chan's answer to Liam Neeson's Taken and Sylvester Stallone's Rambo.   Jackie Chan, after more than 150 films, really hits his acting stride in this one.  He is emotionally engaged and a powerful screen presence; holding his own against Brosnan, a highly skilled actor.  This movie, based on the Stephen Leather book, The Chinaman, was directed by Martin Campbell, who directed 2006's James Bond reboot, Casino Royale.  While this is not a martial arts movie, it is an action film.  Jackie Chan does get the opportunity to showcase his adept stunt and fighting skills in the numerous fighting and chase scenes.  As always his fight scenes are interesting and well-choreographed.  I highly recommend The Foreigner.  It is worth the investment of your time.
Antonio Banderas!  Who knew...
A historical depiction of the events surround a Christmas ceasefire during WWI. I found this film fascinating because we go back and forth between both sides. We switch languages and develop an understanding of what the Scottsh, French, and Germans were going through
Cool action movie definetly
All cuz of Marsha...::Sigh:: still love that woman. :-)
Everybody has a past that they prefer to forget, and some will try to reconstruct their own stories. Here is when Ritesh Batra comes in to reveal the truth to us in this film. Jim Broadbent gives a fine performance as this unreliable narrator.
Absurdly violent, ridiculous and funny at the same time.   A pleasant surprise!
A bit hard to watch. It's disturbing for sure, but not in the way a movie like Hostel is. It's not gore porn...but it is disturbing in its own way.
Clearly a personal project for writer/director/star Chris Rock, Top Five isn't quite a comedy and isn't quite a drama. It nestles snugly, firmly into the in-between, dispensing funny little slices of life alongside serious, self-searching notes about midlife insecurity and the desire to make something more of yourself. Rock basically plays himself, a longtime comedy superstar who worries that his silly wide-appeal earlier works have trapped him in a vicious cycle of self-loathing and alcoholism. His character is grounded and real, afraid to play anything for big laughs because the pressure to meet earlier comedy heights is so crippling. For the most part, it's the story of his swift rapport and burgeoning relationship with a tailing New York Times reporter (Rosario Dawson), which clicks on all cylinders. The two work so well together, it can be enjoyable just watching them interact over the inconsequential, and that's the real draw. Don't go in expecting riotous laughs; it's funny, but also sweet, and an effective stepping stone to broader subjects.
A fantastic, memorable movie with genuine intrigue and suspense until about three quarters in when Chris Hemsworth's character shows up and the whole train comes off the track.
It'd be a run-of-the-mill slasher if it didn't have its fantastically atmospheric effects and its likable characters (Katharine Isabelle is HILARIOUS). The Soska Sisters have done it again.
LOVELY, LOVELY...sweet
This is one of those movies were the critics baffle me. Going by reviews I wasn't expecting much but this movie is great.  You ask yourself real questions of life, ethic, mortality.  Not sure I ever want to bother with a critic that hated this movie. They lack the enjoyment of the existential questions of life.
I Love to watch this Movie
Awesome movie love it
The incredible combination of stunning Monochrome cinematography, darkly disturbing scenes, and impeccable acting makes The Eyes of My Mother a good reminder that the horror genre is still capable of belting out some original and thought provoking films.  This isn't your everyday horror film, I'd your not in to arty films you'll probably fall at the 1st hurdle, and pick out your copy of Friday the 13th. Those that appreciate a slow burning, Andrei Tarkovsky looking film will appreciate it.
A lesser-known gem that is another classic Spaghetti Western about revenge with plenty of shooting and a soundtrack that's almost perfect. It even stood as an example to Tarantino's Kill Bill movies.
Amazing! A fantastic "emotional thriller" highlighting the social, and human limitations. The ratings absollutely make no sense, as if audiences were expecting an action movie rather than a strindberg play. Liv Ullman's adaptation is a tour-de-force, captivating, nerve-wrecking and visually impeccable. The performances of J. Chastain & C. Farrel are superb
One of the best films I have seen in a long time. Good enough to see again. Refreshingly different  and both actors are so in tuned with each other.
I loved the music in this movie!  Looking forward to the soundtrack.  The characters were great, especially the always awesome Malcolm McDowell.  It was so cool to see Samwell from GoT in a completely different role.  Mae Demming as Vic's mom was good.  I'll be getting this one on blu for sure.
Thought it was great! Beautiful scenery even if it wasn’t all real. 
I loved this movie! I cried and laughed and had a great afternoon doing my nails with this flick! I did not like the ending but not all ending can be nice ones or the ones we want. I'm not sure why people didn't like it? Maybe because they expected this happily ever after? I loved it regardless!
Nice Import!  Funny,cute, the cinamtography is breathe-taking!
Best one yet.  I didn't like the rest, to be honest.
Raw, real, sad, excellent performance by Reeves as a stress-laden, perhaps suicidal even fiftysomething.  Rural noir meets Russian mob movie.
MOVIE BASED ON SPARKS BOOKS IS A ROMANCE MOVIE,  IT'S A PLACE WHERE LOVE IS A MYSTICAL FORCE,.. THE TOPIC FOR THE MOVIE IS REMEMBER THE PAST LOVE OR THE YOUNG LOVE AND WHAT HAPPEN IF THEY SAW EACH OTHER AGAIN. THE MUSIC IS PÉRFECT WHEN THE ACTORS MEET AGAIN AND THE ACTORS CHARACTERISTICS ARE PERFECT, THEY TRANSMIT THE FEELINGS IN THE CHARACTERISTICS ARE PERFECT, THEY TRANSMIT THE FEELINGS IN THE MOVIE.
I loved this movie__jackie chan is excellent in spite he is old now
This was excellent. My son's 13th birthday, and I treated myself afterwards to a really fun and engaging Spaghetti Western.
Flew under my radar for 30 odd years, but damn if this isn't one of the most nurturing and delicious things I've ever come across in the romcom department.  Just so much talent, love and care here.
9.0/10 Nothing better than the original. 
This movie really made me laugh.The kid in this movie reminds me of my little brother.i would recommend this movie.
Extremely scary, in a not so scary kind of way. Way deep sht here!
Great insight into the mind...
Great bank robbery movie with plenty of action, although plot could be improved.  Superb acting by Christopher Meloni, Dave Bautista and Johnathon Schaech!
I can't believe this has such bad reviews, I thought it was good, I love all the actors in it. I'm starting to really like Mark Duplass (in real life he's one of the old type liberals, meaning he's sane & not one of the over the top lunatic liberals we see flooding the internet). I've loved Olivia Wilde since watching her on house, she's a very good actor. I also love the guy from Amirican Horror story, Danny Glover I haven't seen much of but what I've seen I'm impressed with.   Bringing people back from the dead & having the experiment go horribly wrong is not a new movie concept but mixing Hell with unlocking the rest of our 90% brain capability, giving telekinesis etc. was nice.   Anyway, it's not half as bad as it's critic score, I may have rated it a little extra just because the other reviews were so bad. Great actors, good plot but fairly thin storyline.
i think is such a pretty movie
I found this movie to be very engaging.  I've struggled with alcoholic friends and the ups and downs are incredibly difficult.  This is the story of how a son went to find his homeless, alcoholic father.
The all the history of one section is put into one story. A very touching Christmas story!
heart breaking. Andrew has such potential - I really liked his spirit.
This was an eye opener. Wow.
Very good story. It could happen to anyone.
I'm unashamed to say that the tears started falling as the story neared its end.  It wasn't until the story was concluding that I realized it was a biopic, which made it even that much more moving... and tear inducing. The acting is superb, especially by Dev Patel and Sunny Pawar who both play Saroo Brierley, an Australian businessman, at two different periods in his life.  Also outstanding as usual is Nicole Kidman as Saroo's adoptive mother.  This is a tale of family lost, family found, and hopefully family found again.  The second half drags just a little spending a little more time than necessary on Saroo's relationship with his girlfriend, but overall a solid A-.
An emotional journey of a broken man who tries to find solace in having dinner with his closest friend. David Oyelowo gives a heartbreaking performance as Peter Snowden, a mentally challenged veteran who served his country that somehow has lost his way. He is filled with an inner rage at how circumstances always seem to be against him. He is living with his mother when something terribly goes wrong, and he begins a narrative to explain himself. He tries desperately to see if his friend from his Army days will come to dinner as his situation has changed now that his mother is not dominating his life. As the narrative unfolds, Pater begins to unravel. When I first started watching this movie, I thought I would not like it but as Peter fills the screen with his longing to be someone that people respect & his need to connect, I can't help but watch. As he talks & explains himself, you begin to empathize with him. When you realize he killed his mother in a fit of rage due what he says is her controlling behavior....you are not surprised. We know he loved his mother but that she could be domineering sometimes, we should be horrified but we find ourselves wanting to know what she must have done to push him to this point. It is this empathy towards his character that whispers to some darkness inside ourselves so we need to know how his journey ends and if he can be salvaged. All I can say is his friend never shows up. Watch it!
Incredibly vibrant, sizzling dialogue and stark violence combined with an intelligent socioeconomic commentary
I thought the film would start with a big flash or something but this film lets you know what you're in for the moment it starts with its very first line and it's awesome, 'Dom Hemingway' is a very fun and unique film with a powerhouse Jude Law performance.   Dom Hemingway is a fascinating character, in the first scene we learn so much about him. What he's like on the outside looks like a front just because of a lack of confidence with himself as we can see from his eyes that he looks very damaged and about to cry at any moment. Maybe I'm wrong but there's a lot more to him and a totally fascinating guy to follow, Jude Law is a total force of nature in this film and truly becomes the character. He put on weight for the role by drinking coke TEN TIMES? But there was a scene where he downs a pint, even though he didn't finish it like I thought he would but you could just tell from Law's eyes that he drank all that for real, he seemed a little queasy. There is a part at the start in prison where you'll think he'll say sorry to the guard because he gave him trouble and then was given some good news but that totally isn't in his character. I do feel bad for the young boy that has to hear everyone's language though but and Dom do have a nice end, although I did wonder why he was by himself but we soon find out who was there. There is another part at Mr. Fontaine's house where you think he'll say sorry just because he went over the line to the people around him but all he says is that he is bored! And even when he has to apologise at one point he does it in his own Dom Hemingway... way.   Richard E. Grant was great but poor Dickie, he had to put up with a lot and even though they argue a lot, you can tell they are close. Jude Law played a Dickie once and now his character has one as a friend, how nice. I was a bit confused when Dickie said 'don't' to when Dom started to smoke, and then he goes and does at the end of the scene, sure that maybe because he doesn't care anymore but I thought we could have seen a reaction, by Dom, at least. I thought the 'don't' was in relation to when Dom said about all the people that get close to him die or lose all their money or the name Dom called his daughter's husband. Demian Bichir was great and while sounding like Javier Bardem, you are never quite sure if you can trust him or not. Despite what you've heard he seems like a nice guy, but of course until Dom provokes him and what they had for dinner that night, jeez. When they meet I expected Dom to say to Mr. Fontaine, 'you're not going to shoot me, right?' I also thought the present Dom brought up would be for his daughter.   I did expect him to say a few things though, when he was in the first place that he goes when he is released from prison, I thought he would yell at all the people watching and the person he punched was pretty much dead anyway. You'd honestly expect him to go back to jail as soon as he got out. When he and Dickie get into an argument, I thought he was going to make a joke about cutting his other hand off. I thought he would yell at the person who was chewing the gum loudly and at the end I expected Dom to say that, ' I'm the fucker who's money you took', as well as shaking that guy's hand. There was one weird part though, at the start when Dom is having his argument with the guard, he says an insult to him and it just lingers on Dom, I thought more was coming. That driving scene was crazy and of course something bad was going to happen! I guess the only real complaint I have is that Dom does say his name quite a lot, and while it makes sense for his character, nearing the end I did start to wonder if the filmmakers were hoping that it was going to become a thing.  The film looks and sounds great, it especially looks a lot different than most English indie flicks seem to. Most English indie flicks seem to have some sort of 'look' to them but this looked like it was made with a huge Hollywood budget. But it also has a distinctive style with title cards, no less; and you can see 'Skyfall' advertised on a bus at some point so you have a rough idea of when what scenes were filmed when, luckily though, that was the only bad part of the film. The film had an outstanding pace and it absolutely flew by so fast, it felt like the film was 5 minutes! This is probably due to the comedy being absolutely hilarious, I was laughing so much that I was in tears and couldn't even hear some of the dialogue just because of how long and how loud I was laughing. I had to rewind and pause many parts of the film just because of how much I was laughing; I haven't laughed that hard in a long, long time. The film does have less laughs near the end but it fits because of the way the story ends up going but it isn't like it forgets the jokes or anything, it is just the film knows when to get serious. The story of the film is quite creative and it moves on to new things quite quickly and I really don't want to spoil it but I love how all the plot points don't seem to have the most satisfying of ends for our lead character, it's different and you understand the point they're trying to get across. Although in the end he meets two characters by a bit of a huge coincidence, in the closing minutes of the film a lot has happened and the ending really has quite a lot of hope and it really got to me.   When the film was playing I just wanted more Dom and I wanted it now, but honestly, I think the filmmakers were smart at keeping this just to an hour and a half. Regardless of that, the response wasn't all that great and the Tomatometer kept going all over the place with this film but I doubt it'll move much from now on. I don't really understand the complaints about, 'oh, he's too unlikeable, so I can't like this film', really? The film is totally crazy and you are warned by its covers, the one with him sitting down especially, and with the great tagline, but he doesn't even sit in that chair at first! 'Dom Hemingway', which is an awesome name, is a blast. I've been meaning to get around to this film for a while and I'm glad that I finally have.
Visually stunning, beautifully told, and magically brought to life!  I grew up on the 1993 adaptation of The Secret Garden and love this film just as much.  It puts a new spin on the classic story.  Colin Firth and Julie Walters deliver quality performances we have come to know them for while young stars Dixie Egerickx and Edan Hayhurst shine as Mary and Colin respectively.  Great family film!  My boys ask to watch it again and again!
very pleased with the movie.
I'm a die-hard fan of animated super hero movies...Justice League; War is amazing...Action packed from beginning to end...And it had seven heroes coming together to do damage...One of the best!
Very funny!! Love it!
An  all    time  classic   in  Indian cinema   just  incomparable
A moving, well-acted movie about a military couple overcoming doubts and fear during difficult times in marriage with a message of courage, faith and hope. The armor of God coin is a reminder of the reality of spiritual warfare and the way to overcome. Enjoyed it very much!
I've been watching Denzel Washington's career since he was on St. Elsewhere. and every new performance of his that I see leaves me more impressed than before, including this one. I loved the plot and the idea that everyone has moments of weakness that one must struggle to overcome, bu the overcoming of them is a triumph, and that every life touches many others in so many ways, that no one lives in isolation, no mate how small their lives seem. Another powerhouse  performance from Denzel Washington.
own this a must see love it
This is how i feel every time im waiting for overtime.
Aww loved loved it!!!!
Huge fan of JLaw - but the story is quite the mind bender if you take the time to think it through. I wonder how many would leave Earth for Homestead II in 2021 - i would.
Loved the storyline and fantastic acting, even though I don't normally like violent films. Brilliant.
Nargis at her best. I love this movie too much. An oscar nominated movie.
Now here is something interesting. An inner city drama dealing with gangs and drugs mashed up with a sci-fi thriller where magic is possible. I didn't have very high expectations going into this film, but I will say that I was somewhat surprised at how good it was. Bo, played very well by Jacob Latimore, is a young man living in LA who is a street magician by day, and a drug dealer by night. He does this to take care of his little sister, Tina (Storm Reid), as both of their parents are deceased.   What are compelling right away are the characters. Jacob Latimore, as I mentioned, does a terrific job playing Bo. We sympathize with Bo, even though throughout the course of the film he is involved in drugs, steals money knowingly from a friend, and even chops a man's hand off. Despite all of this, Bo is convincing as the "good guy." From a broad perspective, he does these things because he is forced to, and if he does not, some way or another he or his sister will end up getting hurt. But what really wins us over is Bo himself; his personality, his characteristics, his compassion, etc., and Latimore takes a lot of credit for making this work. We really feel that he loves his sister, and that he'll do whatever is necessary to care for and protect for. We also feel his compassion and love towards his girlfriend, Holly (Seychelle Gabriel), and there is a really nice moment about halfway through the film where Holly, him, his sister, and his neighbor and "aunt figure" Georgi (Sasheer Zamata) all have dinner together. There is something very nice and intimate about that moment; through all the darkness of the world these characters live in, there is still light.   It is not all light, of course. Angelo (Dulé Hill), Bo's supplier, is generally a nice guy and takes care of Bo. But of course, Bo gets in too deep when he tries to cut some of the money he makes off of drugs for himself to get our of the drug life and move away, and of course, Angelo finds out. So, he kidnaps Bo's sister, and Bo is forced to use his magic in order to rescue her. That's basically what most of the plot summaries say about this film, and I was well aware of that going in. What surprised me is how long they take to get to this main plotline, especially in such a short movie (just under 90 minutes.) This isn't a bad thing; in fact, it's one of the film's many attributes. They take time for the small character moments, one of which I described above, as well as slowing building and winding up the tension instead of simply starting our with a bang like so many of these types of thrillers.   With so many things going right in this film, the only real room for criticism is in its finale, which, yes, feels somewhat rushed and lackluster. It's short and sweet, which is a good thing in some respects, but I can't help but think of this as an engaging and interesting film that builds to an inevitably predictable conclusion. But, when the conclusion still manages to be fairly solid, and the rest of the film does such a great job building tension, developing interesting characters, and has a very unique premise, you still don't walk out feeling unsatisfied or disappointed. Plus, there's a happy ending, which is really nice in this film. Happy endings usually doesn't deserve praise, but this film does a great job with its characters and their relationships that it really earns your happiness, and you will walk out feeling happy too.   -- Rating: 3.5/4
The first in an animated series of DC movies that are actually like movies such as Justice League or other DC movies.
Such a delightful film about the vagaries of the artistic mind and how incomprehensible that mind is to a person who doesn't see with the same vision. Loved it--a real tour d' force of Hammer and Rush playing off one another!
Really good movie. It was 1,000 times better than Obsession with Beyonce. This movie had me going looking to see what happen next. Really didnt like the very ending buy overall it was good. The girl who played Anna Zan Sinclair played that parted she was really good.
Couldn't stop crying. A truly heartbreaking film.
Totally entertaining. Emotional and funny.
Just about the most heartbreaking ever, but good.
An amazing documentary, with very cool stories about a very nice man. Hopefully, we wont find out years from now similar things as we did after the other great Sesame Street documentary, Being Elmo, came out.
Remember 15 years ago at the Meceita ranch? Another time when you took it out on a woman? Unfortunately for you, that woman happened to be my mother.
Very funny. Great actors
There is not much special about this movie, originallity is hard to find and it has a typical western story but still, it has that attractivness that all spaghetti westerns have and I enjoyed every minute of this film!
Amazing life lessons!
I love these French movies. An extremely beautiful story, beautifully shot that should leave a lingering fondness and a lump in the throat long after the credits roll. The  beauty is in the simplicity and power of the story between a naive Arab boy and a mischievous and wild Lila exploring the timeless themes of longing for something unknown and unachievable, losing something that seemed was never there, to the ultimate realisation of having attained true love which transcends social boundaries. Vahina is mesmerising as Lila. The script is almost poetic in its crudeness but French movies
The acting, the relevancy, & the history all come together to create a cohesive, and utterly disturbing historical piece.   Based on the real-life research of Dr. Zimbardo (who was a consultant on the film), The Stanford Prison Experiment is a dramatic period piece that remains relevant over 40 years later.  It's hard to put something like this into words when it is so scary, because this is something that really happened. I remember around my sophomore year of high school, I actually learned about the Stanford Prison Experiment through my Biology teacher. It spiked a lot of interest to me, but I never bothered to look into it. In 2015, this film was released. About two years later, I finally saw this movie, and I just wish I had seen it sooner.   One thing that really stood out to me was the acting. For me, there were a ton of recognizable faces in this film, but none were really that mainstream. A ton of these guys have played smaller roles in films that I recognized, but they all did a fantastic job here. Uniformly, everyone put together a really consistent act and they really sold the fear of being a part of this experiment. I think one of the things that can drive fear into your heart is seeing the deathly fear on someone else's face. I think the scariest thing is not having power, and not being able to help yourself, and they really showcased that fear in this film, with the performances being a strong example of that.   I feel like if you had never heard about this experiment prior, this film will be a great historical piece for you. It's definitely not a documentary, but it surely feels like a realistic historical piece with a documentary-esk twist to it. It feels like you're really in this situation with these people and I feel like I not only learned a lot about this experiment, but what the experiment was meant to teach us.   Like a lot of films, this one addresses the topic of humanity, and what one person will do when given the power of authority. Everyone starts out kind of giggly, as they know it's not a real prison. The 'guards' chuckle at procedures, and the 'inmates' tolerance is low, since they believe they still have power. However, you see this really quick transformation and you see just how mean and vile people can be. These were your everyday, ordinary civilians. They were people like you and I. So if the concept of authority can take over their mind so easily, what do you think it could do to us?  In the end, this was a fantastic and powerful film. It's definitely one I think you shouldn't miss, especially with it being streamed on Netflix. It's also relevant to some events that are happening in today's time, so definitely give it a watch.
I cared so much for Collin, rooting for him within minutes. Touched on many important  issues with sensitivity and humor.  Keeps you riveted from the get go.
This movie is cheesy but in a good way. Lots of laugh out loud moments. This is a movie is definitely a guilty pleasure.
Washington gets better with age. He always plays interesting parts and this was no exception. He played a lawyer who had to overcome adversity in order to survive. The social justice the character was raised on was part of his core who could not and would not let leave that core. The movie also was a reflection of how a person with those ideals always will struggle because it's not the norm to stand up to them and in the end can corrupt ones view of social justice when you come back to participate in surrounding life. I could see his character in myself. He was the person who believed in the law but could not put himself in the position of working in the courts. I think it corrupted his mind and perhaps he was like an idiot savant or had asbergers. He was obviously very smart. I thought it was a wonderful character he played and the story was about how he navigated the world and the adversity he faced all around him. I have yet to see one movie Denzel has done I didn't like. I admire his skill and personality he brings to his characters.I am surprised more people didn't appreciate the story and acting. I would probably watch this another 15 times. What's not to like about overcoming adversity.
better than expected.kind of a cruel intentions imitation
The Devil's Candy is a modern horror masterpiece. The film is smart and unsettling. Ethan Embry deserves major praise for such a drastic physical transformation and convincing performance. Easily one of the best horror films of the decade.
Mehboob Khan's epic tells a dynamic presentation of post-independence, post-colonial issues of India. With stellar and memorable performances by Nargis, Raaj Kumar, and Sunil Dutt, "Mother India" is a Bollywood zeitgeist that can be looked back on as a reminder of exceptional filmmaking and the predestined strives of life - and especially those of a "mother."
This movie was terrific! Great acting! Great direction and script!
a super-smart meta-western . shot to perfection
I loved this movie. At first I thought it would just be some bad gritty reboot. And as a long time fan of the show was not something I wanted to see. But it blew my mind by actually being good. The fight scenes are awesome. The character development and acting is incredibly underrated I actually believed I was watching a team of teenagers that were all completely different but had found a way to come together and grown stronger as a team. I just loved watching them unite and by the end it felt like they truly cared for each other and had become real friends.
What a lovely and sad movie
A very touching movie. If you really watch it you wiI'll figure out what happens. A beautiful movieyes.
I can't believe how little known this film is!! After A few dollars more it is my favourite western. Lee Van Cleef is badass as normal and I'm sure some of the score was in Kill Bill. A must see if you like westerns!!
Will appeal more to Springsteen fans than non-fans, but the mix of humor and serious topics, plus teen romance are handled very well. The father of the hero's family deserves a supporting actor nomination, too: brilliant portrayal of a first generation immigrant patriarch.
Absolutely best contemporary western.
A beautiful documentary about the man behind the feathers of one of my favorite characters. The film gives us a front row seat to the creative process, the relationships, and most importantly, the mind and soul of Big Bird's creator. Beautiful.
Brilliant clever smart funny film ever made.
A great love story for everyone!
Engaging story, with raw emotion on a sensitive subject. Gives some insight to what parents might go through emotionally when they have lost a child.
Powerful and emotionally evocative. It's a compelling,  fascinating, and true story of a boy who got lost and years later tried to find his way home. We often get caught up in our First World problems. We could all benefit from occasionally taking note of Third World problems, and of the universality of strong family bonds throughout the World. A must see film, especially if you liked Slumdog Millionaire (Dev Patel starred in both). The 8 year old actor Sunny Pawar was amazing. Nicole Kidman was heartbreakingly real.
I actually really enjoyed this film
A lesser-known gem that is another classic Spegetti Western about revenge with plenty of shooting and a soundtrack that's almost perfect. It even stood as an example to Tarantino's Kill Bill movies.
Based upon the true story of Army chaplain Darren Turner about the realities of the faith, sacrifice, life, and death in the Iraq War.  Talented actors, balanced script about the families at home coping, and of the soldiers deployed off at war.  
Flaw: could use more humor, more running time.
Its a great movie really funny i enjoyed it alot i recom
I’m not a scary movie type of guy. For 1 hour and 25 minutes, I felt this movie could have gone a bit longer due to the fact that some scenes were left out. It’s not as scary as I thought it will be. Based on the ending of this film, I highly doubt there will be sequel and if there is, I hope it will be better and scarier 
positive film  don't forget ya tissues tho â~
A loving friendship with a corpse. The concept alone is far-fetched, but this movie did it and succeeded. Dano and Radclliffe are superb and the music would put a smile on my face every time. It's definitely not for everyone. I didn't even expect to like it that much, but I wound up loving it.
Laugh out loud hilarious!  MOONWALKERS is the first funniest movie of this year even though we just started on 2016 but I'm confident enough to shout that aloud because it really is going to be tough for other comedy films from this point forward to top MOONWALKERS. It's so outrageously funny, you're going to be gasping for air from laughing too hard.  Written by Dean Craig and directed by Antoine Bardou-Jacquet, the legendary Ron Perlman plays an unstable CIA agent, he's a Vietnam war vet suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, but he's been assigned by the agency to locate and hire filmmaker Stanley Kubrick so that Kubrick would film a fake moon landing just in case America's actual moon landing fails. One unsuccessful rock band manager (Rupert Grint) and his confused friend (Robert Sheehan) see this as an opportunity. But things get complicated.  It's part con man comedy, it's part gangster comedy, MOONWALKERS is basically something that Guy Ritchie would concoct back in the day. And on top of that, the story is set in a psychedelic era, so it adds to how fun and unpredictable MOONWALKERS can get, you see these characters who are in way over their heads, and a war vet who's just aching to unleash his frustrations. It's a comedy that relies on mistaken identity, misunderstanding, and ignorance, MOONWALKERS doesn't try too hard to make you laugh because the characters themselves are already doing a fantastic job at that. Well-written, well thought out and well-acted, Rupert Grint and Robert Sheehan have excellent comedic timing, Perlman's take no-prisoner-approach is entertaining. I haven't laughed this hard since 2007's "Death At a Funeral," it's good to have that feeling back.  Please read more at www.ramascreen.com
i proud on indian mother's
Good movie forma he romantic movies fans
I have no idea why this movie was rated so low. I saw a higher rating on another website and decided to give this one a shot. I wasn't disappointed. I have the audible book so I am familiar with the story and characters. Really liked it too. I was excited to see the movie adaptation and wasn't disappointed in any way. The movie IMO was very faithful to the book, characters, storyline. I enjoyed seeing Hercule Poirot portrayed on the big screen with all his mannerisms and accent. Very entertaining! There was enough suspense, action, and crime solving to engage almost any movie audience. Highly recommend it!
I saw it last night.I like it alot really good movie!!
On a favorite movies
Classic Costner. Good suspense and action.
Great fantastic crazy movie starring some kids who are amazing and some old people who are just as amazing. I love horror movies especially during Halloween season and this movie came me the chills that I wanted plus so much more. This movie is great and yeah it doesn't have the best twist in the world it's still very good and m night Shyamalan has done it again.
It's a rly good movie and very inspirational for single fathers.
Director and writer Jim Jarmusch at his best, a seemingly trivial and glancing examination of a Paterson, New Jersey  bus driver also named Paterson whom we get watch as he goes about his day, waking up next to his   wife, clocking into work, driving his route around the downtown area (it seems), listening to rich chunks of fascinatingly inane small talk from his passengers and, most telling, having lunch. Paterson the driver, living in Paterson the city, echos the legacy of Paterson the epic poem by William Carlos Williams, the great American poet and and a Paterson native son. Paterson, the driver,  writes poetry on his lunch break, and in the course of the film viewers have the only film about a poet I remember that showed the writing process in effective movie terms. The poem, in the driver's hand writing, appears on the screen as he composes and we listen to the poem in his voice being created; revisions are made, lines and words crossed out, new phrases are introduced, what begins as seemingly prosaic and ordinary becomes something extraordinary , worh noticing, an idea beautifully expressed and preserved in words. This is the beauty of Jarmusch at  his best, finding rich and resonating veins from the   everyday, bits of modern life uncluttered and made just slightly odd. Humorous, touching, perfectly disarming , this movie is also particularly in small pleasures that are matter of fact,   bits of surprise with no fanfare, one of which    is that the Paterson the driver/character living in a city named Paterson which is also the title of an important American poem is portrayed by Actor Adam Drive. Intended  or by coincidence, I think  that is very, very cool  in a satisfying small way.
In a time when movies pander to least common, brain-dead denominators, Denzel and the movie aspire to much greater.  People who think will appreciate it.  People who aren't interested in thinking won't.  This is a movie with compassion, heart and soul.
Though a story we've heard before, and a script that's even less enjoyable, it still proves to be a kid only for kids, but not for adults. Jackie Chan's charm is not enough to save the film from a rather boring script, dialogue that is not very enjoyable, and some of the weirdest acting by the younger stars of this movie. But, despite the movie's flaws, the Jackie Chan action sequences though are obviously choreographed, still show that a man of Jackie Chan's age can still be enjoyed by everyone, just not the film in general. Certainly not a good movie, but hey, could have been a lot worse.
pleasantly surprised with this silly comedy. liked the unlikely friendship that develops between the 3 women. the guy that plays their not so significant other is bland. and a couple of grossout scenes that I could of done without.
I expected this to be really bad...and it was. However, I've seen some of the other crappy movies made by the same writers of this one and at I can say this one was somewhat watchable. There are some parts that are kind of funny, but nothing that made me laugh out loud.   The thing I hate most is that these guys have a bad habit of shoehorning anything from pop culture into these films. They also tend to blatantly point out what they are referencing - I guess in case the audience is too stupid to recognize it. These guys are capable of creating some funny moments, but they really need to have some quality writers/directors to reel in the painfully unfunny stuff.
Swiss Army Man is not dissimilar to those 1960s/70s classics your mother might be likely to show you, in the way that you might enjoy it or you might not, but whether you do or don't it's a must-watch due to its sheer originality and boldness.
It's a tired plot of who can you trust.
The first part of the movie is very entertaining, learning about the ship they are stranded on, their adventures, etc.  Then, as was inevitable, the romance starts and the movie takes a steep dive off a high cliff.  By the time, again inevitably, the crisis aboard the ship happens, I was hoping for both of them to die.  The movie is very predictable.
was average...even the acting. denzels been much better.
Biggie Cheese singing Mr. Bombastic is the best thing ever and also you can tell that this movie's aged very badly, when Otis is using a fucking flip up phone.
Based on a novel by H. G. Wells
I love old exploitation biker movies and this one tries to be one. It had great potetial and I was excited to see it. Then I was so let down. This movie can really be summed up by those who rated it lower than me.
It had a terrific premise, wonderful concept but let itself down with no real action, character development and oh dear, yawn of an expected middle. An Ad Astra Zzzzz.... a shame with a great cast and if written properly a hell of a potential script.
A good horror sequel, but it is still a rather routine slasher that has some above average aspects about it...
I really wanted to like this movie because I am a fan of most of these actors. But it was boring and way too long.
Remember liking this movie as a kid. Hadn't seen it since so decided to buy it from a going out of business Blockbuster for 2 bucks. The dynamic between the characters seemed a little forced..and not very believable. It has it's moments that are moving and make you think (the part where DeVito meets his son)  but the overacting and lack of chemistry between the characters made me not care as much.
Awful story. Made no sense whatsoever and completely unoriginal. However, it was incredibly well produced and brilliant acting.
It's okay when you're 8 years old, but only a few brief moments in this movie are funny as an adult
tolerable love triangle
The first act is REALLY boring and pointless. I missed the second act, the third act is awesome though. They're surrounded by dogs dressed as killer shews!
I guess I will never find out if "Playtime" is a masterpiece or not, as I had to give up after 40 minutes watching it. I admit it was a very interesting creation slash world slash setting. A marvelous playground, in which I coun't find the will to play, nor to give my time to.
A character driven mystery film where behind every wall in this mysterious hotel is a dark past waiting to come out. Even with an all star cast, this film lacks a lot of substance. I feel there is too much going on and not enough time to focus on outside characters the audience wants to get to know more of. The film itself is shot well and is probably its strongest asset. This film is a bit of a drag at times and could have benefitted more with a better character driven story.
weirdish.. not scary
Stick to the classic.
This felt like a made for tv movie. Kinda corny and slow moving. I almost fell asleep halfway through it. Disappointed to say the least. 
Didn't enjoy this movie with Ashley Judd-though I think she is a fine actress.
A bit slow and complex for me to follow but I enjoyed this film
What the flip? What kind of kids movie did I just watch? I was legit bored throughout this entire movie. The beginning I paid attention and made this a super depressing kids movie. I would never show my kid this. I would rather show my kid pattington. 
Jackie's getting old :( And its starting to show. But he is still excellent and this movie is a nice family movie
just a OK film to me...
The first one was OK but this is totally bogus. and its not even the final sacrifice... one or two humorous scenes make this a 2 otherwise this would have gone straight to hell
This one had me, and then the ending was horrible.
Movie was a bit meh but got better towards the end. 
Do you believe in happy endings?  In the same vein as The Fisher King (which you can find in F section), but not quite as heartwarming, funny, intelligent, or good.   The Story: A homeless man holds a Harvard students thesis hostage for food and a place to eat. Of course it's as predictable as they come, the student learns that there's more to life than graduating with honors, and the homeless man turns out to be the unlikely teacher of this valuable life lesson. It's not really stylish, it looks pretty generic and the camera movement isn't anything spectacular, the humor is fairly generic as well, and the characters often times seem pretentious along with the loads of "intelligent" dialogue.   The Cast: Joe Pesci, Brendan Fraser...Brendan Fraser is Monty, his only goal in life is to graduate from Harvard with honors, hence the title of the film. He doesn't give a bad performance, but he really doesn't give a great performance either. He's sort of middle of the road here, fans of his might be a little more forgiving, but people that aren't fans aren't going to find themselves saying "damn! I've gotta see more of this fine young actor!". Joe Pesci, is Simon, the homeless man with the heart and soul of a poet. His lines usually make him sound conceited and snobbish. He's like the male version of Rosie O'Donnel, only he uses big words. Sorry Pesci fans, you're better off watching just about anything else he's done, this is not his finest hour.   One to Five Scale: 2   Go watch The Fisher King instead, it's much much better. Even the most hardcore Fraser and Pesci fans will have a hard time watching this boring film.   Tyler
It sucks for the most part with some good parts thrown in for density.
This movie has 2 essential problems: pacing and the writer's unclear understanding of her own protagonist and antagonist.  The first issue is apparent from the first minute of the movie, and little else needs to be said; the problem is never overcome.  The acting is beautiful, but at times, Ms. Jolie's acting is indicated, likely as a function of her playing too many roles in the creation of the film... as such, it stands in contrast to that of the other actors who carry the film.  But as to the second problem: The film's real protagonist is Jolie herself, the antagonist being grief, the ubiquitous and cruel monster hiding in the closet.  But as a writer, she tries to be too clever, giving the audience a series of red herrings regarding the cause of her behavior and the demise of the marriage for her spouse.  What results, however, is removing the audience from sympathy with her (or at least in time to attach to her vulnerability), and causing the audience to go up into their own cognitive experiences of wondering what on earth is happening... rather than simply experiencing that grief and pain WITH her, which she very much deserves, but which is kept from the audience until the last 10 minutes... and it is a SLOW RIDE to those 10 minutes. So much so that you don't much care when she finally gets there in her storytelling.  Jolie is talent, every which way you look, but when she thinks she is above or forgets the basics of good storytelling and good movie making, in an effort to be "artsy," she is her own greatest barrier.
It's all downhill after the giant chickens...
better than expected. a typical hollyood-relationship comedy. c it if you wanna pass ur time
If you want light confection to while away an hour and a half then this is fine.
so, so, so sad.. and poor ending.. i cant believe that this was nominated for oscar...
Law did a great job acting, but the film wasn't that good.
Its promising premise and excellent cast are squandered in a mediocre comedy with an uneven tone, underdeveloped characters and humor that, while sometimes hilarious, for the most part it's too gross-out to stick the landing.
Where is the climax? Alex' laugh is the only look-like-climax i could notice.
Joe dirt is a pretty mediocre comedy movie. For me personally there was some laughs but not nearly enough. Some of the jokes here in my opinion just aren't funny. This is one of Happy Madison's worst movies in my opinion. I didn't hate this film I just Walsh it was better than it was. Overall Joe dirt is a lazy comedy that just isn't funny enough to enjoy it. Grade C
Still looking for the twistiness.
It seemed rushed and unfinished like the bully seemed undeveloped and had one scene and the chase scene was all cartoon.
I thought this would be sexy and dark but it's like a wooden PG 13 movie. It has Snoop Dogg! Where's all the fucks and fucking?
Sex Tape was a strange movie and by far not my favorite product of Jason Segal. It was weird and awkward to watch with a poor story line that leaves you saying that was bad.
How is this rated so high?! It could’ve been a great movie, but it was some scenes that didn’t make any sense. 
Felt weird. Choices were made? Not so sure. Weak script, weak directing... The actors did what they could with what they had.
While it has some great moments, and Robert De Niro and Edgar Ramirez are great in this movie, Hands Of Stone is, unfortunately, one of the most unfocused and predictable boxing films I've ever seen this year!
Steel sucks, but is so over the top it can be enjoyable at times.
Very predictable and lame. It lacks the horror aspect most likely due to the poor performances and cliche witch curse.
At least is not boring... however, good it isn't. Despite the cast having fun, specially Arnie, recovering his comedic timing.
Even though the movies are *based* on the book series, this one didn't respect the book at all...  First, John's character was played by someone that doesn't resemble the one on the book, which is really frustrating (even though I like the actor). Second, *SPOILER ALERT* the coolest part or the book is the tag game and it was just removed. Plus, Stormy's character doesn't resemble the (best) character on the book/series as well, which is  shame. The USO party is amazing as well.  And overall the movie is kinda forced to be way too much romantic, even more than the book. I guess if I hadn't read the books I'd be more satisfied,  but this one is so forced I got diabetes from its over sugared plot. I watched the first movie several times and this one I won't bother watching the second for it is  waste of time. It is so sad! hopefully the last one will be better. Ah. Curiously I liked very much the Genevieve-LJ arc and Both Trina and Stormy actresses as well.
messed up but in am interesting way
Infuriatingly bad watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.  It's like someone wanted "Barry" and "The Office" to be the same thing, but they couldn't get a name big enough except for Arnold Schwarzenegger who looks awesome in this, so why wouldn't he take the pay check.  And I like almost everyone in this movie, Arnold included, they're really funny people, and I bet this movie was a blast to make.  However, this movie is a fine example of what NOT to do for found footage, and why making a "fake-umentary" is so hard to do correctly.  Unfortunately, these comedy actors are mostly sketch artists (SNL) or they work parts on sitcoms, Hannah Simone was the "best friend" on "New Girl", but other than Taran Killam (arguably), they haven't carried a show before, and I don't think they realized that making a movie isn't the same as making episodes.  I would love to see all these people back together in a good movie, but the writing in this movie is heavily dependent on weak characters with soft motivations, and a lot, A LOT, of attention seeking humor (basically the movie demands you watch it, "Look at me dad! Dad!  YOU'RE NOT LOOKING!"), or situational humor, which takes a LOT of work to either set up or explain.  I was really looking forward to this one, which might be why I'm being so critical, because it is a GREAT premise, but they didn't take writing the script seriously because it's a comedy so they loss some of the "oomph" and draw it should have had.  And there are few physics breaking things that I wouldn't have cared about so much, but the rest of the movie was grating at me that it didn't care, so I shouldn't care.  I'm not mad in the end, I'm just disappointed.
Please prepare, at best, for a gloomy feeling that lingers way beyond the end of the film. For a person that yearns "magic" this simply didn't deliver - there are some nice special effects that bring the garden to life, but nothing breathtaking. Two of my favourites Julie Walters & Colin Firth remain - if you can imagine - like fabulous ballons that never actually get inflated. Worse still there's no feeling of rapport at all between the children?, nothing, I felt nothing? All tributes in this film go to the beautiful dog, I've awarded the stars just for him - I would have given more but I didn't want to mislead anyone into thinking they were for the film. In all honesty, it's taken a couple of sing-along Abba songs, a slice of Black Forest Gateau and a speed walk round the block (it's a very small block) to get over the disappointment, in the words of the wise and wonderful Hyacinth Bucket ..."you shouldn't tamper with a winning system" and the original(1993) was indeed a winner!
The film borders on the melodramatic for way too long, 2 hours by count. I liked the actors and the depth they bring to the film but the filmmaking is forced. You are constantly provided with flashbacks of everything you have seen and that's when he is losing the fight. I have seen pretty much every boxing movie and sadly this misses beats left, right and centre. The writing seems strong so my best guess is the editing where the film seems to have lost its strength.
The one good thing to come out of this slow, uneventful, and downright boring drama is Denzel Washington's magnetic performance.
The film features a interesting story and decent performances, but then the cliches pile on.  It's story and predictable and with a bigger budget and script might have been something special.
It was ok. Killed some time and i don't regret watching it, but it wasn't great. Certainly no homage to the original series.
It doesn’t feel like it should be that difficult to make a solid inspirational football film. There are plenty of them out there already, and the sport is rife with possibilities for big moments. I’m also a big fan of football, so I’m inclined to enjoy any movie that focuses on it. That’s why it puzzles me when I watch a movie like When the Game Stands Tall, and feel so bored. For starters, we’re talking about a movie that STARTS with a coach that has managed to lead his high school team to an impressive 151-game winning streak over the span of a decade. Yet our story won’t be about the momentous record, instead it will be about the kids who lost in order to end the streak. You’d think any good screenwriter would find out about this kind of success, and want to build a movie around that. Instead they start with a team that’s already on top, and expect us to care when they fall from grace. But there’s still something to work with in this concept, because the movie knocks them down at the start, and you can make a decent story about a group of losers who have to crawl their way back. Even though I thought the choice of when to set the film was stupid, it still could have worked. The problem is they don’t do a good job of creating characters to root for in When the Game Stands Tall. We get to meet some of the players, but I never felt they allowed us to connect with any of them enough to care about their journey. Some of them have little subplots, but I wasn’t interested in most of them, and I don’t think they did a good job of connecting their stories off the field to their play on the field (aside from one kid looking to set a record, because they had to hammer that one home a ton.) It seems the movie has some slight grounding in faith or religion because we hear scripture referenced a few times. This is ironic since the movie seems to worship the coach Bob Ladouceur with much greater reverence than Jesus. The coach is raised up on a pedestal, and treated as some type of idol. It’s too bad that Jim Caviezel appears so disinterested in his performance. I don’t know if the real coach is super mellow and Caviezel was trying to match his demeanor, but I swear he looked as bored as I was with the film. I always get pumped up for some good football scenes, so there was some fun to be had with When the Game Stands Tall, but otherwise it was overly bland.
i guess since WWF had let him go at this time and he hadn't been signed by WCW yet so i guess he needed a quick payday. not a bad movie though
I know that the things that suck about Tone-Deaf are the point of Tone-Deaf, but I don't know if that makes them any more acceptable.
"Better on pages, Then on screen"  The Long Haul felt like a rushed film. The new cast just didn't rightly fit in the shoes of the characters well. The jokes was all based on toilet humor, and it ruined the first three films. Not much fun to watch.
Swiss Army Man is not an easy film to digest...ehem. It starts weird and proceeds to get weirder. It's fun in parts and better in hindsight, as you forget the self-indulgence. A flatulent film, which was hardly a gas.
The movie started off great but really went down hill in the half. Final act was terrible. in like lion, out like a lamb.
Filled with the expected camp values and 1950s B-movie cliches but it's a bit boring. Clocking at a mere 70 minutes, the film never gets too boring but it pales in comparison to its double bill fellow and Ray Kellog directed, The Killer Shrews.
Just an average thriller with little thrills.....too much screen time for Houston whose acting is wanting.
A run of the mill biopic. DeNiro, Barkin and Turturro add some class, but it plays out like all your average sport films.
In the movie, The Titan, the characters' undergo a completely untested procedure to transform them into people who can survive in the otherwise hostile environment of Saturn's moon. because the Earth is about to become uninhabitable, an experimental scientist uses desperate science to inadvisably alter these people.  The movie shows several steps in the transformation while [Worthington's] doctor wife shows actual doctoral clout, and it all gets progressively more fascinating, until the people are fully transformed.
While it offers some good acting and good looking special effects, Sleight is one of those films that tries to be like Chronicle, but falls short, and it also ended up being a dull, cliched, and predictable mess.
As soon as the name Bert I. Gordon flashed across the screen, I knew I was in for something bad.  Swarms of badly-superimposed giant wasps, a man fighting a giant rooster in a barn, terrible acting...I found myself wondering just why this film had never appeared on MST3K.  (The "giant cock" jokes alone kept my friends and I rolling though most of the film.)  And then I found out.  There are "giant" rats in this movie, which are portrayed in turns as either hand puppets, or shots of real rats next to tiny models.  Numerous of these "giant" rats got shot, but in most of those scenes, it was the normal-sized rats that took the brunt of it.  At first, I thought they were just being hit with paint pellets or something, but as the movie went on, I got the sinking feeling that the filmmakers were actually killing these rats just to make a movie.  Especially judging from the way some of them flew after being shot, and the fact that there was no disclaimer saying "no animals were harmed during the making of this film" at the end.  Whether they were killing these animals or not, the presumption that they were really ruined my enjoyment of this film.  If the entire thing had kept with the harmless cheese of the giant rooster fight, the b-movie lover in me would have probably given this 4 stars or so, for the riffing factor alone.  But every time a rat got shot, the animal lover in me felt disgusted.
Right from the start when you walk into a theatre to watch a film like this one , you know it's going to be so over the top & shameless it will at least be fun! Well this film is far from being a masterpiece but i found it very fun to watch, well paced and Milla Jovovitch is very nice to look at. an incredible B movie to watch with friends and a keg of beer or high as a kite.... only ways to fully enjoy the joke!
Routine Spaghetti Western.  Roger Ebert's 1969 review includes this canny observation: "Van Cleef's face, in closeup, has the lean, hardened, embittered expression of a man who has either (a) been pursuing his lonely vengeance across the plains of the West for 30 years, or (b) realizes he will be making spaghetti Westerns the rest of his life."
Pretty Average Film. Very Long Winded.
Berk's movie is too plodding and predictable to generate anything more than a modest level of suspense; worse, it lacks enough excitement to qualify even as instantly forgettable popcorn entertainment.
heinously brilliant.
Watchable but the last third is pretty much garbage that makes little sense of what we have seen before...(this could have been a fantastic movie if they had let the wife be the one that caused the move...)
Isn't it good (not really) to go down memory lane to a time when young mysitical (not really) has to use his special sauce to help his burger joint beat the new rival burger resturant in his town.  Sinbad makes an appearance in the movie you may get stupider watching.  talking hamburgers and mistaking babies for basketballs in 90's nickelodean tv show feature film.
had hbo in the background, this was showing.  got me into it a little bit then got very bored.
Review: This is a very basic movie about an elderly couple, played my Morgan Freeman and Diane Keaton, who have decided to sell there apartment in New York after living there for 40 years. With the stairs becoming hard to handle because of there age, they hire an agent who gets clients to come to see there apartment and there's soon a bidding war between various parties. With there dog in hospital and the troubles of finding another apartment, there love is still as strong as ever and they soon realise that there is no reason why they have to make such a drastic move. The chemistry between Freeman and Keaton was brilliant and it's about time that Hollywood made an elderly film about an multi racial couple. The problem that I found with the film was that the concept seemed to go round and round in circles and nothing major really happened throughout the film. It was nice watching how close the couple was after so many years but for entertainment, I found it quite dull. I can't say a bad word about the performances, which were extremely believable but I must admit, I did get a bit bored after a while. Anyway, it's worth a watch just to see these two veteran actors side by side but it dries up very quickly. Average!  Round-Up: Morgan Freeman, 78, has really done it all in his long movie career which started on a TV series called Another World in 1964. Although he has starred in many movies, he really came to light after his performance as a high school teacher in Lean On Me in 1989. Straight after that, Driving Miss Daisy came out and there was no turning back for Freeman after that. He lost out to Daniel Day-Lewis for the Academy Award in a leading role category in 1990 but he became a household name with movies like Glory, Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves, Unforgiven, Shawshank Redemption, Outbreak, Se7en, Amistad, Bruce Almighty, Million Dollar Baby, the Bucket List and the Batman franchise. His unique voice and calm demeanour put him in the same category of classic actors like Clint Eastwood and Jack Nicholson and his subtle style really worked in this movie alongside Diane Keaton, who isn't looking bad at 69. After starring in the multi award winning Godfather movies, Keaton chose to stick to light comedies like Baby Boom, the Father of the Bride franchise, First Wives Club, Somethings Gotta Give, the Family Stone and the many movies that she starred in, alongside Woody Allen which include the famous Manhattan. Together, these actors showed natural professionalism in this movie and the director Richard Loncraine, chose the actors well. After directing Wimbledon, Richard III with Ian McKellen, Firewall with Harrison Ford and My One and Only with Renee Zellweger, he could have done a better job with the storyline because it's not every day that you can get Morgan Freeman on board. With that aside, it is short and sweet and the chemistry was top form.  Budget: $1million Worldwide Gross: $2million  I recommend this movie to people who are into their emotional dramas about an elderly couple who are trying to sell there apartment in New York. 4/10
Not scary, boring and dumb.
misogynist bullshit. that lying psychopath would have been lying in a pool of his own blood had he touched a feather on my canary's head. then i'd stick the notes (money) in his packets and i'd cry "rape". problem solved. the problem with this movie wasn't the acting but the content.
While the old school Slasher approach (very reminiscent of halloween 2) is not entirely unenjoyable, See No Evil 2 is disappointingly by the books and considering its talented directors this sequel (aside from the rather twisty and effective climax) is somewhat forgettable.
Not great. Was expecting a lot after I saw the reviews. Average western.
Too Many Plot Hole's, Was Filmed In SF....
Tabloid reporter and squabbling teen son arrive in Gatlin for a story after fifty adults are found dead.  Local children unite in a corn field to do the wishes of he who walks behind the rows.  Feel good ending sees teen telling dad he's alright.
Lacks sensibility and development, sort of just happens....and happens poorly.
Recycles all the regeneration genre's greatest hits.  Cast is great does what it can with what they had.
Like many English dramas "The Sense of an Ending" start off slow, takes it time getting to the pay-off while giving you time to get to the know the characters. Unfortunately there are too many characters in the past, the 20+ year olds of today's 60+ year olds that look too much alike without enough emphasis on their names to keep them straight. This becomes very important when the denouement is made.  The film is a look at meditation, memory and aging basically about what we remember and what really took place. We follow Tony Webster-a very solid performance by Jim Broadbent-who is taken back to the past by an unexpected notice that he has received a bequest involving money and a diary from a friend at collage from 40 years ago who committed suicide.    Tony is divorced, owns a very small camera shop and has a lesbian daughter about to give birth without a partner. He is friendly with his ex, played by Harriet Walker and attends breathing classes and is in attendance when the daughter, played by Michelle Dockery, gives birth.  Tony as a young man, played by Billy Howle, has a puppy love crush on Veronica, played by Freya Mavor, who will only go so far sexually with him. He spends a weekend with her family including Veronica's mother, Emily Mortimer, father, played by James Wilby and brother played by Edward Holcraft. He, also, has a strong attraction to classmate                                                                                                           Adrian Finn, played by Andrew Buckley. Veronica later pairs up with Adrian and Tony sends her a vicious  letter which the now older Veronica, played by Charlotte Rampling, shows to Tony and telling him that she burned the diary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This leads up to the denouement which became more of a mystery to me and others I spoke to in the theatre auditorium afterwards.  "The Sense of an Ending" is a quiet, slow movie with many flashbacks that only confuses the narrative. Though the flashbacks are themselves easy to follow it is those cast in the younger roles, mainly the 5 males that make for the confusion. Also, and this may or may not be a spoiler, who are the parents of the child, not the lesbian's child, which is a pivotal point of the whole film  The Sense of an Ending Trailer  Like many English dramas "The Sense of an Ending" start off slow, takes it time getting to the pay-off while giving you time to get to the know the characters.

Strong acting make this an interesting enough exploration of the artists method, his craft and his indifference/contempt for his subject. The problem is that you dont really get invested in either one.
Despite the best efforts of a solid and diverse cast, The Lazarus Effect falls flat due to a massively predictable story and cheap, ineffective scares
One of those movies that I watch no matter how bad it is
AFter two hours we find out why this couple is so self-destructive and ruined: The Mrs. is "barren".  Is that all? OK, she's also depressed, presumably because she's "barren".  It's a good looking movie but the two leading actors seem to be perpetually hung over and lacking in all energy. I suppose she can do nothing but lay around due to her "barrenness" which saps all the energy out of her and the movie. Besides which the intro and outro music is super annoying ... Not much happens other than their spying on their neighbors and fighting. I really thought Vanessa was dying or something, but she eventually makes it clear that being "barren" is a fate worse than death. Spoiler alert: it's dull and mopey and the worst vacation by a couple that can't have any fun other than a card game ever filmed. Oh yeah, a bit of bathtub sex while Mr. apparently has his pants on. Lots of unnerving and silent staring by Mrs. Mopey. Did she forget to write lines for herself?
Good acting, but slow pace, clichéd/stereotypical/racist "smart black kid has to resort to selling drugs to get by" plot, and really frustratingly poor understanding of basic science. Spoiler - he doesn't have powers, even if that's what the trailer wants you to think.
Another unnecessary film. Okay, so the idea of having a guy running around in (what was it? 75 lbs?) armor, saving the world by ridding it of evil people may be something simple enough to chew on. But boy does this movie stink. The acting is horrible. And I mean HORRIBLE. The best actor was the dog. And the minor references to Shaq's free throws are just lame. It starts on a low note, and ends off pretty much the same. In fact, the whole script was lame. There are even awkward pauses after these lame jokes, when I think the audience is supposed to laugh. But it didn't exactly work. STEEL is lucky enough to have been made in the past. If we had a superhero movie like that NOW...I think the popcorn should cost more than the ticket.
A very forgettable boxing film, with a below average performance from Robert De Niro and an okay performance from Usher. Edgar Ramirez is fantastic as Roberto Duran and makes this movie watchable. Poorly written characters and okay boxing sequences make this movie what it is.
The Other Woman(2014) Starring:Cameron Diaz,Leslie Mann,Kate Upton,Don Johnson,Nikolaj Coster-Waldau,Taylor Kinney,Nicki Minaj, Deborah Twiss,Alyshia Ochse,Jennifer Glasgow,and David Thornton Directed By: Nick Cassavetes Review THE ODDEST FRIENDS ARE ABOUT TO GET EVEN You know with a title like this,and the situation that is presented in the film I thought their was going to chick after chick after chick,hence the title of the movie. The film is about what happens after discovering her boyfriend is married, Carly soon meets the wife he's been cheating on. And when yet another affair is discovered, all three women team up to plot mutual revenge on the three-timing SOB. The movie does achieve it's goal but not that much I mean it's not that funny. I only laughed like five times I believe during the movie. I rarely ever find that comedy film where I'm just laughing my butt off throughout the picture and I was expecting this to make laugh real hard a couple of times but it only did three out of five. The story is not that interesting though,if a male such as myself was about to watch this they would not be invested in the story,characters or situation presented here. The performances are very mediocre from the cast,Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann try to muster what they can but they just come off as not too good but not bad either. Kate Upton was pretty good though I mean she plays the dumb hot double d blonde and I honestly thought she pulled it off quite nicely. The direction is not that good,why in fact the director of this film is actually the director of one of my favorite romance movies of all time The Notebook and since this is his latest he's really hit the barrel of crap. The worst thing is that this movie talks about nothing,it's a chick flick and one of the most un-enjoyable ones I've ever seen. All of the elements of a good film are not present,it's really boring,not that funny and the acting is just so average that you just don't care. I'm giving this a two out of five.
This just wasn't good.
This film gets on your nerves very quickly. It's very dragged out.
as dull and lifeless as the taste of a sleeping pill. i can't go any further into the reasons why this is an absolute atrocity, because i failed to write them down. there's that many.
awful .. don't waist your time life is to short for such a crappy movie
The only the murdered here was Agatha Christie's Book. In fact Mr Branagh portrayal was truly awful along with the script and the CGI. Even the train model was wrong! Only 4 coaches? and super battery power  when the train derailed?Amazing!!! I think the biggest con of all was how Mr Branagh had duped his fellow actors into working on this terrible project. In fact if they had murdered him as a result then that would have been a film worth watching. 1 saving point was the magnificent moustache.
One Of The Worst Movies I've Ever Seen...!
I absolutely have no clue what this was all about. Please tell me this doesn't represent Chinese fantasy. Please.
The only magic trick here is to exploit a romance with a teenage pusher to peddle some violence, always the same. (Mauro Lanari)
the two leads aren't good actors at all. full of stupid dialogue. amateur hour. an overrated let down. 
this is not a movie. it can easily be mistaken for a student film. i could tell in the first two minutes. it could easily have been a 30 minute short film but they extended everything out to an hour and 20 so it could be feature length. long extended scenes of nothingness, and almost nothing happened the entire movie. and all of the anticipation led to a whimper of a climax (1 viewing)   SPOILERS   turns out these guys bet if a spider would bite and kill the girl. she survives. movie over. smh. and i don't even think they revealed what was in their locked purses
yikes. just... yikes.  the writing is awkward, nearly all of the acting is painful, the humor is repetitive and cringe-worthy and so many plot points made no sense or were just generic. the animated sequences are basically this movie's only redeeming quality. i really wanted to like this movie, but i just couldn't.
Just because they put Lee Van with a pretty boy doesn't mean it makes a good film, Lee was great with Clint in films but to me this was just to give him a payday with very poor acting.
The worst animated film I've ever seen.
A movie that believes it's smarter than it really is. They set out to provoke emotion and fail at every turn. Then, as if it wasn't bad enough, all the action was absolutely terrible.
This movie was like it's title Ghetto
The cover art that says demon house is more compelling and exciting than this entire film. The guy who narrates everything has no anything in his voice. I'd say it was meant to give an eerie tone, but it sounds like they hired the most boring sounding guy around... put him in a room and gave him a script they forgot to spell check and told him to read it with no context and recorded it.   The movie talks about how the house is possessed and the family went through so many things and then immediately cuts to Zak reading an article from the local paper that states that the grandmother of the family came forward and said none of it happened. Then it cuts back to Zak in the house saying "something definitely had to have happened."   Another example is when the narrator explains that in the weeks and months that followed everyone involved with this demonic house was affected  by this demon in some way. This guy slipped on the ice and fell and injured himself, this other person broke his hand when they hit a table, another person got 3rd degree motorcycle burns, a other guy was diagnosed with cancer and a tree almost landed on another person's car. Yep... demons. Of course let's not forget the 2 people who said it felt like something was strangling them while standing in a small cramped basement for 6 hours and then immediately saying that there is a serious black mold problem and the carbon monoxide is leaking from the broken exhaust vent on the furnace in the basement.  Spoiler alert--  This scary movie has a grand total of 4 jump scares. The last one... the big reveal after Zak seals himself in the house. About 4 seconds after Zak takes 2 attempts at turning the blur settings on his camera to 70% and then 99% a mysterious figure goes in front of the camera and then Zak freaks out a second too late and reacts by throwing his camera at the figure, which explains why there is no more footage from that camera during the film.  Also this movie is partially closed captioned. Roughly every third line of dialogue is written on the screen and they seem to change fonts halfway through the movie and then change back a minute later.   Overall it gets a half star out of 5 because it's nice to see you can indeed make a film on a $100 budget.
no characters,  flat plot,  crappy dialogue...  they may have  the 70s vibe  , but  that is  about the only thing they got right on this  film.
Watched it using boxxy software app. Disappointing very disappointing. To tell the truth I expected something much more complex, more interesting, more entertaining but in reality the film drags things a lot and the tremendous slowness that comes with its narrative affects the enjoyment because the story never immerses you.
Retarded piece of shit!!!
28/10/18 with Zhangs at OzAsia festival. If I knew the ending I would have walked out halfway through. I kept hoping there would be a great plot twist which would make the mind-numbing banality worth while. There wasn't. A classic movie that critics and pompous so called 'film buffs' like, whereas the the general public like, whereas the mainstream viewers think it's utter tripe. 
Watching a parody of Amy Winehouse burping on a caveman for what feels like an eternity makes me want to drown myself in a pool of Citizen Kane DVDs to erase this pile of stupid, brutally unfunny nonsense out of my memory.
worst of all movies.do not watch this movie
Boring, snooze fest of a movie that is basically a love letter to Bruce Springsteen. Utter garbage!
Absolutely boring... After 3/4 of the movie we finally get to the 'suspense' and at that point I am beyond checked out.   Seems like the directors love letter to herself... Poor camera and cinematography.   All in all I would not recommend this movie.
Can't get used to the cartoon-like characters.
Great concept terrible excuetion and one of the worst possible endings to have.
Probably the worst action thriller I ever watched. Dumb story, poorly executed with a few shooting scenes that won't rescue an otherwise piece of trash. Don't bother.
looks like another movie that makes it harder on the black man
this was stupid as hell that guy Nick Cannon suck so much ass in this they shouldn't have even paid his worthless ass
This has got to be one of the worst scary movies of all time. The acting is terrible, and it takes forever for the plot to take off.
After moderate success from Jim Carrey's The Mask in 1994, Master of Disguise seeks to abandon the oblivious alter ego and give the audience 100% goofy hero. They could not have done this in a more abysmally malpracticed manner. However, for those who thoroughly enjoy cinema's bottom of the bin, this offers mild enjoyment.
More humping than Heist.  I love Keanu, but this movie was truly awful and dull.  Got tired of the female lead's overacting really quickly.
11,- and 90 min. of my life I will never get back.
Awful beyond awful and a complete waste of time. Run don't walk from this piece of sod.
Stupid 300 parody! It's worse than Disaster Movie!
If i could give this a zero i would... this movie was horrible.  not only is it all done from POV and it's annoying.  but if you like completely open ended stories... this one is for you!
The worst movie since 1940. It's in line with an indie movie from Nigeria in the 40's. The plot is so full of holes it's actually a big A-Hole. Daniel the main actor's acting so bad, even in the first 5 minutes of his charming/evil-below-the-surface expression everyone knew how the story ends. The killer-is-not-dead-and-starts-attacking-again-scene near the end has been corny since 1955.
It's Not Dhaka. It's not Bangladesh. Information about Dhaka and Bangladesh is completely wrong. Very Poor Plot. Very wrong representing Bangladesh.
Death Note failed to capture many of the elements that made the original manga and anime material popular. Nat Wolff's Light Turner isn't the brilliant sociopath anti-hero you can root for, instead he's just an annoying high-schooler. Somehow LaKeith Stanfeild's L has all the answers, but we never see him figure anything out, he spends a majority of the movie sniveling when bad things happen, and he makes the smart choice to REMOVE HIS MASK TO KIRA rendering its use utterly pointless. Margaret Qualley's Mia is just some crazy girlfriend whose backstory isn't explained at all; does she even have a family or any motivations to kill? Many serious plot points are reduced to moments of bickering, like Mia trying to write Light's dad's name in the Death Note, or the final conversation in the ferris wheel. Little explanation is given for the appearance of an 8-foot demon, unless you're already familiar with the source material. The constant use of dutch angles made everything seem silly. The final nail in the coffin for this movie was the unnecessary robbery of roles for asian actors. There was really no reason L couldn't have been an asian character, he was literally speaking Japanese in part of the movie. This film is a shame.
As a huge follower of all the bands these actors are in, bvb in particular, i hated how it made them look, the acting was crap, it makes rock look exactly like the stereotype we all try to stop.
One of the worst movies I ever seen. The question is, Could anybody explain how a movie like this gets distribution ...???
This movie made me believe for a good while that God was dead.
I love Philip Kaufman's films, but wow, this film is such an atrocity.
Honestly this is my second time trying to sit through the whole movie and I just cannot it is so god damn boring
What did i just watch?!
I like Keanu but damn this movie awful. seemingly impossible to follow. repeated sex scenes and confusing plot. tons of subtitles. just terrible. 
Honestly one of the worst movies ever. If I could give 0 stars, I would. Not worth the watch, even if you want to laugh at how bad it is.
James Best at his best. His next role waqs Roscoe P. Coltrane in Dukes of Hazard and we all know what a failure THAT series was...not very popular at all.  Lots of screming, lots of confusing dialogue, lots of fun.
Even if this was my kind of comedy, I think I still would have hated it.
F*** this movie.  I hated this movie.  F*** this f***ing movie! Okay, now that that's out of my system, let's start at the beginning.  The film starts out promising.  It has a creepy tone, an interesting premise that has never really been explored before in horror, and the amateur actors are surprisingly good and their relationships feel completely natural.  As the film goes on though you start to realize it doesn't seem to know what it's doing.  It isn't until about 55 minutes in that anything actually interesting starts happening.  For a 95 minute movie, that's a major problem.  Before then we're just following these people going through various haunted house attractions around the country.  You ever watch haunted house walkthroughs on YouTube?  It's just 60 minutes of that.  Throughout those 60 minutes there were glimpses where I would see something happen and think to myself "okay, I think I see where they're going with this; that could be neat", but by the end of the film it becomes clear this wasn't the case.  That would be fine if the film was going in its own direction with something else interesting, but it ended without any answers.   When the plot twists I'm coming up with in my head are better than anything the movie is giving me, that's a problem.  I'm not saying I need things spoon-fed to me, but when I can find 20 different crater-sized plot holes in the ambiguous story I'm given, you gotta' give me something.  As it stands, it seems like they had no idea what they were doing and just went with a f***ed up ending for the sake of a f****ed up ending.  No rhyme or reason, no point, nothing to say, and wildly unearned.  The final shot of this movie is so mean, hopeless, and entirely illogical, it just made me want to scream at the TV. In some ways I feel bad about picking on this movie, it's clearly got good ideas and everyone involved seems to be trying.  But good ideas only get you so far, you have to some place to go with them.  And this movie had nowhere to go with them.  Maybe someone could remake this and do it right, because there's good ideas here.  I like the idea of exploring haunted house culture, I like the idea of showing places that take things too far, but this film doesn't want to do anything with those ideas.  It teases you with them but then eventually falls on to boring horror tropes and outright human cruelty.  This is the worst movie I've seen in years.  It's a horror movie with no scares and nothing interesting to say.  At its best, it's boring.  At its worst, it's mean-spirited and needlessly uncomfortable.
another invisible man in the sky story. How about just being human 
Big cast, scenic views but boring movie.  Watch it in fast forward mode then it will be better.
Fell asleep and couldn't care less.
Avoid this movie at all costs. Any film that has a repeatitive soundtrack featuring gross Miley Cyrus in her skank phase, plus the overall tone of the film trying to be FEMINIST when only one single character displays any sort of Feminism is a transvestite/pre-op...is disgusting. Stop Hollywood from spreading false information - feminism is about equal rights. Not genitalia in your face, branding men as psychos if they do not go down and definitely not revenge porn committed with assault rifles.
Just aweful. This kind of "comedy" is just the worst. All it is, is pop culture references and toilet humor that is out of date upon relese.
I heard it was bad so I'm going to rate it half
I laughed throughout this movie. Donald Glover and Evan Peters are hot though... How's Hollywood gonna do them like that??? Lol
Susan Ward plays a "hawt" girl who stalks around in an evening dress, trying to slash those who get in her way.  Rather boring, this is recommended for fans of vapid characters trying to drag along an unmoving story.
Have 100+ million budget and still make a dumb movie... That is something. Best thing about power rangers for me is a suit, in this dumb movie u will se full suit with face mask for 5 minutes. 
Total heresy. This movie is un opinionated and does give all the facts or tell the truth of the pain and disappointment many have felt.
Adam is the story of a cis man with a lesbian fetish not understanding that trans men are, you know, men, and uses being mistaken for a transman to somehow try to convince a lesbian to have sex with him, because apparently no one involved -- starting with the writer of the piece of crap novel it was based on to the person who got stuck with the chore of adapting that drivel to the screen, to the director, to the actors saying the words -- seems to know what lesbians are.
Agonizing to watch. Bored to tears.
Dont be fooled by the tomato meter.. this movie was awful
0 Stars (won't allow me to leave 0) Great, killing children because of pseudoscientific, fraudulent nonsense. Nicely done 'Merca!
esperaba mucho más, muy decepcionante.
the garden gave me birdbox vibes bushes moved too much like they were trying to tell us it was a bad movie or sumthing idk og was better
This movie was a constant piss off. Why was  this movie in my house.
Pointless!, is the only word that comes to mind after viewing this TERRIBLE film. Total waste of my hard earned money.
I wish I could extract this movie from my memory. Awful.
Should have been called "The Other Women".
Stereotyped flat characters and a predictable weak plot.
anecdotes are the same as scientific evidence, and that personal observation ("I've seen it with my own eyes!") should be compelling enough reason to believe in the public health nightmare that is the anti-vaxx movement.
very bbbbbaaaaaad and cheesy
Dumb boring forgettable mishmash garbage
looks like another movie that makes it harder on the black man
Keanu Reeves, getting shot In the back was too good for you... you should have had your eyelids removed and forced to watch this damn movie - on a loop! #worstmovieever Now how do you expect me to take John Wick 3 seriously???
I’ve had cancer less painful than this film. 
One of the worst films ever made.
Self involved and uninteresting.
Not even Christina Ricci's acting or my love for John  Cusack can save this movie! Did the director just cast his friends for  the rest of the parts? No one else is even watchable
incredibly horrible story but the movie production somehow turns a very offensive movie into one thats hard to watch because of the awkwardness of the acting and the stunted and uncomfortable dialogue
I don’t know why I keep getting interested in M Night Shyamalans movies. They’re all terrible. And laughable at best. 
Truly a horrid waste of time.
I tried to give it a NEGATIVE 5 stars.  It was horrendous!
Can't i give it less than half a star?
Will Ferrell is funnier as a guest on a talk show on any given day than in the entire movie here. What a fucking disgrace.
Horrible. Bad acting, they are not able to follow the damn fucking lore and a pica constantly making sex jokes, really?!? Not just bullshit it is an insult to everybody who likes Pokémon in general...
An underdeveloped story that ultimately fell flat and jumped off the rails midway. The film's characters continued to pretend they were mislead yet the goal of the project was always plainly stated. Although the story obviously had to take some scientific leaps, a man turning into a lizard virtually overnight was absurd. 
who thought this idea was okay? do i need to warn anyone that i'm going to spoil the ending...b/c i'm going to...  how does being partially living tissue equal supernatural abilities? i know, i know, it's just a movie...but what in the holy hell was going on during the writing of this script?!  that being said...please watch this...it's so very very very bad.
trash the new rodrick looks like an alien
Fiction portraying itself as a truthful documentary. What's the point?
Insulting to the original series.
Bad movie! Walk out of the theatre disappointed
When I heard the commercial for “Collateral Beauty” on the radio, I thought it sounded pretentious. After I watched the movie, I was not disappointed. Within the first quarter of the film, the plot was easily detected. Not since “I see dead people” has a plot been so clear. Though some key plot points are presented in a cleaver way, other aspects don’t make sense. If Time, Love, and Death were real, why did they need to remove them digitally from the video. Wouldn’t a better plot point be for the reveal that the video didn’t need to be altered? That he was talking to himself? But that would be for Edward, Michael, and Kate’s character’s benefit and not Smith’s character’s. I guess it was all about Will Smith’s character and not about “the rest”, even though they have just as much screen time and more character investment in the story. The movie rides on its pretentiousness and cast. Unfortunately plot holes and terribly transparent cut away shots pull you out of the movie. 
a great story with as much flavor as a glass of flat water.
This movie could have been better
Gave up after 15 excruciating minutes. How can people make such rubbish.
This is the most ignorant piece trash I have ever seen. I gave it 1/2 a star because Kieth David is sexy and the vote don't count if you don't vote.  The  first Tales from the Hood was creepy, intelligent,  and very insightful. Tales from the Hood brought issue that plagued the black community but no one talked about. The first movie handed blacks a notable platform. Tale from the Hood was pure gold. Tale from the Hood 2 is pure crap. I couldn't make it though the last hour, so I don't know or care what happen in the last hour.  This movie tried too hard to be humorous. It had no point. The acting was horrible (aside from Keith David).  There was no scary scene or bone chilling twist. The stories, that I saw, lacked any suspense, horror, character, depth, and presentation. I believe that this was just a check for everybody, when it could have been ground breaking or a least enjoyable. At the very least, Keith David skill could have been you utilized so much better.
terrible bad unoriginal predictable.
This movie sucks. One of the worst movies ever made
A real piece of shit
Very bad -- a cheaply told tale of adolescent irresponsibility.  This is a religious movie and has nothing to do with rock and roll.
It's 2020 and I just watched this movie. Naomi Watts can really cuss but then again this is a new York based movie so I guess everybody better know how to cuss.. it was a fun movie.
Very entertaining and fun. interesting religious background
Wife and I loved it! Surprised it got such terrible ratings.  Even if it was predictable, it was still great.
I was exited when my favorite tv show got a movie! but it isn't similar enough to the show and not canon, but it is still a good movie! 8/10 awesome!
The characters are great, the film is shot as if you are there with the characters, & the action is stellar when it happens. While being a Power Rangers movie it is also a movie about people, & that is where it truly shines. Now I want some Krispy Kreme for some reason.
Much to enjoy, even as much could have been better: Michael Sheen's robo-bartender. Impressive set designs, a slick shopping mall of a ship, Heathrow international terminal meets futuristic Princess Cruiseship.  Interesting premise deserving of more compelling execution.
Probably the most faithful Philip K Dick adaptation so far. The decision to go as animation serves its purpose to portray a world which lines between reality, hallucinations and identity are blurred. Keanu Reeves fits the profile right and some great work from Robert Downey Jr and Woody Harrelson.
Powerful and heartfelt movie about a young boy finding his way home on the streets of India. It also gives us a glimpse of of so many children affected by poverty
I have no idea why this film only has 14% on rotten tomatoes. I liked it.
dark and slow, yet totally captivating. loved benny's numbness throughout. pretty brutal, but tastefully done. not as weird/experimental as some of his other films, and i'm cool with that. overall a super cool story.
When is a black-and-white silent comedy neither black-and-white nor silent?  Actor/director Jacques Tati's ultimate statement was "Play Time," an extravagantly staged satire that has gained acclaim with passing years. It's easy to see why this droll look at metropolitan life was a box-office disappointment -- it has almost no plot or dialogue of consequence, and its meticulous jokes are dry, abstract sight gags. The intentionally sterile color scheme is all pale blues, whites and grays, and the film's use of language is uniquely strange -- lines appear in both English and French, but they function as background chatter so trivial that no one even bothered to add subtitles. Discernible lines usually sound like post-production looping, and there are so few close-ups that matching words with mouths is barely an issue. The effect is like watching reels from a company security camera.  Only a few characters stand out as recurring presences. Of course, the most important is Tati's raincoated alter-ego Mr. Hulot. But Tati is more interesting as a filmmaker than an actor -- Hulot's rather limited repertoire depends on lumbering around with an awkward, theatrical gait that soon grows tiresome (imagine a hesitant combination of stretching to see over a high fence and checking for squeaky floorboards). Other repeat faces include a visiting woman who ends up playing piano in a chaotic restaurant, a busy little man trying to keep a meeting with Hulot and an endearing doorman who's forced to perform his duties in useless pantomime after a glass door is shattered.  "Play Time"'s influence on both Benny Hill and Roy Andersson is unmistakeable.  I'm rounding up my rating as an act of faith, because I can't think of another movie I've seen that was so grossly damaged by a small-screen viewing. Given a film that's almost entirely composed of wide shots, the steady parade of subtle visual jokes demands intense attention on mere inches of the TV image. Hopeless. I felt as if 75% of the humor eluded me.
First Hit:  A very thoughtful film that deepens and, at times, darkens with feelings just as the Montana winter closes in.  This film is, in essence, three separate yet interrelated stories of three women and their relationship with their inner self, work and the world about them. The film opens with Laura Wells (Laura Dern), as an attorney, having an affair with Ryan (James Le Gros) who happens to be Gina Lewis's (Michelle Williams), husband. The strength and intelligence of this film is displayed in this opening scene. Long camera shots letting scenes play themselves out with words being a secondary communication device. The camera focuses on the faces letting the audience peer within the character. Of particular beauty was the stark motel room, only seeing Ryan, through the oval wall mirror, while Laura laid on the bed, contemplating the events, her life and her feelings about it.  Laura finds herself enabling a client named Fuller (Jared Harris) who is lost after a work event that left him disabled and unable to continue working. He's confused and refuses to believe that he gave away his rights for a tort suit against his former employer as explained by Laura. These scenes of enabling build up to where she finally changes the situation.  Gina is introduced to the audience as she is warming down from a run, smoking a cigarette, and walking through a forested path. She's serious and thoughtful in her look as she enters a campground. We soon learn she's the powerful one in her family consisting of her husband Ryan and daughter Guthrie (Sara Roder). There is a moment when Gina indicates she dislikes being made the villain in the family. She feels undermined by Ryan which shows up as they discuss obtaining sandstone for the home they are building from Albert's (Rene Auberjonois) yard. The long shots on her face left me feeling haunted by the weight she is bearing.  We meet Jamie (Lily Gladstone) working on a horse ranch. She leads a quiet life tending horses, watching TV, and eating. The scenes of her existence were made more lively, and funny to the audience, by the Corgi that always chases her as she puts hay into the corrals for the horses. The darkness of where she lives and the barn mirrors the loneliness of her life. One evening she gets into her truck and ventures to a school where she quietly takes root in the back row of a class with four other adults. The others in the class know each other, she's an outsider. Into the classroom walks a young lawyer named Beth (Kristen Stewart) and we learn she's a newly minted lawyer and has driven 4 hours to teach a class on Student / Educational Law. She acknowledges she knows little about this but has been studying. All the students, except Jamie, ask questions that directly affect themselves and try Beth's patience. By going to a diner after class Jamie and Beth learn more about each other. Again, the long camera shots on their faces was extraordinary in giving the audience a glimpse of what is going on within them. What is going on with Jamie is that she is falling in love with Beth.  This is what made this film strong. In male oriented films there are quicker camera movements and more cuts. There is more of an overt purpose in directing the story in a particular direction, here the audience finds their way into the story by studying these women through their faces and movements.  Dern was amazing as someone who is alone, competent, caring and struggling to not be an enabler. Williams was sublime as a beautifully powerful strong woman that is finding her way through family life and what it is she wants her home to be. Harris is interesting as the man who is confused and dismayed at his current predicament. His reliance on Laura is interestingly dependent. Le Gros is good as the detached husband who is dependent on his strong wife. Gladstone was amazing. I loved her quiet depth, her aching heart, and pragmatic persistence. She was so powerful in this film by saying so very little. Stewart was wonderful as the object of Jamie's affection. One of my favorite exchanges was when Beth said that in her family, the highest job they could attain was being a shoe salesperson. That she became a lawyer was something she held on to with tenuous hope and the audience feels this. Auberjonois was exceptionally sweet as a man slowly losing his memory. Kelly Reichardt wrote and directed this with an eye for letting the characters show what is going on with themselves by letting the camera see them. A job well done.  Overall:  This film is not for everyone, but if you want to gaze into the depth of certain women, see "Certain Women".
Pretty cool for a 70's movie. I can't remember if I've seen this before, I remember my friend kept talking about it when I was a kid. Anyways, it was pretty enjoyable the didn't do to bad on the giant animals for considering when it was made. I think the insects were the only things that I had the biggest issue with, but they only had a short part in the movie.
I think they did a good job with this movie. The characters were ones you could connect to, and everyone in the cast did a great job. But all that krispy kreme tho
A above averge spaggettie western with a good twist ending. Lee Van Cleff is good and strong. Probly not for people who do not like the genre.
Strength is the key play in this latest sports drama that holds a story that may not show a majority of inspirations, but instead retell the story of an amazing streak went down after a loss and soon the team somehow lost their mojos and needed to learn how to get back on their feet, hence the title. It's all about a high school football team respecting their brotherhood and coach while regaining their strength with a philosophical meaning they'll soon learn of the true meaning of strength. The retelling of this story was well done. (B+)  (Full review coming soon)
I've seen this movie before, and I don't know why I haven't reviewed it until now.  There is a lot of humor that kind of goes under the radar if you're not paying attention.  I think that casting is perfect for this movie, and everything works well.
not fantastic, but still good
Although it has a few slow moments—scenes that kind of drag on—I really enjoyed this movie.  Took this Gen-X'er on a trip back in time.  Very heartwarming story about the balance of  finding oneself and staying true to our roots.  Highly recommend.
I saw death rising from the earth, from the ground itself, in one blue field, in stubbled color
Jude Law is pretty incredible in what I'd describe as an odd but entertaining dark comedy.
Fast, thrilling, and enjoyable, American Satan creates an accurate feeling of the rock and roll world while dipping its toes into a deeper theme with religion and music.
Spectacular story. Acting was good but not great. Also some unnecessary parts.
Funny, violent, witty, gritty and Jude Law at his best, what's not to like?
A faithful and colorful adaptation of the classic with probably the most brilliant ensemble cast ever assembled in recent decades. Looking forward to Branagh's sequel !
I liked this film, it was silly and pretty hilarious. I don't see how people dislike this film, it's not the worst film I've seen but it's quite enjoyable!
I thought Jude Law was amazing in the film This is the part e has been waiting for to show his chops off. It was surreal, Law was over the top in a monumental way, but it all fit. It kept me watching. I was impressed by the freshness of some of the scenes, especially the car crash. Film can go anywhere it does not have to be exact and "real" in this film the fantasy like scene worked. I thought the was intelligent, quick and fit with the tone. Overall, it was enjoyable. So many times I am disappointed and I keep waiting for the the film to get better, it usually doesn't this one delivered.
Very moving film . passion ++ heartbreak ++. humanity 100%
A quick very entertaining movie. It really puts you in your seat and gets your heart going a bit. Definitely worth a watch 
A light-hearted romp with some great moments, like when Sandra Bullock explains why she loves her boots.
In my opinion, This movie will become film art. It will be timeless. I do think it moved very slow. However, It is beautifully done. The movie does feel like 1970's. I think it hits the mark. It keeps you guessing about what happened to this couple.  To me, their voyeurism tells a story of what they might have been like and they are trying to get back to that place.  If anyone has watched a french film from the 70's its perfect what kept me watching was trying to figure out what it was that was between them. Overall, I thought it was a beautiful movie. 
I really liked this movie. I like chris pratt's arc but really like Jennifer Lawrence arc. She forgives him for a selfish act
A lolita, a French Arab and confused feelings of love masked under an erotic guise. A story about monogamous relationships versus perversion. Chimo's writing is moving, but what is more moving are the events that transpire towards the end of the story
powerful good drama gr8 cast
It's not a movie I'd watch twice, but I had a lot of fun with this.
This film is my childhood. Maybe it's the nostalgia talking, but this is a genuinely well-rounded comedy. It's funny, and it has some likable characters with their own story arcs, especially Dexter. Throughout the film, Dexter learns how to be responsible, nice, and NOT manipulative.
I think I saw this a few years back and it's that good type of bad. Probably one of the best sci-fi big animal movies of the 1970s.
(5.0 out of 6) When we see getting in and out is easy when others don't see it coming. When we see what gets us out are bigger things to focus on that we need to be part of in with those we owe. When others don't see what else we get in behind their back we do them in another way. When what others don't see what we get in is only our choice to make. When what others wish to get out they turn those in, when being in this type of business others don't want to be in trouble. When what we get in we can't get out,  when it's the law. When others try to get us out, they see to we we get less. When what others get themselves into they can't get out when it's disloyalty to only see out another way death. When in this parts what others try to prevent getting in, we get it out another way when we get it in the street another way.   When what is not getting those out we get out the word and warning when some parts are our own to control when we oversee what gets in and out of our parts without the law knowing. When only a country let's the goods in to there parts when they have a purpose & business for coming out to such places. When others have seen action going in and coming out of other dangerous places we know what such parts are like to know what which side to be in and out. When what parts keep a look out for us we see what lines we don't cross. When what we get out we can't let others in when we can't see to fail to not let anyone stand in our way. When what we let in are those who are in such businesses to know we can mix business with pleasure.   When we know what are products do to bring those in when it turns those in to entertainment and much more pleasurable. When what brings those in to such places, bring others out inro our place when they think they run such parts. When what others turn such parts in we need to get out or buy out when there is enough money to go around to  serve the peace. When what we need to get others in, when mixing business & pleasure we know others would buy in more and more when such places attracts those in from every parts. When what others don't buy in they only want to get out. When others want to get out, we see they get in with the law when we are not the only ones who are corrupt in doing business. When what we see by our side we do those in, when bribes gets us in deeper with those whom need to protect us in their parts. When what others send out the message to stay out we send the message we are here to stay in business by pushing out those who threaten us.   When what shame others bring in, we punish when some places are to keep such acts out. When what others are in for is love. When we see what got us in other places we see another way out to get into other places when we become a spokesperson for good. When what others are in we make others see to get out when what we now represent we can't associate with those in bad ways. When what we can't seem to get in their head when they see us in every men we leave out. when what others believe in we can't break. When such things we are in, can also bring in alot of people those who are just entering in the country. When news of those in higher places entering we see we can't touch when those put us out of business. When what others have been in they only wish other places they wish to be in is better then the hell we been through. When what we can't get out from we stay in, when we come in from below where you least expect us to be in and take those out, when there is no other way out for those when everyone is all in.  When we see getting out is easier when there is nobody else in but ourselves. When what others are in and can't get out, they lash out at us when we got those in such dirty businesses. When we see that even being free we are still not out when such places we are in is a reminder of what we left behind. When what we lost is just a reminder of what we get into that we are never out when also many have lost and we are in it till the end.
Very interesting, intelligent, heart-felt, well-written, thoughtful, well-paced, and holding drama.
Lion may be a predictable film but it’s a very heartwarming film and very well-made. Performances all around are top-notch. Cinematography is wonderful and the movie is very moving as well especially towards the end. Lion may not be a perfect film but it’s definitely one film that shouldn’t be missed.
I can't believe I've postponed watching it for so long. It is now my favorite non-Leone spaghetti western. It might not be on par with Leone's best of the best, but it's certainly on the same level of A Fistful of Dollars. Might even be a little better, actually. Such a great flick!
Thought-provoking, as all of Nolan's movies. However, some parts of the movies were slow, and the conclusion wasn't that satisfying, but ultimately, the movie entertained.
Enjoyed the movie immensely. Well acted and well written. The story and subplots were interesting and flowed smoothly. Don't understand the poor reviews.
Great movie with a lot of twists. Great acting by Christina Ricci
Funny and creative. Ending was a bit too tidy.
Great movie. The kids in this movie are talented! Crazy story!
Great flick. Denzel  disappears beneath  ticks and mannerism as he channels the quirky Roman J. Israel, Esq. One of Denzel's best performances. A must see for any fans of Mr. Washington and his acting prowess.
*Spoiler-Warning*  Tone-Deaf is a funny, intelligent slasher movie, about generational divides and dysfunctional families.  Amanda Crew plays an unemployed, chronically-depressed twenty-something, renting a vacation home from a mentally unstable widower played by Robert Patrick. Crew's character feels lost and confused, while Patrick's feels deranged and perpetually angry at the modern world. Both performers expertly capture the tensions and anxieties of millennials and baby boomers in a way that is both tragic and funny. Yes, the characters are basically borderline stereotypes of these age groups, but they're well-written, three-dimensional versions of those stereotypes, each with their own struggles and desires.  The film was a lot gorier than I thought it'd be. I don't want to go into details, but let's just say that it earns it R-rating, even ignoring the language and dark subject matter. Though I wouldn't say it's as gory as some of the classic slasher films from the 1980s.  The thing I liked most about this movie was how it handled its weightier themes. It deals with some very heavy topics such as depression, suicide, relationships, mental health, and family. But instead of plunging into somber melancholy or hollow despair, the film opts for more creative, at times bizarre methods to explore its themes.  SPOILER STARTS HERE!!!  To use an example from the film; one of the major sub-plots is the main character's trauma over the suicide death of her father when she was a kid. In one scene toward the middle of the film, the main character gets high on LSD, and encounters a vision of her deceased father. The conversation that follows is funny, sad, and slightly off-putting, in a way that feels natural to the subject matter, without cheapening it.   SPOILER ENDS HERE!!!  It's this willingness to be both poignant and weird at the same time that makes the film stand out. Its not afraid to switch between being sad and funny. Yes, it sometimes feels a little cheesy, and maybe a little tonally-inconsistent, but so what? There was once a time when horror movies were allowed to be a little weird and wacky, without having to sacrifice meaningful drama. They weren't ashamed of their pulp-sensibilities mixing with real-world issues.   Not every horror movie needs to be Hereditary, nor should they.
A gripping story by Daniel Z. Berk.  If you are interested in understanding the complexity of the Middle East or you want to end the scourage of terrorism, you should consider seeing this movie.
Cute and dysfunctional.
Awesomely bad b-movie with laughable effects and even worse acting. I'm not sure if they actually killed rats making this movie, but it kind of looks like it, so be warned.
American sniper does a good job telling the story of Chris Kyle. The performances are excellent and Bradley Cooper really delivers. The cinematography and dialogue are all top-notch. The movie is a little predictable and for the most part just shows you different parts of Kyle's life. Some pacing in a few areas is a bit off. Overall it's well worth watching though I wouldn't say it's one of the best films of the year.
I'm not sure why all the negative reviews. The soundtrack was good and the story was enjoyable. A fun movie when we really need one. Jake and Travis need a sequel.
A really good movie. Lee Van Cleef was awesome in it
Ejecta is an ambitious and imperfect movie, but I don't think it comes close to being as crummy as some reviewers found it. I can see how it would have a hard time finding its audience - imagine if Samuel Beckett, in need of ping pong money maybe, had banged out a script for Roger Corman. A lot of the writing is excellent, and Julian Richings and Lisa Houle are wonderful actors. This is a good movie to watch if you prefer seeing somebody fail at being brilliant rather than succeed at being conventional. Plus, it has a truly scary monster - and I don't mean the alien.
This had a lot of heart. I now look back on Sesame Street with greater fondness.
So scary I almost feel bad for liking it
its a grand movie very funni!!!!!
great movie,need more fathers to do this
I almost didn't watch this movie because it was rated only 3.6/5 on Amazon Prime.  But I started watching it while having dinner and then, I didn't stop after I was done eating even though I had things to do.  I was captivated and pretty freaked out.  After the movie was done, I was wondering how it was rated on Rotten Tomatoes, so I came here.  What I found was of course that the ratings are absolutely lousy and so, I decided that I really wanted to speak out.  This is actually my very first Rotten Tomatoes review.  My advice is:  Don't listen to the naysayers and give this movie a chance; it's a good horror film.
A more mature type of movies but I found it rather interesting.
If one can get past the initial incredibly depressing 45 minutes, one is in for a truly satisfying tale of family values, right vs. wrong, and nationalistic symbolism. Nargis is a powerhouse in 'Mother India,' and catapults it into the upper levels of Bollywood fame.  This is one of the better paced Hindi films I've seen --- I actually wish the last half hour of the film could have been extended and thought it felt a bit rushed. One really feels the raw emotion coming from characters and the script while managing to forgo the melodrama that carries (or plagues, depending on who you ask) most Bollywood epics. And the climax? 'Mother India's ending simply has to be seen to be believed.
WOW! Talk about when animals attack! I've heard about this movie ever since it came out in 1976 and I'm sure it double featured at the drive-in but I just never got to see it - I've waited a long time and feel I missed having a classic in my movie bank - A classic? Absolutely! When you watch ...this type of movie...Sci-Fi / Horror...they tend to go on the cheap and it feels like they were just throwing it together but not this one - I felt they were trying very hard to make this the most believable they could - Did they succeed? In a sense they did because you didn't really laugh at what was presented - OK...fighting off the giant rooster was close - Regardless...I liked what I saw and again felt they were doing their best to keep it as real as they could so for that they get high marks
fast paced, but I love Robert Duran's story so good stuff.
I think it could have been done better... Buuut it still made me cry so there's that... 
Just about the time I thought it was getting slow, there was a montage!  Perfect!
insightful look at conflict's between faith and adversity. a study of how families are also impacted by wars and separation.
Very nice portrayal of the true story of a lost Indian boy, adopted by an Aussie couple and returning to India 25 years later to find his birth family.
This is how rom-coms should be made (although it does tailor quite heavily to the male market, hehe). Hilarious and crude. Doesn't pretend to be deep and majorly philisophical, but still got me thinking. Good stuff.
There goes the bride. How do you know you've chosen the one when life is so full of possibilities? Released on January 27, 2006, Imagine Me & You was produced under the title Click while being the first directorial credit for screenwriter Ol Parker. I thought it was really amusing to have an opening lyric from a hit song by The Turtles and use it as a movie title. And the first time I found this on a recent TV broadcast I was surprised to be watching a lesbian romantic comedy...from Britain! Piper Perabo and Lena Headey were amazing and looked cute together onscreen while performing well in their acting performances. The storyline becomes a complicated love triangle when husband Heck realizes something has gone wrong in their marriage once Rachel fell for Luce. Though dramatic, it was funny in some ways. Watch this overall great romance title if you're looking something different from your usual (and I mean heterosexual) love story.  "You're a wanker Number Nine!"
i'm a sucker for australian films...
Loved, loved, loved it!!! This movie was amazing. Heard and Costner were amazing!
The last line in this movie pretty much sums it all up. What the f***?
Among the feel goodiest of feel-good movies
I'm not a big fan of boxing movies or boxers but I love movies about the past and how I remember it and the rags to riches to spoiled rich dough bag and there fall or redemption
I loved this movie. Brash, foul mouthed, and violently entertaining. A fantastic ride.
Decent slasher! Moments of good tension come occasionally.
The busload-full of skilled actors Canet has brought with him damn-near ensures a compelling sit, even if the film's ponderous pacing and resulting length do detract somewhat from its finer qualities.
Love this movie, a lot.
A fantastic retrospective of a lesser known fixture of the Henson Muppet family, the Caroll Spinney story is not one I've properly heard and it's a beautiful one. A wonderful look back at the man behind Big Bird, that was only let down by the fact that he has led a rather regular life. Instead this felt like it might have been a more comfortable film if it had simply been a retrospective of the brilliance of Sesame Street. Strangely emotional and occasionally sad, but ultimately uplifting.
Dark, gritty and realistic-feeling, this cleverly-filmed (the camera, as the audience's window into the events, hardly ever leaves the vehicle) neo-noir thriller is one helluva ride. Frank Grillo gives a great performance in a role that fits him to a T, which is good considering the majority of the film is focused on him, specifically his face. From a story perspective it's simple, but is executed in a way that maximises on what it has to work with, creating a ridiculously tense atmosphere that is, somehow, sustained throughout the entire running time and has you on the edge of your seat. It's basically 'Locke' on speed.  By the way, I don't know what part of Boston Wheelman lives in where there's only one bar and one bank open past 8 pm, but at least you know where every one of those 5 people on the roads is going.
Many self-satisfied critics missed the boat on this one, Big Kill.  Probably still fawning over black panther, writing up comparisons to citizen kane.    The many quiet dialogue scenes versus big action in Big Kill, are to establish character and affinity for these classic western types.  That is, before they all shoot each other up in the street.    The film is intentionally over-stylized in showing western tropes, both in character and in plot.  This, the critics have pounced upon, as if the film were not self aware.  I mean the set is smaller than a high school campus.  When the bad guys and good guys go to their respective corners, you'd assume they could hear each other plotting from a few hundred feet away.  This adds to the stage-like and stylized atmosphere, but no so much to break the illusion of nor ridicule the source material.  After all, this not so much a depiction of the old west, but the old western movie.    It is refreshing to see a film where characters, even though each represents a classic western type versus any unique persona, talk to each other and show sincere emotion.    Hard to see the film finding an audience with comic books passing for literature these days, and cgi passing for high art.
I absolutely loved the mood and setup of this film. Well-acted, with such a rich diverse set of characters that all represent tropes from various film genres. However, with an excess of flashback jumping, and a resulting too-long runtime, El Royale is not a perfect mystery thriller.
RT drops the ball again. This is actually a well done movie. Yes, Chan does what Chan does but it's Pierce Brosnan that steals the show. He's become very good at playing attractive but ambiguous characters of slippery moral virtue (think The Matador.) His role in this is along those lines. Though not a revenge flick of John Wick or Payback quality, this still delivers a satisfying feeling of justice (partially) served. I especially liked the backdrop of Irish terrorism, a subject that's taken a backseat to so called "Islamic terror" these days.
Romantic, touching, family & love...that's what I can say about this movie!
Thought the movie was very interesting. Good story .
The depiction of poverty seems to be almost realistic but teaches how one family man encourages his family to be optimistic by being resilient even though it doesn't help which the mentality of his belief is reflected and expressed through film. While the fact-based story has a sense of sympathetic desperation, it has progressively built strength and relied on the excellent cast to function the heart which they did successfully, especially Larson examining distanced dysfunction and Harrelson putting in duplicated emotions behind meaningful life lessons. (B+)  (Full review TBD)
Though the film did not end up being quite what I expected, Washington's superb performance does more than enough to carry the picture.
An impressive film about someone being stalked which illustrates just how vulnerable we are. The 1st person camera view, although over done as a category was well thought and placed. There were tense moments and some "Oh Shhhhttt" moments. Clever use of camera angles to portray cell phone camera and laptop camera. I recommend it.
Good story well told, all the more affecting because its true.
Ah, never underestimate the quiet ones. :)
Carol Spinney was the man behind Sesame Street's Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch and when the movie focuses on him it's wonderful.  The documentarians try to also summarize a lot of broader muppet topics.  If you're into this kind of thing, you'll like it!  Final Score: 8/10
Despite it's flaws, it's a solid action/adventure. What it lacks in character development and dynamism it makes up for in sheer brutality and well-realized craftsmanship. Also, the focus on the more troubling aspects of Maori culture is a refreshing look at pre-Colonial NZ, not to mention the authenticity of the film helps bring the story to life. Thankfully, the film is also entirely in Te Reo Maori.  Toa Fraser might be a Kiwi director to look out for. Hopefully he can keep it up!
Great movie. Excellent story line and emotional attachment to the movie.
This is good.. really good.
I enjoyed this movie a lot.....changing plot, action, kept you interested
How come these numbers in the rating ?
Charming move to see at home on a quiet Thanksgiving evening.
I thought this film was brilliant! It is completely absurd, which is what makes it so funny. Since Schwartzenegger doesn't appear until near the end of the film, it's assumed that he is probably Gunther. Once he does show up, he becomes the centerpiece. The end is practically Gunther being a caricature of Schwarzenegger. Gunther returns to his home country of Austria. This movie has many laugh out loud moments but it also has even more under the radar funny cracks and quips. A very underrated movie.
It's hard for people to imagine that confederate soldiers were humans with complex loyalties and motivations.  And, God forbid, that many white people fought for a cause to which they didn't subscribe...yet still fought, for their fellow soldiers and their families and a host of other reasons.  Life is messy.  This film is complimentary, not anathema, to the realities of the Civil War.
Wow... Christopher and Brooke are soooo beautiful in this film. It's kind of a timeless romance. It's not amazing by any stretch but very beautiful, and lovely to see Christopher's young tanned body naked. Yum.
I still have no idea what this movie is supposed to be about besides trying to combine Weekend at Bernie's and Castaway and adding a ridiculous amount of fart jokes. The only logical conclusion is that the team of writers were both stoned.
It's clear Serkis learned a thing or two after working as a second unit director on The Hobbit because his directorial debut is absolutely splendid. Breathe is a brilliant fact-based drama telling an extraordinary story in the best way it can. Although it feels plodding at times, the film greatly benefits from the powerful performances of Foy and Garfield. I certainly look forward to Andy Serkis' next project which I hope will include some action.
Not bad. Entertaining enough to be worth watching. A bit rough around the edges.
This is a classic style science fiction horror film with Bishop himself Lance Henriksen in a key role and the movie is executed extremely well. The prosthetic work is the best I've seen in years, the sets feel real, music, sound and physical effects are all pulled off beautifully. The only few places that this movie falls short are a few of the actors come off a bit stiff, the lighting sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, some of the prosthetic doesn't look perfect at certain angles but where I think this movie loses the most is actually the quality that its filmed at. Now with everything being in HD and high quality you can see every single flaw this movie has where you wouldn't notice the same flaws if you were watching say Aliens. Despite the problems this movie knows exactly the audience that its trying to reach and it does, it does with flying colors. For a cheesy sci fi horror flick coming out in 2015 this movie does exactly what it promises, nothing more nothing less.
How does Mark Wahlberg get off of a airplane and then drive himself back home on a motorcycle? He didn't have a ride home, hence the whole purpose of Will Ferrell coming to pick him up at the freaking !airport.
Knowing that this is one of Michelle Obama's favorite films of last year and that she held a private screening for this very small, independent film at the White House last year because she believed it had a very important message will most likely keep many from seeing this movie ... and that is a shame.  It will be ignored, belittled and scoffed at just like Mister & Pete in this film -- two young boys who must fend for themselves one summer in the projects of NYC as their unmotivated, tragic and horrible parental figures are arrested for dealing drugs and sent away to rehab facilities while the kids are long-forgotten by both them and the authorities.  Jennifer Hudson (Dreamgirls) co-stars as the miserable mother of Mister (Skylan Brooks) who finds himself responsible for the younger neighbor Pete (Ethan Dizon) when Pete's drug-dealing/prostitute mother also finds herself in trouble.  Jordan Sparks (Sparkle) and Anthony Mackie (The Hurt Locker) co-star.  The film is very low budget and not one that churns out plenty of fell-good moments; but it tries to shine a light on a topic some of us just don't want to talk about or acknowledge ... you know, because it actually goes away when we remain quiet.  The movie is about a sad situation; but more sad is that so many of us decide to do nothing about it.
Predictable. Too predictable at the least
It may not be a great thriller, but it is entertaining, it is true that the script has holes and it seems that an dude with Asperger has written it because the way to tell us that the characters are going to make love is too direct and these scenes being a Quick valve to advance the story (Thing that reminds me the masterpiece of The Room) and on the other hand, Keanu Reeves is the perfect disciple of Robert Michum in this movie.
It is a good movie! sure it goes for a known formula, but still, delivers pretty good action scenes.
Alex was sooo hot in this movie!!!!!!
Kane is Back (Jacob Goodnight) More frightening and Blood thirsty   When I heard there was going to be A second See No Evil I said Please No  But  It's quite good surprisely But a weak storyline but the horror and the killing spree's makes up for that   This movie takes place straight after the fist movie so if you have not the first its totally worth watching have yourself a double feature blood bath  A bit slow in some places some deaths are too fast I wanted to see more suffering (sick man)  WWE movies have got better over time after there shaky start but with great writers and Actors I hope they can produce more worth while productions   If you like horror take a look at this you may enjoy it, for those who liked the 1st movie should not be too disappointed  You just want to see who will survive the killing spree
Worth a watch. Certainly not a 92% as the critic score indicates.
The soundtrack is more memorable than the movie itself. It's passably entertaining, but nothing remotely transcendent.
This movie drags on for way too long. Gets quite boring after a while and gets predictable.
Enjoyable story of former acadamy award screen writer who has not written a hit in years and out of money. He is offered a job as a lecturer at a university and falls in love with the job.
Kind of predictable. Not so great ending.
Cheesy and not bad.  Obviously because of the actually murder of animals, I do not support the purchasing of this movie. Download it or burn it from a friend instead. Don't give them any money.
Solid movie only because of Denzel and also a fan of Colin Ferrell. 
This movie wasn't that bad.
Nice story about a guy with a plan to get rich quick backfiring somehow. Like so many englishes though, he is full of it. This would be a TV movie, pleasantly displaying the local lives. Well played and well developped characters. We get to feel the home in this place with warm and pleasant weather every day.  Romance wins more than money here.
It was ok overall as it was a slow build in the story and then just when it gets interesting, the movie ends abruptly without much fanfare. It had the potential to be better.
To watch Denzel Washington perform in any one of his films is enjoyable. This story of an attorney dedicated to righting the wrongs of society finds himself violating his own principles when a requirement for the basic needs of life overtakes his idealism. If you like Washington, you'll like this performance.
An average mystery that gets a bit slammed in the ratings department. It's not horrible, it's not great. a superb cast really keep the film afloat, and although it's nothing groundbreaking, isn't a total waste of your time
So the entire plot of this movie relies on the premise of someone literally not reading the terms of a loan and also mortgaging her property to pay for a single wedding; yes, the moneylender absolutely took advantage of her trusting nature and apparent illiteracy, but that's partially on her.  A massive influence on the development of Bollywood, Mother India is a multi-generational epic that incorporates conventional values of the divine in Hinduism and their role in the emerging Indian state, with Nargis' Radha serving as the embodiment of the nation in her purity, virtue, and righteous suffering; she (as India) is well-intentioned and dedicated, withstanding the abuses of those that would seek to take advantage of her for personal gain. It's thematically straightforward and easily understandable, but understandably empathetic to citizens of the then-internationally-nascent Indian state. The production value is intermittently mixed (with some questionable set design and editing choices that highlight some of its limitations) but is certainly colorful and can reach soaring heights for mid-20th century Indian cinema; the practical effects of the flood scene are impressive even today. The combination of serious drama and singing is distinctly Indian and not really to my taste (made worse by the fact that the version I viewed did not provide subtitles for the musical numbers for some reason), but that doesn't make it an objective detractor. There's also plenty of other strange choices to nitpick - the rough acting (with the notable exception of Nargis), the heavy melodrama, and the excessive runtime; it all adds up to an important work in the history of film, but not necessarily a great viewing experience in the modern day. It is a bit odd to think that Nargis was married to Dutt, who played her son in this film, and their fictitiously incestuous relatinshiop resulted in one of the most popular Hindi actors in the late 20th century, Sanjay Dutt. (3/5)
Roman J. Israel, Esq. is an okay film. It is about Roman J. Israel who is a driven and idealistic defense attorney. Denzel Washington and Colin Farrell give decent performances. The script is a little slow in places and also a little boring. Dan Gilroy did an alright job directing this movie. I liked this motion picture because of the drama.
Way better than reviews; which I read but don't go by. Was creepy & gory but saw alone on NFlix & didn't h gross out. ***FYI: NOT a T& A slasher vid***
I liked it!  I thought JL was great!
I won't say it's necessarily a "good" movie but it's fun and lighthearted. If you liked it as a kid, like I did, you may still enjoy it now. If you're watching for the first time as an adult, you'll probably regret it.
not bad superhero pic
A failed high school romance and one more chance to fix it in the later years.  Based on one of the Nicholas Sparks book of the same name. The story of a failed high school romance who meet again later in their lives. But the flashback comes right away after the initial segment to reveal theirs young romance and what made them part away. Between the present and the past, it keeps up the momentum and concludes the tale with a twist. Though you would know mile away what's coming.  I did not like all the films based on the stories from the original author. But this one looked okay to me, not so good or too bad. All his films are romance theme, but in this film, that part was very weak. I did not expect that, particularly emotionless when compared to his other flicks. Still, the filmmaking was decent, with the good actors. But the casting was confusing at the beginning for having two sets of actors and then soon it cleared out all the doubts.  Kind of supernatural theme, but not a fantasy. Feels a bit long, because the story developments were slow and most of the parts are not interesting. This is not a romance film I was looking for, but different where everything was dragged to the final twist, especially since the accident that happened at the opening. I did not watch it till now, because I did not feel I wanted to after watching its trailer. But I knew some day I would see it and that is now. I don't know what you thought of it, but for me it is an average film.  6/10
I came in knowing to have low standards but Tommy Lee Jones and Morgan Freeman can always put on a real show even if the plot is such rubish.
This has to be one of the most unusual films I've seen, on the one hand its ultra-modern sets offer a perfect skewering of  urban life.On the other hand the film is so cluttered at points that it drifted away from me the longer I watched it.
I was 8 or 9 the first time I saw this film and it scared the crap out of me then!  FOOD OF THE GODS holds a tremendous amount of nostalgia for me as one of the first "Horror movies" I ever saw in my life.  It's a B-Movie... make no mistake.  It's the kind of flick you could only see as a second feature at a drive-in or at 2 in the morning in the high 20's on your television dial.  All things considered.... FOOD OF THE GODS is actually much better filmed and acted than it needs or deserves to be which might actually hold your interest through what must be considered "horrible" effects by today's standards.  Still... it is nice to watch an old-school horror film from the 70's that's free of CG and filled with earnest and honest attempts to frighten.  FOOD OF THE GODS is silly.... but it boasts probably the greatest use of miniatures in contrast with  real, live animals ever committed to film (The scene where giant rats attacking a Volkswagen Beetle is still particularly good when viewed through a late 70's cinematic prism) ...  FOOD OF THE GODS a guilty pleasure of mine that I dig out and watch every once in a while.
A worthwhile thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously and keeps you interested with fine performance from all involved. PS quite unintentionally funny as well in the best way possible
I think the critics went all in on this because of the subject matter.
was expecting more but the last movie of Gitai: Disengagement is fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
cheesy but its a classic in my book
Have you ever been called a "homo?"  This isn't just a question for those among my audience who choose, however sinfully, to lie with a man as they do with a woman.  (Or vice versa, I s'poose, though as far as I can tell, the bible's okay with dyking out.)  This is really for anyone.  And I don't mean in jest, by a friend, like you're looking at some bath oils and commenting on how fabulous they are and they call you a "homo."  No, I'm asking, "Has a complete stranger ever come up to you and said, 'homo,' as though that was a complete sentence?"  See, it's never happened to me, and it just sounds odd that it's happened to anyone.  It's not that I'm surprised at the homophobia--someone yelled "faggot" at me once from the inside of a moving car.  Or at least I think it was "faggot."  It may have been "pancakes," but by the time I thought to explain the Doppler Effect to them and ask them what exactly they meant, they were long gone.  The "faggot" didn't even make any sense in context, as I was neither having any sort of gay moment nor dressed as a cigarrette.  No, I'm talking about being specifically called "homo."  See, "faggot" I can see, or the more informal "fag," as they sound like proper insults.  I myself prefer "shirtlifter" for its' classiness or "cocksucker" for its' accuracy, but "faggot" would seem to be the go-to phrase for inferring someone has an alternative sexual orientation.  "Homo" sounds too vague, as it could stand for anything--"homo sapien," which we all are, "homo erectus," which we once were, "homogenized," which my milk is, "homonucleus," which--well, you get the point.  Just calling someone "homo" out loud, and not in jest, comes off as silly, and matters are not helped by the two rhyming "o" sounds that give the thing a downright jovial, bumbling Fatty Arbucklesque tone.  No, the only time I've ever heard "homo" uttered in a homophobic sense is in gay-themed movies where gay writers are writing one-dimensional straight characters as total 'phobes.  Or '80s teen comedies, but they exist in their own universe and were never meant as representations of reality.  It seems like every time a character in a gay-themed film is supposed to come off as a jerk, it's all "homo" this and "homo" that.  C'mon, guys, give it up and break out the "fag"s already.  It's not too bad in [i]Hate Crime[/i], as there's enough of interest elsewhere to forgive the occasional tresspass.  "Homo"-spouting jerkwad Chris Boyd (Chad Donella) moves next door to nice, well-to-do gay couple Robbie and Trey (Seth Peterson and Brian J. Smith) in the suburbs.  After Chris scowls a lot and stalks them a little, Trey goes for a walk in the park and finds himself beaten and put into a coma.  Everyone suspects Chris, but nobody can prove it, and the detective on the case (Giancarlo Esposito) seems to actually think Robbie did it for the insurance money.  From here the film becomes kind of a low-rent, queer [i]Death Wish[/i], as Robbie and Trey's mom (ex-[i]Ferris Bueller [/i]mom Cindy Pickett) team up to get revenge.  Still, it's a film more intent on dealing with emotional reaction to crimes like this than becoming an outright exploitation film, so the plot twists are kept to a minimum and the bazookas are kept in the closet.  That said, the film's major plot twist can be seen nearly an hour before it happens, just because it becomes obvious when the gay bashing isn't shown that there is, in fact, a plot twist to come and there's a limited number of other characters to accuse.  It also relies on that old standby of [i]American Beauty[/i] syndrome--those that come off as the most homophobic are, in fact, closet cases--that sounds a lot better in dramatic context than it's ever been proven to be in reality.  (If anyone can show me different, send me a link--I'm not talking about some anti-gay politician cruising gay web sites, I'm talking about actual, scientific, statistical proof that homophobia is [i]likely[/i] to cover up for homosexuality.)  Still, the cast is very good, and the relationship at the film's center is convincing enough for the act of violence to have a real emotional impact.  Strong support from the likes of Lin Shaye (as a neighbor), Bruce Davison (as Chris' pastor father) and Susan Blakely (as his mom) help quite a bit, as does Esposito's detective, who presents a more genuine portrayal of the subtle homophobia that's more prevelent than the aggressive hatred on display in most films of this sort.  [i]Hate Crime[/i] isn't a perfect film, but it's a step in the right direction, and I'd like to see more like it.  As [i]Hate Crime[/i] is to the vigilante revenge film, [i]Hard[/i] tries to be to the serial killer film, but it fails almost so spectacularly that it made my head hurt.  The plot concerns a closeted police detecive (Noel Palomaria) who ends up meeting up with a serial killer (Malcolm Moorman) that ties him to a bed, steals his badge, and gets away, leaving the badge in the mouth of his next victim and, yep, causing the detecive to become a suspect and forced to out himself to prove his innocence.    Getting back to the "homo" rant, Hard sets itself up as a statement on how gay cops are treated by the force but soon belabors the point to where it defies all rational reasoning.  Watch as the detective finds "FAG" painted on the back of his car--the first day he's outed.  Did someone actually take the effort to go to the store and buy paint just to desecrate his car?  This seems like an awful lot of effort to take, especially by characters who have been kind of set up to not really give a shit about what other people do.    Meanwhile, the serial killer sub-plot manages to get sillier and sillier in a valiant attempt to outrage the audience.  The killer stalks and kills "teenagers" (or at least overage actors playing teenagers) in his abandoned warehouse (!) after raping them, all while living with his married lover (likable Michael Waite, in the film's best performance), whose 11-year-old kid he molests.  He also puts a staple gun to the cat's head for no particular reason.  While this does lead to the insanely horrific line, "At least I loved you enough that I didn't kill your son after I raped him," which caused me to burst into a giggle-fit (I am [i]so[/i] going to hell.), it doesn't really make any sense at all, especially at the end of the movie where the killer tries to explain himself.  See, whenever a serial killer tries to explain his actions, the writer has to be very careful.  The explanation doesn't have to make sense from a rational standpoint, but it does have to make sense from a logistical standpoint through the killer's eyes.  If the killer doesn't have a logistical reason to kill, just make him a generic crazy guy and have him shot.    The killer here explains that he is "saving [the victims] from a life on the streets," which I suppose would make sense if he only killed street kids.  He doesn't.  He kills random hicthhikers, he molests kids, he staples cats, he torments cops.  He could have said, "I saw their head-flesh as the gateway to the planet Zssonytnx and I knew I had to destroy it with my super-Earth sperm by jamming it into their skulls," and it would have made [i]perfect sense[/i], at least from his point of view.  The actual reasoning?  No sense at all.  The irrational script is the major reason [i]Hard[/i] is so awful, but it's not as though it would be great even if David Mamet had stopped by to do a rewrite.  You'd still have to put up with the mediocre acting, lack of genuine suspense and a completely unsympathetic lead character.  In the end, Hard is worthwhile only as a curiosity with its' desperate attempts to shock that end in snickers rather than gasps.  It's not even as fascinatingly bizarre as [i]Cruising[/i] or as nihilistically depraved as [i]Frisk[/i], so even among the limited genre of gay-themed serial killer films, [i]Hard[/i] just isn't worth a look.  I'm all for making more exploitation films with gay themes, but unless there's something behind them other than, "gay people are good and homophobia is bad," it's probably better that they shy away from the commentary and go straight for the jugular.  We homos deserve a good slasher film eventually, after all.
Okay nice and creepy but what's the point?
Free fire is a simple concept for a film but for the most part it works. Performances are good and the movie sure does have a lot of shooting mostly confined in it’s one location. Some of the editing is a bit choppy and while the movie isn’t even 90 minutes long it does start to drag a little towards the middle. Think of it almost as a stage production with a bunch of characters shooting at each other.
Too similar to other movies I've seen so it was like watching a movie i had already seen
More pff piece than documentary. Interesting fella
I'm a fan of James Franco and I like Kate Hudson just wish she would make better movie choices and they aren't the problem with this movie. Tom Wilikinson is also in this and he is one of those actors that can do no wrong. The plot has alot of potential to be a very good suspense thriller but the intensity just isn't there. The climax is unique but gets ridiculous after a while. Franco and Hudson have fine chemistry and I would like to see them do something else. It isn't terrible but it isn't very special
the indian guy and ferrell are funny...poehler sucks...as usual
Strangely enough, an ending is precisely what this meandering, bloated, self-important melodrama needs, but its lack thereof, one might suppose, aptly enables the film to authentically live up to the essence of its title. It's truly unfortunate also that the picture features a bevy of excellent performances in search of a story in which to place them. Ultimately, however, fine acting and stylish production values aren't enough to save a film that fundamentally doesn't bring its narrative to satisfying or even ironically ambiguous closure.
Very cutsy, very predictable, but there was still a lot more depth (and humor) to it than I was expecting. If the two female leads had better chemistry, I might have really enjoyed this.
Ryan Pinkston is obnoxious to look at and hear, but obviously that's the reason why he was cast for the role which he performs very well in. The film starts very promisingly and has a funny and original script, then the cliches come thick and fast but still the film is compelling to watch and is a fun tv film to fill in time.
At some point, I realized Netflix (or was it Amazon?) was recommending movies to me because they were connected to Quentin Tarantino. The spaghetti western in question here was mentioned in Quentin's KILL BILL. As a matter of fact, part of the score was also stolen, and bits of the revenge story ripped off. At least Tarantino was up front about what he was doing. I guess.  In DEATH RIDES A HORSE, (the more popular title for this flick,) Director Giulio Petroni (who never directed much else,) casts perennial fan favorite Lee Van Cleef in one of his first starring roles. If you don't already know... There's never been anyone in a western more believable than Van Cleef. John Phillip Law is also surprisingly good, as our other bloodthirsty revenge-seeker.  I dare you to watch this one and not become invested in seeing the bad guys get what is owed them, and the friendship/rivalry between the men pursuing them. A simple story, but well-paced and plotted. At least one scene you won't soon forget. And a hell of an ending.
A reasonable B movie, but a junk A movie.
You get what you pay for here and nothing more 2.8
A good movie with a decent storyline but not better than the first one...
Conta a história de um ex-soldado que mora com a mãe e sofre de problemas psicológicos. Ótima atuação de David Oyelowo, que atua sozinho durante todo filme. A direção e a edição do filmes são muito bem feitas e precisas, dando o dinamismo necessário para captar a atenção do espectador. Interessante a mistura de câmera do personagem com câmera do filme.
some good 70's moments,just needed a better director for this great cast.
Sometimes I wonder how movies get made. This film's logline: A married man has an affair with his best friend's daughter. Somehow, despite the film being a John Waters-type taboo, I bought into it. Afterwards, I felt cheated out of Rio and of the plot. But, Michael Caine in un-unlikeable. You can't hate him. He's just too great. Demi Moore in an early role flirts with a really dark character... But eventually turns out to be a living plot device. The harlot daughter is a pretty terrible actress. I'm not surprised this didn't end unconventionally in the 80s. I'm left thinking this film might actually be more successful now, because we seem to better capable at taking risks.
I am a fan of Denzel. However, I felt like it was somehow left unended.
Interesting police drama. Ending is a bit cliche, but well acted movie.
Blinded by the Light is a well acted, and crafted film. The only problem is that the story does what almost every biopic does today, they have a problem including there childhood, they confront the problem and become a new person, they get a girlfriend, and then the emotional climax is when a protest happens. Again, if this changed some things up I really like this movie, its just so predictable. The musical aspect is pretty cringe worthy, I don't know if its supposed to be but its so cringe worthy, I had to cover my ears for a whole 2 minutes. So 6/10, just get rid of the musical aspects.
Saroo's journey to finding his birth mother is surrounded by wonderful struggles and immense hope. Both wonderful performances and the sympathetic yet raw handling of the true events gives this movie a great heartwarming finish.
Very well made rendition of a truly inspiring Milkha Singh. Farhan Akhtar does a fantastic job as always of living the role. Slick editing and screenplay. Other than the movie being 30 min too long, it's a great show.
Mediocre take on the werewolf genre that lives from its two charismatic protagonists.
This is a movie that makes you cheer for the protagonist to find his family. The story and some characters are great and the emotion is raw, but some scenes are boring and creates a disinterested to the other characters that are undercooked.
Pretty good little indie sci-fi flick
Great acting, cool story, but real long and prob didn't need to be.
Great body of actors and actresses. Not a bad watch. Decent plot with a pretty good level of action.
Maybe some parts are missing from the book and some have changed but the same feelings and emotions.
Denzel still got it. My aunt and I were very much entertained by the standard story and strong lead, McCall as portrayed by Denzel.
Compelling documentary from The Greatest's own collection of personal recordings
This is actually kind of sweet. You think things couldn’t possibly work, but then you keep watching to find a different truth. 
on one hand this film is perfection. Exquisitely designed and decorated with a setting that I love; a cast that is superb with every role and cinematography that looks so damned authentic to the period.  Yet I have a huge problem with the overall narrative and the cohesion to the story and that ultimately sells the film short. this film is almost like they had a 100 great scenes to shoot and when they put it together they forced it without smoothing out the edges. That and they definitely were paying homage to GoodFellas. It was almost as if this was really just deleted scenes from the Scorsese classic. Still, my type of movie all the way.
Free Zone is an interesting film. It made me want to go out and see Israel and Jordan. However often times unless you had an atlas in front of you, you got lost with what they were talking about. The dialogue has a very documentary feel to it. Hana Laszlo is a genuine actress and her abilities flow well with Natalie Portman who is Israel's best export to the US.
Some stuff makes animals grow and people are attacked by giant rats. Not good persÃ (C), but the special effects are most of the time quite believable. Also deserves credit for the most unbelievable childbirth ever.
Spoilers....  I like a movie with no hope.
This is really slow paced.. but the characters are great and it has a lovely mix of comedy and drama,romantic with some sweet moments - alex O'lachlan is really great in this film..
Daddy's Home can't decide how ridiculous it wants to be. In some parts, it acts like a straightforward situational comedy, but then at other times it is completely cartoonish. It also wanders between family-friendly entertainment and immature innuendos without finding its footing on either side. And yet, for some reason, I still found myself somewhat enjoying it. What's up with that?
Recently watched it on Netflix. I liked it a lot! It is indeed slow haha, but I thought it made its point.
Monster Trucks is surely targeted for children and preteens but theres still a little to enjoy if youre older than twelve. The movie is weirdly interesting and the acting is surprisingly good. The visuals arent so bad either in comparison to similar films. I personally found it quite entertaining on a boring Thursday night so if youre looking for a fun flick to pass the time, Monster Trucks is worth the watch.
One thing is certain.. Every people has rights to tell their feeling... At least, getting to know the answer despite wasting time for hoping..
It was not as bloody as the first one and it was a bit like Jason Friday the 13th kind of thing it was alright
Brendan Frasier looks remarkably like Robert Pattinson. I'm just saying, it's hypnotic.
Decent watch, probably won't watch again, but can recommend.  The biggest problem with this is that it is just awkward.  Rainn Wilson is really good, but odd as a straight man.  He was a serious, but goofy character in "The Office", but this is different: he's serious bordering on sad here with a marriage in jeopardy.  The oddest bit is that this is the one movie that Kira Mclean has stared in, she not only leads this movie well, but carries the movie easily.  She goes all in with young teen angst in each of the story lines she's in as she's in every story line except for the weirdness with mom almost leaving dad.  This is a fine movie, it's a decent coming of age story, "new kid at the school", renewed love, and "finding self" all mixed together, but it's just presented in the weirdest way possible, which I think is all for the setting of "small hick town".
That was ok : worth 7 out of 10. Quite scary in parts, but not fully developed.
Very good acting led by Rush, Hammer, and Shalhoub. However, be prepared for a film that can be trying at times with its disjointed storyline and most deliberate pacing. For me, the subtle humor and eccentric, unpredictable, and full of life characters made it worth the experience.
One thing that is quite amazing about this film is the very beautiful visualization, making us feel as if we were carried away in that magical garden. Good job because it can visualize the imagination for the readers of the novel. This film has a warm tone so it is suitable for family films. This film also tells about how sadness can lead someone to unnatural behavior, lock themselves up, and do anything to block access that can lead to sad memories. Children in fact have the ability to think more logically than adults. However, the storyline is boring and monotonous, the ending is predictable.
It was ok, but like I have been describing to anyone who will listen:  wouldn't this be a MUCH better movie if Lawrence gets awakened by Pratt, begins to accept their life and fall in love, and then one day finds other empty sleep pods.  Accessing the computer memory she discovers video showing that she is actually the 4th woman Pratt has awakened, and when the previous women have fought with him or just annoyed him, he just ejects them into space?   Now she has to pretend to be affectionate and to please him while she figures out how to survive and maybe kill him first?  THAT's a great movie.
Sleight is well acted and quite interesting in its premise, but underutilized and familiar in its execution with uninspired drama elements, dull and forgettable characters and too many typical scenes. A disappointing indie flick.
These three stars are left over from how much I loved the first one. I love the characters. They make my heart go <3 but the movie is not very good. I wish it was better very much
vedibile ma niente di travolgente...
Rien d'extraordinaire, une 'romantic comedy' un peu au-dessus des mievreries qu'on sait parfois nous pondre. Un role de composition pour Duchovny (joke)!
Don't believe me when I say it wasn't scary enough, I couldn't watch it alone in a million years. I really liked the idea too, trying to prove all the spells and rituals wrong, succeeding in some and being possesed and going crazy in the end. Some scenes were very creepy as well.
typical will ferrel comdy with a new crazy guy. Few raunchy laughs and gross humour. Watch for a time-pass nothing comedy
If anyone watches it twenty years, they would not guess it was a film released in 2014
The Secret Garden is a beautiful film to watch and holds true to the original story, while getting just a tad darker.
This fell into the typical cliché riddled story mode and it lost all the hard work created in the first film. They never invested enough time in the friendship to pull off this story beat and the film doesn't work. I enjoyed the first film and when you compare the films, the sequel is less interesting story wise. Washington is the key here and even he cannot rescue the contrived plot chosen by the filmmakers. I wanted to like this film and the action can only compensate for so much. The supporting plots felt uninspired and with only a few of the subplots paying off. Good action scenes but a friend death that means nothing and serves zero purpose is wasted. Hopefully they can redeem themselves with a third film. 08/08/2019
This French-American crime thriller directed by Guillaume Canet and fully financed by the French, is a remake of 2008 French thriller Les liens du sang by Jacques Maillot. That French movie was an adaptation of the French novel of the same name by Bruno and Michel Papet. The screenplay for this version was written by Canet and James Gray and somehow the end product was weird and unusual version happening in the '70s... well everything would be ok with me if the camera work was like from the70's, and the technology has improved  a lot since then! The best part of this movie belongs to the performances of Clive Owen, Billy Crudup, Marion Cotillard, Mila Kunis, and Matthias Schoenaerts. Their likable characters and  acting skills must be the reason that this film was selected to be screened out of competition at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.  Simple story develops quickly ... after being released from prison, Chris (Clive Owen) tries to do the right thing and stay straight, but that didn't last long because he was almost unable to start a new life and soon returns to his criminal ways. This puts him in direct conflict with his brother Frank (Billy Crudup), a New York cop.  I enjoyed watching the charismatic cast, but story wasn't engaging enough - we stayed spectators only - until the end! The directing too safe, sometimes on the edge of boredom... this is the simplest way to describe what I just watched. If there is nothing better, go for it...  it is watchable, and if you are a fan of the cast members  - do not miss it!
If anyone watches Blood Ties in twenty years, they would not guess it was a film released in 2014.
Bob Ho (Jackie Chan) is an undercover CIA superspy who decides to give up his career in espionage to settle down with his next-door neighbor and girlfriend, Gillian (Amber Valletta). But Bob has one more mission to complete before Gillian agrees to marry him: winning over her three opinionated kids. When Gillian suddenly has to leave town, Bob volunteers to babysit the children so he can earn their approval. But when one of the kids mistakenly downloads a top-secret formula from his computer, Bob's archenemy, a Russian terrorist, moves in for the attack, forcing Bob to juggle the roles of spy and prospective stepfather in the most challenging mission of his career!  also stars Madeline Carroll, George Lopez, Billy Ray Cyrus, Will Shadley, Alina Foley, Mangus Scheving and Katherine Boecher.  directed by Brian Levant.
The series should have stopped at the first. This sequel was unnecessary and made me start to dislike a lot of the characters that I loved from the first movie.
Sure, it's another romantic comedy. When are the plots ever anything stellar? The thing is, I actually liked the characters in this movie - unexpected, and refreshing. Matthew Goode is utterly adorable and Lena Headey is always a welcome sight. Cute and light.
The studio synopsis says "EVERYBODY KNOWS (TODOS LO SABEN) follows Laura (Cruz) on her travels from Argentina to her small home town in Spain for her sister's wedding, bringing her two children along for the occasion. Amid the joyful reunion and festivities, the eldest daughter is abducted. In the tense days that follow, various family and community tensions surface and deeply hidden secrets are revealed." Ah, if only the story was that simple but when you are dealing with 10 plus family manners, an ex-boyfriend, a kidnapping, money problems, alcoholics, estates, a winery not to forget such red herrings as a young boy wearing bright red glasses you can understand why the movie is 132 minutes long. It takes about twenty minutes to get the story going with some characters dismissed quickly and others getting more time than necessary.  To be honest I could just watch Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem alone on screen just talking but the fact that they were sweethearts when younger is referred to as a plot point and then sort of forgotten though they spend more time on screen than any other actor.  At times the movie is a telenovela, other times a mystery thriller but most times jumps all over the place that it doesn't quite make sense. With the kindness of a lady sitting nearby, reminding us of something that happened at the beginning of the movie, the explanation of the mystery sort of made sense.  "Everybody Knows" isn't a must-see movie but if you are a fan of Cruz and/or Bardem, and I am, plus like scenic movies, you might not get involved with the convoluted story but you will enjoy the movie
Non malaccio peccato che finisca in una zombata, sottogenere della fantascienza che non amo.
Whitney Houston makes her big screen debut as a superstar singer and actress who begins receiving an alarming amount of death threats.  She hires Kevin Costner, a retired detective, to be her bodyguard and he sets out to protect her from any potential harm.  The film boasts a great soundtrack of some of Houston's best known songs but it is not passionate enough to be romantic nor is it suspenseful enough to be a thriller.  What you have is a middling drama with no sparks being lit off between the two leads; and an anti-climactic conclusion that leaves much to be desired.
A little too bland. Solid acting. Her relationship with the charming man that is looking to build in an area she is trying to protect is the most interesting aspect of the movie in my opinion, it is during their interactions that the movie no longer seems flat.
Movie had a great twist. I was guessing throughout the movie who the killer was, and I couldn't figure it out. But overall I was disappointed because I didn't find it very entertaining.
It's not that good compare to other movies of Stephen Chow, but it's okay to watch
Even though I did like this movie better than I thought I would, adding magic tricks to the movie, although entertaining, didn't cover up the fact that we've heard  this story a thousand times before. I will give credit to the fact that this is one of the better movies to come out of WWE studios, the whole "kid falls in with the wrong crowd and wants to get out of the drug dealing gang banger life" is an old and WAY too played out story.
Keanu Reeves is beginning to head into Bruce Willis territory and it's a massive shame. Outside of John Wick he has started to star in these poorly marketed and produced films that shouldn't attract such a gifted acting presence. The film is very slow but ramps up in the final third to have some recommendation for viewing. I'm a little lost why this attracted a gifted director and Reeves, surely someone e.g. manager to identify this wasn't a good film for their client. I liked the film but clearly didn't love the film, there is enough here to watch but it's ultimately flawed. The film has that John Wick vibe which might have duped audiences into viewing this film, typical marketing ploy. The film could have been better, that is not sugar coating it. The storyline had the opportunity to sharpen the narrative and allow the film to add further depth, but as it stands the film is a one watch and forget sadly. 05/08/2018.
Man this is such a odd movie, but I pretty much dig it. The parts that was really good was the scares, the Jinn itself, the action, and even the music. It's really well made on the technical side. The acting was either okay or kinda cheesy. There's a cliche story with the main couple but it plays into the story later on pretty effectively. It's weird, I can't pin point what type of film it wants to be, because it's a straight demon film that turns into sorta like a Army of Darkness or Phantasm II action film. I'd say it's worth checking out if you're a horror fan.
There were a few plot holes and loose ends in this film.
Twisted is your typical thriller that has a obligatory, game-changing twist at the end. Ashley Judd is as gorgeous as always, while Garcia and Jackson phone-in performances that really don't require a lot of effort from them.  suspense thriller without thrills or suspense.
Good 3D, good special effect. However, the script is weak and dull dialogue(though I watched original Mandarin version). Also, Kris Wu and Lin Gengxin did very bad, and definitely miscast.  I believe that it can be a good movie if Stephen Chow directs by himself, not Tsui Hark. They both are different styles and don't match with each other.  I did enjoy the first one, which was surprisingly good. But now this sequel is quite disappointed. (2.5 out of 5)
Blood Ties is a 70's crime drama that not only is a remake of a 2008 French film (Les liens du sang), but it also feels familiar to other films in the genre. One that came to mind while watching this film was James Gray's We Own the Night considering it deals with two brothers who are on different sides of the law. Ironically I found out after the film that the screenplay was adapted by director Guillaume Canet with the help of Gray himself. Despite that, I enjoyed this film because I like 70's crime dramas but it really didn't add anything to the genre and it was very predictable. The ensemble cast in Blood Ties is probably the strongest asset of the film, although I have to admit the production design was also pretty strong as it gave the film an authentic 70's vibe. Blood Ties is a great film to look at, and the actors all give strong performances, but the issue I had with this film beside the fact that it was predictable was that every gray character in the film was given a redemptive scene every time something bad was going to happen to them. I felt this was kind of a weak shot to manipulate the audience's feelings and try to engage them emotionally. It really took me out of the movie because it happens throughout the film with various characters. Blood Ties is still worth a shot if you enjoy crime dramas or if you like the talented cast involved. The performances stand out in an otherwise predictable and standard film.   Blood Ties is a remake of a French film that also happened to be based on a French novel written by Michel and Bruno Papet. The screenplay for this film, which was adapted and relocated to New York, was written by Guillaume Canet and James Gray. Canet had previously starred in the original French film as one of the brothers. The film takes place during the 70's and it centers on a rather dysfunctional family. Two siblings, Frank (Billy Crudup) and Marie (Lili Taylor), await for their brother Chris (Clive Owen) to be released from prison. Frank happens to be a promising police officer, and he tries to help Chris stay away from trouble by finding him a job and giving him a fresh start. The first thing they do after they release Chris is visit their father, Leon (James Caan) at the hospital, who has just had one of his lungs removed. Next Frank takes Chris to visit his ex wife, Monica (Marion Cotillard) and their two children, although she doesn't seem to happy about it. Frank allows Chris to stay at his apartment, but eventually Chris's past catches up with him when he falls for the beautiful Natalie (Mila Kunis) whom he wants to provide a better life for. Frank is also trying to reconnect with a former lover, named Vanessa (Zoe Saldana), who has a daughter and is in a relationship with a man who he just put behind bars (Matthias Schoenaerts from Rust and Bone). As Chris reconnects with his criminal life, it puts Frank at an awkward position in his job as the two paths are destined to crash at one point.  Marion Cotillard is terrific once again in this film. There is one scene where she doesn't say anything, but the look in her eyes say it all. She is just a supporting character, but every time she is on screen she steals the show. Billy Crudup is the lead here and he delivers a solid performance. His character is more reserved, but he expresses his inner struggles very well. Clive Owen was on a role between 2004 and 2009 starring in several great films, but I haven't seen much from him since. He gives a solid performance here and easily one of his best over the past 5 years. Mila Kunis isn't given much to work with, but she does her job. Every character in this film seemed to have some important role and the casting was brilliant. Blood Ties is a decent film, the only problem is that the source material has been covered before making the story seem predictable.
Not as funny as the title.
a good premise, as well as a good vs, evil flick, but  not very well played out Spoiler alert - as if almost everyone doesn't now - magnets don't interact with  plastic, bullets, coins, etc. Hard to suspend belief when such a premise is used
It is a world of men, and so all female characters are one-dimensional and revolve around them, while Billy Crudup delivers the only nuanced performance in a weak movie filled with too many characters who are mostly underdeveloped and make it lose focus like a soap opera.
Incredibly crude, hot-mess-of-a-story, British movie
A rather bland political thriller, The Gunman clumsily tries to mix action with political conspiracy.  The story follows a former military contractor named Jim Terrier whose past comes back to haunt him when a group of mercenaries come looking for him.  The action is pretty good, but the politics are extremely ham-fisted and aren't incorporated into the film very well.  Featuring Sean Penn, Javier Bardem, and Ray Winstone, the cast is quite impressive and they give some strong performances.  However, the script is weak and does give them much to work with.  Still, there's a fair amount of mystery and suspense as Terrier tracks down those who are behind the attempts to kill him, and learns who he can and cannot trust.  The Gunman isn't really a bad film, it's just poorly executed.
Welll...there are some funny scenes...Not bad... ;)
Jackie Chan was the only good part of this movie, rest of the cast was totally boring.
I loved the storyline and the characters, but, it went over the top too many times. If they had just dialed it back a little bit....
As well intentioned as Reichardt may have been, this really is just three shorts. The first one works fairly well, but that was really just the acting. The second is a drab, seemingly pointless ramble. The third, however, is pretty affecting in both the story, direction and acting.
Clocking in at 120 minutes, The Standford Prison Experiment struggles to maintain focus, but the acting prevents it from completely falling apart.
Pitch Perfect 3 fails to capture the magic of the first movie and the charm of its predecessor resulting in a disappointing addition to the franchise and a poor excuse to create a trilogy.
a short-nerdy-wierdo looking guy is a newbie at a high school. To impress everyone around him and to be one of the "Cool" kids he starts lying about himself. Suddenly, one day all his lies start coming true and thats when he gets all that he wanted and some things which he did not want.  Story was interesting enough, with direction & screen play lacking in quality. It was funny at times but then became very stupid later.  Recommendation: Its not a very good m0vie to watch. Though if you are really bored and want some teenage high-school stuff then go for it!
Just finished watching this on DVD and it was a waste of time. Honestly, I fast forwarded through the last 1/3 of the movie because it was a bit slow and the buildup to the anticlimactic end was a disappointment. Not recommended.
Wasted cast and horrible dialogue. Nothing moves forward for far too long while the director and actors seem to struggle with everything. The female sexuality thing is very poorly handled too, which is all the worse as the plot hangs (and is hanged) by it.  Worth watching at least once as it does have some entertainment value and holds together enough to make you wonder how it ends, but it's un-necessarily hard work as it could have been better with minimal effort, (the soundtrack is poor for instance - abit like Carpenter's 70s stuff). Still...2% is harsh. Rotten Tomatoes mass hysteria methinks.
It had some pretty good ideas and it was generally pretty creepy.  But it lacked in story and depth.  Some of the acting felt pretty mediocre. i liked the makeup and visuals though.  It was a pretty decent clown movie.  I'm pretty tired though, and I'll say I'm about to go to sleep without any worries of clowns.
This could've been another thoroughly entertaining Bert I. Gordon oversized flick... but he opted to blow up, electrocute and drown live rats on screen, and that's kind of inexcusably cruel. This sort of thing sucks the fun right out of watching horror movies (see: Cannibal Holocaust... or don't)
Not as good as the first one. Lara and Peter lacked chemistry and I just couldn't see them as a couple I wanted to root for. Also, the characters seemed childish, younger than their age was supposed to be. BUT they also talk about their past (e.g. back in the sixth grade) as if It were like 20 years ago! It was weird and kinda boring.
And same fate that befalls most sequels befell this too.
One star each for Denison and Ramirez, half a star for Usher's abs. I love boxing and was really excited for this movie. The Panama scenes were great, and recreating that time period, showcasing the dispute between the US and Panama during that time was an added bonus.   I do, however, cringe at the producer's obvious attempts at trying to add as much gratuitous sex into the movie that it distracted from the story itself, and managed to have me walk away from the movie disliking Roberto Duran. Sure, they made sure they told us numerous times how long Duran and his wife were married, but now knowing he married her at the age of 14, coupled with the very creepy sex scene with the actress who played her (she looked way to young for Ramirez's Duran, but at least she was legal), just left me squirming in my seat. I even overlooked the fact that you had a Velazualan man playing a Panamanian hero and a Cuban playing his wife because it seemed to work out for JLo's career when she played Selena, not to mention, Edgar Ramirez is 10 times the better actor than Lopez, but I still can't let go of the fact that the makers of this movie not only knew the back story behind the age gap, but then exploited the hell out of it because they figured only men would go see this movie. Hollywood is so out of touch with their audiences.
OK run-of-the-mill sci-fi actioner, mildly entertaining, but absolutely predictable. 
'Eternal Beauty' is too often a portrait of cruelty, and not enough kindness.  It is, however, a showcase for the tremendous talents of Sally Hawkins.  At times, I wanted to scratch my eyeballs out, but it's beautiful.  For me, it just wasn't successful at managing the balance that writer and director Craig Roberts was shooting for.  Final Score: 5/10
a good Saturday movie to fall asleep on
The last day on mars is a film with little worth of anything, other than a vehice for Liev Schreiber. Its not intelligent, well acted or anything of the sort. But I dont think its AS bad as everyone is saying. The visuals were good, I guess, and the story at least doesnt attempt to be intelligent. Yes its clichéd and frankly preposterous as a space/mars/virus movie. But I always find fun in these films for the thrill of who's going to die next. I dont really like this film though because its forgettable yet not altogether unwatchable
Certainly wasn’t Days of Thunder, but wasn’t as bad as Speed Kills either. Lame cliche plot...mehhh....
Liked it, Chronicle meets Iron Man!
Oppressively dreary. It may be overwrought for the screen, but "Miss Julie" is a master class in acting. Colin Farrell and Samantha Morton deliver some of their finest work, while Jessica Chastain commands the screen with a towering performance. Chastain's Julie flits around with childlike petulance, scathes with fiery outbursts, then becomes devastatingly unhinged in the final act.
Eli Roth made a Gossipy Story about Clowns making it become a horror movie, it is better to watch it than to see this movie. Eli Roth Did a work Of terror Trash Showing Muita Violencia Explicita Infantil and A Roadmap to Break The Head.
This movie was strangely entertaining with some pretty awful special effects.
The film itself is slow and a little too talky, but it is worth watching for the performance alone. Chastain, Farrell & Morton are everything good about Miss Julie.
This was a very disappointing movie. When I first went into this I was excited because I knew at least two of the actors so I was expecting the performance to be you know enjoyable. But I got the exact opposite. The plot itself is a little bit shaky and can use a little bit of fine-tuning.
Uneven and with little variety in the action scenes 
It's an okay watch. The acting is strong, as is the cast. But, the story is all over the place. it feels like they took a 3 hour movie and edited the hell out of it to reduce the watch time to 2 hours. That leaves a lot of gaps in the story. it was free, so I can't complain, but it's not a must see.
Blood Ties is a remake of a 2008 French film by the name of 'Les liens du sang' starring Guillaume Canet and directed by Jacques Maillot which is based on a French novel of the same name.  This one is directed by Canet and co-scripted by James Gray ... whose own 2007 film 'We Own the Night' closely parallels that same novel source material.  It is the story of two brothers on opposite sides of the law set in the early 1970s with a (too) rocking soundtrack of some awesome 70's tunes.  Billy Crudup (Almost Famous) is the "good son" cop although it is his criminally-inclined older brother Clive Owen (Closer) who appears to be the family favorite.  After spending several years in prison, Chris (Owen) returns home and his younger brother Frank sets him up with a job and home and hopes he has reformed as they have an ailing father (James Caan - The Godfather) who seems to favor the older son.  Zoe Saldana (Avatar), Marion Cotillard (Inception), Lili Taylor (The Conjuring) and Mila Kunis (Black Swan) play various women in their lives.  While the film is never a bad one, its story has been overdone these last couple of years.  The acting is strong for the most part although Owen tries a bit too hard sometimes and I didn't always buy his emotion.  The film looks, feels and sounds very 70's which is a plus ... as this was Canet's aim.  If I hadn't seen the other two films (plus Gray's other film 'The Yards'), this one would feel fresher; but ... it is like having the same meal several times in one week.  If only this one had been served first ...
Started off strong but ended up being boring
"The Whole Truth" is a passable courtroom drama; in the world of straight to DVD there have been worse.
Nice concept and story not too bad.  Acting was pretty good. Major flaw is the butcher being some T1000 Terminator, completely unrealistic and that's where is falls apart, there was several chances to easily kill the "butcher" but there was too much playing around. Like the scene where both deputies rammed his car at both sides and opened fire (No way in hell should he have lived that not a chance). Would be much more believable if he was a hard target to find and the deputies where trying to track him down and prevent anyone else being killed by the list.  Either way it was more a fail on the writers and directors.
Tremendamente predecible, pero bueno, me entretuvo
Gun Shy written and directed by Eric Blakeney. Starring Liam Neeson, Oliver Platt and Sandra Bullock.  Charlie (Liam Neeson) is a veteran undercover DEA agent whose close encounter with death in his last sting operation has left him with a bad case of anxiety. He confesses this to a a psychiatrist who introduces him to a support group of other unhappy men. Fulvio (Oliver Platt) is a mob hit man who is full of anger. They all fall together with two Colombian drug dealers anxious to make some big money and improve their status in the cartel.  Once again Liam Neeson done a movie that is poor and dull, lacks the zeal. A deteriorating story that is all a disaster!
Daddy's Home is a cute but forgettable comedy that is saved by the on-screen chemistry between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg.  The premise is simple: an insecure stepfather wants to be the best dad that he can be, but his desire to be the perfect father is sidelined when the children's biological father shows up and competitive mayhem ensues.  Ferrell and Wahlberg are great in the lead roles and generate a decent number of laughs.  However, the plot is predictable and you know where this thing is going before it's even halfway there.  Other than the scene at the basketball game, there's a good chance that most of Daddy's Home will be forgotten in short order.
I expected to laugh more.  A decent story
I love British crime movies but this one is a mess - disjointed and haphazard Jude Law charms no-one and barely raises a smile...too bad.
More sophisticated than most preteen fare. Definitely has some issues, but the talented cast deals well enough with the preachier moments.
a small thriller with a great cast, but too much focused on the protagonist's liaisons, who forgets she's a cop sometimes, or maybe the director has just this aim, and nothing else. anyway, this is not a crap movie as the critics said, because there's a little action and interest - besides titties and sexual intercourse, I mean.
Watchable I guess. It's a nice little family flick and the fighting scenes are more than enough to catch your attention. The villains are pretty enjoyable and overall it's a pretty good film for kids to enjoy. A lot of cliches, terrible acting (except for Chan of course), and some overall stupid scenes. But it all adds up pretty well in this family flick
Very passable movie if you're in the mood for a typical gothic tale.  I was initially very intrigued by it, and I ended up getting a bit underwhelmed. It's all very well done, well acted, well produced, but the story itself is not that impressive.  The mood of this movie is very mysterious and solid, it keeps up appearances. I was just slightly disappointed with the direction the story went in. Felt like it could've been much more elaborate and unexpected.  I realize it's based on a novel, but I'm still disappointed nothing more could be done with this premise.  So again, it was only passable. Not bad, but not memorable in the slightest.
Average zombie flick which adds zero to the genre....if you missed it you did not miss much.
A story like this demands very charming characters and clever lines... and I was not a bit amused with those in the movie... which is not to say the movie or the actors were bad, nothing really clicked and the whole thing fell flat.
I had low expectations, and that served me well through this average movie, featuring the typical cliches. It wasn't bad, however it could of been a lot better with what it offered in terms of supernatural visuals. It often felt like a children's version of 'The Ring'...
Touching on issues of class, affluent ennui, existentialism, and loyalty, "Miss Julie" is an occasionally compelling and largely dry adaptation that benefits massively from the stellar performances of its cast (Morton and Chastain particularly, both of whom should have been in the Oscar race).
The film has talent and the storyline is quite interesting, but it never comes together. Sadly, the filmmakers or producers chose to have such a short running time. It hurts the film dramatically. The film needed at least another hour with deep exploration on character. You can understand why films have fallen away from cinema release when they run a minuscule 90 minutes. No one has a backstory and it lacks justification towards the end. It's a shame this film underdelivers as it showcases promising actors and strong characters. 15/11/2019
enjoyable if you have nothing else to do...
Worse than the first, but at least To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You is above average for Netflix teen movies.
an alright horror flick
This was not what I expected to be. Not my cup of tea
wild ride of hilarity and angst
Kind of over the penis gag phase, even though the concept is slightly more original than most teen coms we see. Enjoyed the background scenery the most.
Runs like a train going five miles an hour and by the end you just do not care did she or didn't she.
That's a damn fine poster you've got there, Killing Gunther. Unfortunately, it's also indicative of Killing Gunther's biggest problem: Leading the promotional material with Arnold Schwarzenegger. I know, from a marketing standpoint, it makes a hundred and five percent sense, totally get it. But purely in terms of the experience you go through from watching a movie, I feel absolutely certain that Killing Gunther would have been exponentially better if Arnie's involvement was kept secret. It seems very much as if the movie was built that way, and then the direction was changed some time after post-production.  In the end, Killing Gunther is an okay movie, but it might have been *great* if the Gunther character was a genuine reveal in the film, instead of the "Fuckin' finally" moment we ended up with.
I bought this for my girlfriend for10p (brand new). I paid the same for a VHS copy of 'Gossip'. Can anyone beat this? You've got to love The Works!
Poorly made, corny as all hell, and just stupid: for these very reasons, the Giant Gila Monster is an enjoyable b-movie.  The MST3K version is the best way to view this film, though.
My wife read The Glass Castle before we watched this movie, and many of the shocking things she shared with me from the book didn't make it into the film. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to water down and even sugarcoat the true events so that this dysfunctional family could seem more relatable. The problem is, that makes the story less interesting and the movie becomes a bland feel-good indie flick.
Feels non-original but turned out to be fun nonetheless.
The best part of this movie was the very charismatic 'bad people'. I was fooled by James Franco's presence, i thought this could be a good flick but a disappointment with cliches.
Despite my beloved Evan Peters, who I nicknamed the Prince of Horror,  being in this movie it sucked greatly. They even had childish gambino in it although most know him from the tv Community. The movie had plenty potholes and overall didn't make sense. Maybe I'm wrong sometimes it takes a better eye to see things clear.
I HATE vampire movies but this actually wasn't terrible. There's something about this movie that just works for me and I can't pinpoint what it is exactly. All in all though it's a not a well-made film.
Michael King's wife died tragically, he doesn't believe in religion or the supernatural so he decides to make a documentary to debunk the spiritual side of life and to do so goes to demonologists, necromancers and the like to prove they don't exist. Unfortunately for him he ends up being possessed by some evil shit and spends the film trying to fight whatever is trying to take over his soul. Low budget horror with some predictable and nonsensical moments but it will definitely scare the non horror fans, for me it is just not scary, just noisy and a little silly. Definitely some good ideas, could have worked a lot better than what the finished product, budgets and restraints will do that. I'd be interested in what the director does next though.
It starts to be promising, but falling back to genre's stereotype pretty fast.
"Every Secret Thing" has two of my favorite actresses: Diane Lane and Elizabeth Banks. It just left me unsatisfied. It's lacking something that could have make it great.
Decent chemistry, but a bit contrived & wow, so sad.
The best part about this movie is his transformation into the evil clown.  Other than that, it was pretty average.  The acting was ok, the story was ok, the characters were ok.  There are way better horror movies out there.  AVERAGE   2.5/5   OR  5/10
My son liked it well enough. It was a pretty average Mormon feel-good family kinda film.
It's 70% The Purge, 30% Spring Breakers. Assassination Nation works as a fun energetic release of nihilistic violence, more than it does as a satirical but politically charged piece. However, some of its feministic points don't entirely make sense, as if the creators had some good ideas but couldn't figure out how to make them all coherent or transparent by the end of the movie. Lastly, the third act was an extreme letdown.
Dark, depressing and mostly boring to be honest. It had some nightmarish scenes. I didn't like that it was black and white. Disturbing but not in a gory horror movie way.
The film manages to entertain for most of its footage, thanks to the good work of its stars. However, its viewing causes a certain feeling of disappointment as it was not known (or wanted) to exploit the enormous potential of a story that would have worked much better with a greater dose of darkness. What is left in the end is a designer product that is as easy to see as it is predictable and sweetened.
A very, very, very weird version of Castaway where the lead guy played by Paul Dano gets some magical help from the farting corpse of Harry Potter. Watching HP being ridden like a jet ski was indeed a bizarre sight to see. It gets even weirder and weirder, but at least it's not boring and it's a short movie too.
There's a couple goods scenes here involving gonzo violence, drugs, and nudity but it's not really as good as it leads you to believe. Jude Law's hairline is in trouble by the way. Good soundtrack though.
Reasonably entertaining film, but not really quite in the same league as Lee Van Cleef''s work with Sergio Leone and in his two appearances as Sabata.
Agonizingly slow at times, and a very inconsistent film. The heavy handed direction doesn't help. Certainly not a cheery film. Very negative and unappealing. Dylan McDermott does a decent job, but Snoop Dogg is irritating as hell.
the four leads playing off one another made this an Ok watch. not a barrel of laugh-out-loud laughs.
Hulk who sticks out like a sore thorn in a finger, attempts to broaden his horizon and try acting in... cheezy kiddy crap. Mr. Nanny isn't only painful to watch Hulks bold spot get smashed in numerous times, he tries to act. Key word tries... The flick is half funny, and completly tasteless it proves that the Hulk himself in desperate times will stupe lower then most would imagine.
Good People has got all the makings of a direct to video, low budget crime thriller. Although Franco and Hudson gave it their best efforts, this movie doesn't quite cut it as good.
A blanant rip-off from Resident Evil!!!
I thought this was based on a true story the whole time I was watching this even though I couldn't believe how it could be true. And it's not. I'm conflicted on this film. Frances McDormand produces...should have been amazing. Too much going on. Alice completely miscast. Why a story with this horrific subject matter would even be written if not true is a bit scary. Seems like something written for Lifetime.
As much as I wanna see Jason Mamoa and this guy from X-Men. I knew it would be like a straight-to-DVD film which means a B-grade flick. Actually starts pretty cool as you will be into the story for the out most yet through the second half it just reminded me of some episodes from any sci-fi tv shows. Not bad for the whole cast still a watchable B-grade reminds you of a late night film from the 80's. 2.5 out of 5.
I admit its cheesy as hell and awful, but goddamn its hilarious, from the acting to the story to just the concept itself, it was just a good time, especially watching in a group
Interesting in that it may add some depth to the study that many of us Psych students learned of in University.  But as a movie, it was a little dull- the plot was straight forward, characters were average, pace was a little slow... The interesting part about the movie was how they almost vilified the experimenter and his obsession with seeing the experiment thru.
weird and somehow pointless movie
Even though there are a few flaws that can be picked on the Lazarus Effect, the plot and character development made it interesting and retain audience's attention. There was a few moments that definitely gave viewers chill in its storytelling process.
Another disappointing Keanu' movies :(. The movie was slow, meaningless. The two characters' encounter was unusual and nonsense.
"Cursed" tries to be funny and scary; frequently at the same time. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver a compelling experience, relying heavily on cheap jump scares and featuring some god-awful CGI.
I'm no expert but this has to be one of the worst of the 'creature features' from the 1950s. The acting is wooden at best, continuity is all over the place and as for the Shrews themselves, no amount of padding can disguise the fact that they are dogs in large shaggy costumes.
Cheesy. Not worth watching.
Hands down one of the most boring and all over the place films I’ve seen Washington do in some years. You could tell the message they wanted to say but it got lost somewhere 
The effects are dated but might be somewhat forgivable if the script weren't so bad.  Sure, the story is preposterous but it might have been done okay except for the bizarre reactions to everything.  After being attacked by a GIANT chicken, the hero acts as if he were just attacked by someone's guard dog.  Then he solves the "mystery" of the film in about five seconds.  Wow.
A powerful woman fights to save a kid who was meant to die. I actually went to see Ultraviolet In theaters when it first came out with one of my closest friends. Sixteen minutes into the movie, he walked out to the screen next door to watch Dave Chappelle's Block Party. Yes, it is that bad and, honestly, I'm surprised he even lasted that long. What's my excuse? I don't know, I'm guess I'm a glutton for bad-movie punishment. I paid the dime so I was forcing myself to do the time.  Acting: 0  Beginning: 3 No, it doesn't take sixteen minutes to decide this movie is horrible. It's really more like ten. The beginning sets the movie up in no particularly clever way. It explains the laughable Blood Wars and tries to get you to care about the main character. I'm currently watching it right now and the nose plugs alone are killing me. You'll understand that reference if you decide to take the awful journey that is this movie.  Characters: 5  Cinematography/Visuals: 2 During the making of this, someone actually presented the idea, "So how cool would it be if the main character could change outfits on the spots like three times in every scene?" The worst part is, someone actually agreed with that dunderhead. The outfits are only a smidge of what makes the cinematics so bad. The special effects are a nightmare which bog down the actions scenes. The world itself is so cardboard that you feel like a backdrop will fall down at any moment. I really don't know what the angle was here.  Conflict: 3 Every single bodyguard in this world should be fired. I really don't think the main character gets touched the entire movie as she tears through people left and right. My annoyance level was through the roof with the weak action sequences from start to finish. They were focused too much on making things look cool than they were having actual scenes with meat.  Entertainment Value: 3 After you get done cringing at how bad this movie is, you will finally settle in. You might just have a laugh or two at how utterly ridiculous and stupid this movie is. That, to me, is worthy of a 3.  Memorability: 4  Pace: 3 At one point during the movie, when they had a chance to dive full into more action, they decide instead to have a sequence where the main character and the boy she is protecting stop to play at a playground. This should tell you all you need to know about how slow this movie moves. The fact that you really don't understand what's happening the entire movie only serves to make things even worse. Nightmare.  Plot: 5 I am being very generous. I will admit I do have a soft spot in my heart for sci-fi as I feel there are a lot of moving parts with character building and world creation.  With Ultraviolet, it's not just bad sci-fi, it's bad PERIOD.  Resolution: 4  Overall: 32 I will leave you with this: Sitting through this movie will make you a dumber person. That is all.
Utter pants. Tries to be something classic, set int he 1950's, it has a retro feel but falls very very short of... well.. anything. Pointless gore, unbelievable story line, and very poor acting. Give it a miss, I watches 1.2 hours and then gave up. Very very poor.
I was channel surfing and got sucked in to this film. Can't really say that I enjoyed it.
Weak, lackadaisical script that swings back and forth, only broken up by dialogue so rote as to seem like it's on purpose. "Where's he at?" "A remote, undisclosed location". Cops don't talk like that, especially dirty ones. But these do.  Willis, Meloni, and Bautista do what they can. And I'm sure the money was good. Grenier highlights, again, why he's not big-screen material.   A shame, too, because the bank robber's masks are the coolest since Point Break. Dead Presidents.
A question comes to your mind when see a bunch of talented actors hamming it up in a really badly written movie; why did they even sign this?? This film is a perfect example of that thought. James Franco, Kate Hudson & Tom Wilkinson have made a name for themselves in their respective genres. But here they are reduced to being just punching bags for lesser known actors. With a predictable plot; a debt ridden couple steal from a gangster & hells breaks loose, not much can be done. Well this may have been done like 200 times already, doesn't make it any better. Director Henrik Ruben Genz manages to keep a scene or two interesting & does try to quench our thirst with a bloody climax, but unfortunately the damage done is to far gone. Good People has a talented & a likeable cast, but the mundane plot & sluggish screenplay, make this film very hateful!
the killer shrews are just dogs with masks on...but the movie is quite tense & scary.silly ending though
If wasn’t for the John Wick movies Keanu Reeves would be stuck in dismal films like this. Oh wait he is stuck in Films like this. Siberia has an interesting plot but the movie itself is a bore. Boring dialogue, bland acting, and a messy script. It’s what you expect from your typical direct to dvd movie. 
Very uninteresting and nonchalant.
A long, drawn-out movie with labored dialogue and plot.
I gave this a try... I really tried hard to give it a chance, but it just couldn't hold me. It felt pretentious, slow, and pointless. The setting was beautiful though. But not enough to get me to care enough to finish the film.
Disappointing movie. Obviously popular but I cannot see the appeal.
not good. it was trying to go for a tone that wasn't hitting me right. it just seemed off for most of the movie. it was hard to tell when it was trying to be funny. and it was frequently confusing with respect to knowing what was happening in the scene, who was shooting at who, who everyone is and who's side they're on. it was cool in some ways but mostly bad with lots of dumb sprinkled in. (1 viewing)
Not worth watching for free let alone paying to see it. Even a great cast and idea for a movie couldn't stop this poorly written catastrophe.
Yet another "giant animals attack via bad optical printer effects and ridiculous rubber props" film from schlock-meister Bert I. Gordon (see also "The Beginning of the End", "Village of the Giants", "Empire of the Ants", and "Earth vs. the Spider").  I'm pretty sure there were actual on-screen rat deaths in this film, so be warned.  Or better yet, don't even waste your time with this film in the first place.
The idea for the story was interesting and acting from Brad Pitt was impressive despite the awkward script. Jolie's character never hit a convincing depth, which unfortunately broke the movie. To top, the backing music felt cheesy and desperately overcompensating for how flat the movie was.. Overall, a strange Hollywood imitation of art house.
Yeah. This movie's bad. But... is it even worth me getting angry over it? It's just bland, cliche'd, and unoriginal. Not terrible, but definitely a dud.  3/10
Review: This movie had the potential to be quite good, but once the funny looking monsters came into play, it just went from bad to worse. There is some intensity throughout the movie but the acting wasn't that great and the storyline was all over the place. For some unknown reason, I was interested in what was going to happen to the crew, who was stuck in the middle of Mars with aliens running all over the place, but there wasn't any explanation about what was happening. All of the interesting characters got killed off early so you just knew that the main actor, Liev Schreiber, was going to be the last man standing. Anyway, for a movie that is very much unheard of, it's not all bad but it's not that brilliant. Average!  Round-Up: I haven't really seen Liev Schreiber play that many leads which is why a lot of people haven't heard of him. When you see his face, you will recognise him in movies like The X-Men , The Butler and Salt, but he doesn't really stick out from the rest. I was glad to see Elias Moteas in this movie, who played the captain of the crew, but his role was cut short. He's another one of those actors who is unheard of but he has played major roles in Shutter Island, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button and The Thin Red Line. I also liked Olivia Williams, who plays Kim, but her role was also cut short. Judging by the money that this movie made, it really didn't go down well at the box office which is mainly due to the director who killed off all of the interesting character way to early.Â   Budget: $7million Worldwide Gross: $24,000 (Terrible!)  I recommend this movie to people who are into there sci-fi movies a mission to Mars that goes terribly wrong after a crew member discovers something strange. 3/10
only good if you are a 9-12 yo girl, otherwise its a skip... too simple and really there is no story to it
Nice bikes but dialog and plot suck.
As a romance genre hater, I'm gonna review this movie a harshly. First, the cast is the worst possible cast anyone would've ever casted. The performances were so cheesy and inconceivable I found it hard not to feel sorry for actors. Second, the script is so poorly written a middle schooler would've done better. Third and lastly, why would anyone want to remake such a story in this era?! The entire idea was bad from the start. Sadly (not really) I've seen low budget films better than this one.
this movie totally stunk
A boring Movie where a girl is possessed by a demon.  Dark Movie that doesn't show a lot of action, and a convoluted script that does not flow well, I give this movie 1 and 1/2 stars.
Could have been a great story but it bored me
Why were the pokemon so scary? absolutely whack movie
good god! SKIP IT! So cringy but not in the way of the first ones. This movie is cringy on accident.
I am not saying I wasted time watching the movie, even my Country is on Lock because of the Pandemic, but surely I was expecting a lot more of it.  The Character Tyson is a complete decal of another Gangster Movie I once saw, from the Balkans. Rane(Wounds) Svaba Character is copied and exploited several times in the Movie.   All I can say if you are into the whole topic, you should have seen the film. But to me, the TV-Series "Gamorra" was made better than this semi sellout "Lemon Popsicle".   The acting performances from some of the main cast were also very questionable.
It was just as bad as hell
Boring and bad acting
Horrid acting and the subject matter is not one that many can relate to so the story and character development is weak as well.
If you like looking at beautiful naked 17 year old girls and don't care about a good script and good acting this movie is probably okay.  Nice shots of Rio and hooters are about all this movie offers.
Didn't the Fat Boys make this movie 10 years prior? Anyways, this is some forgettable crap.
almost a decent movie, until the sudden, confusing and half arsed ending...
all time i just hear light scream like teenage girl
The only thing not painful about the film is the location set.
So bad it's funny.  This must have looked embarrassingly cheesy since day one.
Snatched is a disappointing film. It is about a young woman persuades her ultra-cautious mother to travel with her to paradise after the young woman's boyfriend dumps her. Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn give horrible performances. The script is badly written. Jonathan Levine did a terrible directing this movie. I was not impressed with this motion picture.
A strong cast does not help this movie achieve what you are expecting, but still an interesting enough story about some of the scum of society.
all the bickering and jealousy..  By The Sea  By The Sea is a character driven romantic drama about a couple whose honeymoon goes haywire after jealousy and treachery gets in between them.   The chemistry fuels this overridden drama to reach newer territories without fumbling where the audience wouldn't mind taking a ride along with them, no matter how annoying the couple grows with all the bickering and jealousy. But, even as strong as chemistry like such could never replace the substance over style. And the primary reason why the feature is stuck on a dull loop, is because of the genre of the premise.   It requires the weaving of the structure in front of the audience and it is such poorly written with no bars held, that emotions set out were so not what the emotions come out. The narration is dry with probably somewhat gripping screenplay that too wears out latter, as the policies grows pretentious, the gist loud and the emotions shallow.   The background score may as well be non existent on terms of its factoring, the cinematography is redundant along with poor editing and on the up side it has stunning visuals, live locations and is beautifully shot. Pitt is more "Mr. And Mrs. Smith"-y than when he was in it, whilst Jolie is milking way too much to keep the crisp alive. The talent that actually goes waste by is Laurent that is convincing on her supporting role.   Jolie's execution has definitely improved a lot, but the script is the actual culprit in here that holds the ideology narrower and keeps it intact of its self-created pathos scrutiny. The chemistry among the lead cast, few one liners and visual aesthetics are the only high points of the feature.   By The Sea is a bore; I'll just say it straight out, it is a bore to a point where even the somewhat visible craft isn't appreciative.
I just did not like it. I am no movie critic, so I can not write a bunch of crap to simply say the movie was a disappointment for me.
Some good ideas, but it just falls on its face with silly agendas.
The only redeeming thing about this film is how hilarious it is to watch, completely drunk, with a group of equally drunk friends.
Really boring. The baddy is tedious, the deaths off screen and uninspiring. With so many more imaginative horrors over the years this has less fear factor than an episode of Doctor Who.
I don't really remember much about this one...
This had potential Then it was all over the place... When you think it might be interesting it fades away to poor editing 
This film is trash. It is full of outdated tropes & unrealistic expectations and results. Itï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s black mediocrity held together by Tiffany haddish, Omari hardwick, Amber Riley & random comedic cameos.   Itï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s a reverse gender romantic comedy, itï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s terrible. This film should be missed by all.
I'm actually the clown for watching this filth.
You know the routine: boring, uninteresting, and forgettable.
This movie is the worst film ive seen in the cinema, hands down!
Extremely dissapointing big budget remake of "The Lift",Down(The Shaft,a terrible english release name)is a misfire from Dutch director Dick Mass.This is his own remake of the original film.With a rather impressive cast,Naomi Watts,Ron Pearlman and James Marshall,the film is basically the same plot with a higher body count.At a bit over two hours long,there is way too much unnessesary dialouge here.At times the film is just way too corny for it's own good,and does not have the B movie charm of the original.The film does have the distinction of being one of the last appearences of the World Trade Centers,being filmed before September the 11th.Down was a nice shot,but I prefer the original version.Just goes to show you that bigger budget is not always better!
Nothing special here.
Safely taking the spot of 'Most ridiculous Sci-Fi Movie of the year', which in 2017 was comfortably held by Geostorm, The Titan had plenty of potential. Yes, it was another story about stupid humans destroying the world, but it set out to tell a tale of genetically altering humans in order to save the species. From there, everything falls apart, with a deluge of clunky exposition, hack writing, stock characters and no real sense of discovery. Also, I think its safe to say that the film didn't have a scientific advisor, since the film is so full of inaccuracies and mistruths that I can't believe nobody on set brought it up. Maybe they did, but still the film expects us to believe that in only 30 years the Earth will be uninhabitable, our best hope for a new home is not Mars or the Moon but a satellite of Saturn, and that a person can survive in the desert without water for 3 days. The film skips over a lot of potentially fascinating things to focus on body horror tropes that have been done a thousand times before, and never allows us to understand what is happening, instead skipping straight to the end result. It may not be as insultingly stupid as Geostorm, but that's about the nicest thing I can say about it.
When you rip off the Wizard of Oz in one of the death scenes, you know you don't have a good horror movie.
Incoherent action scenes, generic characters, laughable effects and unwatchable filters. Only things going for it is It's somewhat slick directing and Jovovich.
It's a hot mess. It's safe to skip this one. I wish I had.
This movie is not worth your time
Cringey and very unneeded
This attempt of an arthouse Western movie is only 80 minutes long but feels like two hours. It's okay to tell a story slowly but you should never make your audience feel as if they just wasted their time. It doesn't help that the humor feels so out of place and random even the editing makes other scenes unintentionally funny. Some sequences are beautifully shot, but the pointlessly bittersweet ending really makes you want to forget you watched this. What was everyone involved thinking?
Hands of Stone has a good story to tell but does it in a very predictable and melodramatic way. The fall of Roberto Durán is portrayed in such a 'Hollywood' way, you have to roll your eyes at the desperate attempt for emotional dialogue. The film goes through so many plot points in rapid session, it fails to tell the important details of Durán's life that makes for a better story. The shaky cam during the fight scenes makes it difficult to follow the action in the ring and they don't seem greatly choreographed to begin with. Perhaps i've been spoiled by films like Creed that came out just last year and that film wasn't even about a real person. Hands of Stone feels like it doesn't have enough of a coherent message to portray exactly what it wants to be as a film. The acting is fine, the visuals of 70s Panama and 80s New York City is great. Hell, you even get a decent Don King impersonation but it is poor writing and a poor narrative that weighs down the film. Hands of Stone is a missed opportunity to cover the life of one of boxing's most influential figures and it's a damn shame.
Kinda lame. It's just a woman obsessing over a man and doing anything to be with him. Quirky comedy but more quirky than anything
A real bore of a period piece with a terrible performance from Colin Farrell and a lack luster performance from Jessica Chastain. Liv Ullman was the director and her talents as an actress do not translate to the directing field at least for this movie. The costumes are pretty decent and Samantha Morton is fine but other than that this movie is really a chore to sit through
This film is proof positive that an outstanding cast can't overcome a bad script and mediocre direction.  Judd and Jackson seem to only go through the motions in a film that begs you to turn it off before it's over and a storyline that appears epileptic in nature, sending you every which way but never really makes a decision where it wants to go. Ridiculous dialogue and acting round out this abomination.
I don't understand why two of the most famous and "powerful" actors in the world would invest time and money in a production that is not fun, interesting, poignant nor relevant which gives absolutely nothing to the viewer. I guess vanity has no limits.
Made for TV quality Chaplain gets PTSD, 
The first piece of incidental music sets the tone for this film, which is entirely produced for kids.
Hated this movie, that's all I have to say, boring, unfunny, more cliche than this is impossible and not recommended, that's all.
Dumbo the clown.  Decent premise but not very scary at all. Same old eli Roth gore disguised as scary.
I found myself shaking my head more than I did laughing. A lot of lazy uninspired humor.
A very bloody movie, with poor acting. Not a must see.
It has a lot of bad acted exagerated sex, I guy whose life is in danger and, what does he do? He screws like a bunny!!! Terrible story, he makes friends out of the nothing and the closure is, well, unexpected, but lame.   It didn't care to me it was a bad movie, just wanted to watch Keanu (big fan), but this was too much. They have tried to make a twisted, art house, version of John Wick, it turned into a John Weak, hahaha. But I forgive it all, Keanu :P
lol wont he stink a bit by now
So sad I paid for this :( 
funnier than the critics gave it credit for; Sandra deserves better material than this
Keanu Reeves plays as diamond merchant, Lucas Hill falling for Russian cafe owner, Katya (Ana Ularu) which further complicates matters. 
Decent plot and terrible acting by the leading roles Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Olivia Thirlby. Mr Rhys Meyers should have never left the pool table venues. He clearly does not have an acting background... It seems to be more worried about his looks in front of the camera, overacting in every scene and concentrating on making his voice sound charismatic rather than making his character believable. A movie that I have not been able to finish, had to skip scenes, and end up giving up.  What I fail to comprehend is why Mr. Rhys Meyers keeps getting roles when clearly he lacks the acting principles.
Few things take me out of a movie more than watching a lead character badly act their way through trying to play a musical instrument - I can just about handle it when it's a few minutes...but this was especially painful to watch because of the sheer amount of screen time dedicated to her career as a "virtuoso" violinist - scene after scene after scene of just agonizingly awkward fake playing...not once did I see her rosin her bow, and not a single one of them had a chin rest between them. I just can't .... Why?
A pesar del excelente reparto y el exitoso emplazamiento setentero, la torpe dirección hace que no haya apenas interés en el lento e insustancial desarrollo de una no demasiado interesante historia. No se muy bien por qué esto es un proyecto francés.
A pointless sequel, in which you will dislike the characters of the original to a point, you really don´t care if they get a happy ending.
While some scenes are rather scary, its an overall boring film with no real thrills and too many jump scares.
what the hell happened? they cut out nearly every traumatizing event and make it look much more cheery than it really was. The best example of this is Erma. They try to make the molester into a victim. God forbid you show the U-haul scene either, or billy, or literally anything. This movie feels like it never had the chance.
The professionals are correct on this film.  18%
It should be better than this
This sequel has Bland characters and a boring narrative with a plot that isn't whatsoever interesting.
Really disappointed at yet another dreadful script for one of my favourite books.  Badly cast, stupid additions, (a stray dog???) really just hopeless.   Is no-one brave enough to stick to the story, the characters, and wonderful dialogue from this rich and beautiful story book?
I really love Christiana Ricci, but this is a low budget dud. The story is completely nonsensical, the CGI effects would have been cheesey in 1998 and the writing is just abismal. C Ric is charming and flawless as always, but that's all that this cinematic mess has going for it.
Could be a good movie - but it got knocked out in the 50th minute - better things to do with my life ... 
feels like they were trying so hard to make a second equalizer they didn't think of good story or characters before they did it. No where near as good as first movie
Being a huge metal fan, I was excited about this movie and thought they really couldnt do much to turn me off from liking it. I was wrong. The movie is campy as hell, the dialogue is laughable about 80% of the time and the plot is hardly developed. The script writer shouldve been fired. Andy Biersack's acting shows signs of being solid in the future but ultimately hes only there to draw in a fan girl audience and the movie does nothing to hide that fact. The shining element of the movie are Remington Leith's vocal parts in my opinion. If you want a cheesy metal movie you can laugh at then here it is but if you want a deep gritty portrayal of the scene and music industry youll be mad at yourself for thinking this movie could deliver. Its not to be taken seriously which makes me think it did far more damage to the metal scene than good.
This film was doomed from the outset due to a deals for a dollar script.
Everthing Look Good But it too many *Stupid Jump scare* This Movie Should be get 3 star or higher if This Movie with out Jump Scare
So much talent. So little result.
H.G. Wells remains one of the greatest science fiction authors to have ever worked in the field, but leave it to the schlockmeisters Bert I Gordon and American Pictures International to turn his "Food of the Gods" into one of the campiest and most unforgivably silly sci-fi movies of all time.   This is a completely ridiculous picture that could have been fun if anyone involved with making it had been in on the joke. This takes itself way too seriously despite its meager aspirations. When you have a scene involving Marjoe Gortner being attacked by giant chickens, and it's played straight, there's a problem. The film is apparently supposed to be a parable for the dangers of pollution and modernization, but nobody involved with it was smart enough to pull that off.  In reality, it's never more than a dumb B horror movie. It focuses primarily on the giant rats, and that's probably because it's the only special effect the film pulls off convincingly. The aforementioned chickens are embarrassing, and the giant wasps are filmed in a way that it's nearly impossible to tell what they are. The giant rats at least look somewhat realistic, especially in the frequent scenes in which they are shot. I know this was made before anyone had ever formed PETA, but it looks like these rodents were actually shot and drowned. The final scene where they are flooded out looks like someone is making the world's worst soup. It's one of the funnier shots in the film.  I doubt this drive-in classic was what the author had envisioned when he wrote "The Food of the Gods" in 1904. It's absurd to the highest degree, but someone forgot to make it fun. Someone could have done something more with this source material.
A mediocre adaptation when it's all said and done, though I feel this version suffers greatly from following in the footsteps of the incredible 1993 version.   This film has no atmosphere at all, an attempt to invoke was attempted by casting a blue filter over everything inside of Misselthwaite but it just made the screen look dull and washed out. The manor is almost completely empty, devoid of furniture and of life, which makes it feel more like a stage set than the lived in Misselthwaite of the 1993 version. The garden is absolutely beautiful, which is the one redeeming feature of the film, though it looks like somewhere that's been abandoned for centuries rather than just a decade.   The cast is unimpressive. The child actors are decent enough, but they just don't have the energy of the 1993 cast. Mary, Dickon and Colin felt like genuine friends in that version, while in this one they seem quite awkward, with little to no chemistry between them. It doesn't help that Dickon is only introduced quite late into the film and is given a strange air of mystery until he finally appears; which is ironic as the mystery surrounding the sickly Colin is completely removed, Mary just finds him randomly and there's an awkward familiarity between them that doesn't suit either character.  Medlock doesn't have the fury and bite that she's famous for, she's just a bit cross now and again, and Martha is absolutely dreadful. She has none of the down-to-earth warmth that Martha is known for in the other adaptations, she's bossy yet somehow amazingly dull at the same time. They could have written her out and replaced her with a random servant girl and it wouldn't have made much difference. I never once got the impression that she cared for Mary in the slightest. Lord Craven has promise but he's woefully underused.  ​  Mary's characterisation is all over the place.  Instead of her being a spoilt brat who then grows into a spirited young woman, she just sort of darts between being mildly irritated, snobby, aggressive and then is suddenly happy-go-lucky and dreamy. Her storytelling gimmick gets old very quickly as if it only exists to pad out the film's runtime, and the flashbacks to her time in India are handled very poorly; they appear in the most random places and don't help with the already awkward pacing of the film. The actress is decent enough, she just wasn't given much to work with.   What does this film do right? Actually, the opening was outstanding, and it was nice to see that it stayed faithful to the book. Mary's isolation was very well done, and her actress nailed the desperation she must have felt. The scenes outside of the manor are beautiful, and while Mary's storytelling is very awkward, the transition to the dream-like moments is very pretty. The score is wonderful too.   I would recommend the 1993 version over this one, and even the 1947 version. This film may have done better had it been an original work inspired by The Secret Garden, rather than a direct adaptation.
-_-..........yet another shitty horror movie....well at least they tried something thats not paranormal, until the end when its basicly the whole plot. BUT they had me invested a bit. The premise is good, the acting is well and the science behind it is good too. Just the whole "what teens today will find scary" thing is totally OLD and boring!
A lizard shot close up, a little cut girl with polio, and a hero that likes to sing annoying songs on a ukulele...what's not to hate?  The 1950's with their short crew cuts and their barn dance parties...
